 After this story was published  Facebook came under harsh criticism from lawmakers in the United States and Britain  Read the latest  LONDON   As the upstart voter profiling company Cambridge Analytica prepared to wade into the 2014 American midterm elections  it had a problem The firm had secured a  15 million investment from Robert Mercer  the wealthy Republican donor  and wooed his political adviser  Stephen K  Bannon  with the promise of tools that could identify the personalities of American voters and influence their behavior  But it did not have the data to make its new products work So the firm harvested private information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users without their permission  according to former Cambridge employees  associates and documents  making it one of the largest data leaks in the social network s history  The breach allowed the company to exploit the private social media activity of a huge swath of the American electorate  developing techniques that underpinned its work on President Trump s campaign in 2016 An examination by The New York Times and The Observer of London reveals how Cambridge Analytica s drive to bring to market a potentially powerful new weapon put the firm   and wealthy conservative investors seeking to reshape politics   under scrutiny from investigators and lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic Christopher Wylie  who helped found Cambridge and worked there until late 2014  said of its leaders   Rules don t matter for them  For them  this is a war  and it s all fair   They want to fight a culture war in America   he added   Cambridge Analytica was supposed to be the arsenal of weapons to fight that culture war  Details of Cambridge s acquisition and use of Facebook data have surfaced in several accounts since the business began working on the 2016 campaign  setting off a furious debate about the merits of the firm s so called psychographic modeling techniques But the full scale of the data leak involving Americans has not been previously disclosed   and Facebook  until now  has not acknowledged it  Interviews with a half dozen former employees and contractors  and a review of the firm s emails and documents  have revealed that Cambridge not only relied on the private Facebook data but still possesses most or all of the trove Cambridge paid to acquire the personal information through an outside researcher who  Facebook says  claimed to be collecting it for academic purposes During a week of inquiries from The Times  Facebook downplayed the scope of the leak and questioned whether any of the data still remained out of its control  But on Friday  the company posted a statement expressing alarm and promising to take action  This was a scam   and a fraud   Paul Grewal  a vice president and deputy general counsel at the social network  said in a statement to The Times earlier on Friday  He added that the company was suspending Cambridge Analytica  Mr  Wylie and the researcher  Aleksandr Kogan  a Russian American academic  from Facebook   We will take whatever steps are required to see that the data in question is deleted once and for all   and take action against all offending parties   Mr  Grewal said Alexander Nix  the chief executive of Cambridge Analytica  and other officials had repeatedly denied obtaining or using Facebook data  most recently during a parliamentary hearing last month  But in a statement to The Times  the company acknowledged that it had acquired the data  though it blamed Mr  Kogan for violating Facebook s rules and said it had deleted the information as soon as it learned of the problem two years ago In Britain  Cambridge Analytica is facing intertwined investigations by Parliament and government regulators into allegations that it performed illegal work on the  Brexit  campaign  The country has strict privacy laws  and its information commissioner announced on Saturday that she was looking into whether the Facebook data was  illegally acquired and used  In the United States  Mr  Mercer s daughter  Rebekah  a board member  Mr  Bannon and Mr  Nix received warnings from their lawyer that it was illegal to employ foreigners in political campaigns  according to company documents and former employees Congressional investigators have questioned Mr  Nix about the company s role in the Trump campaign  And the Justice Department s special counsel  Robert S  Mueller III  has  demanded the emails of Cambridge Analytica employees who worked for the Trump team as part of his investigation into Russian interference in the election While the substance of Mr  Mueller s interest is a closely guarded secret  documents viewed by The Times indicate that the firm s British affiliate claims to have worked in Russia and Ukraine  And the WikiLeaks founder  Julian Assange  disclosed in October that Mr  Nix had reached out to him during the campaign in hopes of obtaining private emails belonging to Mr  Trump s Democratic opponent  Hillary Clinton The documents also raise new questions about Facebook  which is already grappling with intense criticism over the spread of Russian propaganda and fake news  The data Cambridge collected from profiles  a portion of which was viewed by The Times  included details on users  identities  friend networks and  likes   Only a tiny fraction of the users had agreed to release their information to a third party  Protecting people s information is at the heart of everything we do   Mr  Grewal said   No systems were infiltrated  and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked  Still  he added   it s a serious abuse of our rules  The Bordeaux flowed freely as Mr  Nix and several colleagues sat down for dinner at the Palace Hotel in Manhattan in late 2013  Mr  Wylie recalled in an interview  They had much to celebrate Mr  Nix  a brash salesman  led the small elections division at SCL Group  a political and defense contractor  He had spent much of the year trying to break into the lucrative new world of political data  recruiting Mr  Wylie  then a 24 year old political operative with ties to veterans of President Obama s campaigns  Mr  Wylie was interested in using inherent psychological traits to affect voters  behavior and had assembled a team of psychologists and data scientists  some of them affiliated with Cambridge University The group experimented abroad  including in the Caribbean and Africa  where privacy rules were lax or nonexistent and politicians employing SCL were happy to provide government held data  former employees said Then a chance meeting brought Mr  Nix into contact with Mr  Bannon  the Breitbart News firebrand who would later become a Trump campaign and White House adviser  and with Mr  Mercer  one of the richest men on earth Mr  Nix and his colleagues courted Mr  Mercer  who believed a sophisticated data company could make him a kingmaker in Republican politics  and his daughter Rebekah  who shared his conservative views  Mr  Bannon was intrigued by the possibility of using personality profiling to shift America s culture and rewire its politics  recalled Mr  Wylie and other former employees  who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had signed nondisclosure agreements  Mr  Bannon and the Mercers declined to comment Mr  Mercer agreed to help finance a  1 5 million pilot project to poll voters and test psychographic messaging in Virginia s gubernatorial race in November 2013  where the Republican attorney general  Ken Cuccinelli  ran against Terry McAuliffe  the Democratic fund raiser  Though Mr  Cuccinelli lost  Mr  Mercer committed to moving forward The Mercers wanted results quickly  and more business beckoned  In early 2014  the investor Toby Neugebauer and other wealthy conservatives were preparing to put tens of millions of dollars behind a presidential campaign for Senator Ted Cruz of Texas  work that Mr  Nix was eager to win When Mr  Wylie s colleagues failed to produce a memo explaining their work to Mr  Neugebauer  Mr  Nix castigated them over email  ITS 2 PAGES   4 hours work max  or an hour each   What have you all been doing    he wrote Mr  Wylie s team had a bigger problem  Building psychographic profiles on a national scale required data the company could not gather without huge expense  Traditional analytics firms used voting records and consumer purchase histories to try to predict political beliefs and voting behavior But those kinds of records were useless for figuring out whether a particular voter was  say  a neurotic introvert  a religious extrovert  a fair minded liberal or a fan of the occult  Those were among the psychological traits the firm claimed would provide a uniquely powerful means of designing political messages Mr  Wylie found a solution at Cambridge University s Psychometrics Centre  Researchers there had developed a technique to map personality traits based on what people had liked on Facebook  The researchers paid users small sums to take a personality quiz and download an app  which would scrape some private information from their profiles and those of their friends  activity that Facebook permitted at the time  The approach  the scientists said  could reveal more about a person than their parents or romantic partners knew   a claim that has been disputed When the Psychometrics Centre declined to work with the firm  Mr  Wylie found someone who would  Dr  Kogan  who was then a psychology professor at the university and knew of the techniques  Dr  Kogan built his own app and in June 2014 began harvesting data for Cambridge Analytica  The business covered the costs   more than  800 000   and allowed him to keep a copy for his own research  according to company emails and financial records All he divulged to Facebook  and to users in fine print  was that he was collecting information for academic purposes  the social network said  It did not verify his claim  Dr  Kogan declined to provide details of what happened  citing nondisclosure agreements with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica  though he maintained that his program was  a very standard vanilla Facebook app  He ultimately provided over 50 million raw profiles to the firm  Mr  Wylie said  a number confirmed by a company email and a former colleague  Of those  roughly 30 million   a number previously reported by The Intercept   contained enough information  including places of residence  that the company could match users to other records and build psychographic profiles  Only about 270 000 users   those who participated in the survey   had consented to having their data harvested Mr  Wylie said the Facebook data was  the saving grace  that let his team deliver the models it had promised the Mercers  We wanted as much as we could get   he acknowledged   Where it came from  who said we could have it   we weren t really asking  Mr  Nix tells a different story  Appearing before a parliamentary committee last month  he described Dr  Kogan s contributions as  fruitless  Just as Dr  Kogan s efforts were getting underway  Mr  Mercer agreed to invest  15 million in a joint venture with SCL s elections division  The partners devised a convoluted corporate structure  forming a new American company  owned almost entirely by Mr  Mercer  with a license to the psychographics platform developed by Mr  Wylie s team  according to company documents  Mr  Bannon  who became a board member and investor  chose the name  Cambridge Analytica The firm was effectively a shell  According to the documents and former employees  any contracts won by Cambridge  originally incorporated in Delaware  would be serviced by London based SCL and overseen by Mr  Nix  a British citizen who held dual appointments at Cambridge Analytica and SCL  Most SCL employees and contractors were Canadian  like Mr  Wylie  or European But in July 2014  an American election lawyer advising the company  Laurence Levy  warned that the arrangement could violate laws limiting the involvement of foreign nationals in American elections In a memo to Mr  Bannon  Ms  Mercer and Mr  Nix  the lawyer  then at the firm Bracewell   Giuliani  warned that Mr  Nix would have to recuse himself  from substantive management  of any clients involved in United States elections  The data firm would also have to find American citizens or green card holders  Mr  Levy wrote   to manage the work and decision making functions  relative to campaign messaging and expenditures  In summer and fall 2014  Cambridge Analytica dived into the American midterm elections  mobilizing SCL contractors and employees around the country  Few Americans were involved in the work  which included polling  focus groups and message development for the John Bolton Super PAC  conservative groups in Colorado and the campaign of Senator Thom Tillis  the North Carolina Republican Cambridge Analytica  in its statement to The Times  said that all  personnel in strategic roles were U S  nationals or green card holders   Mr  Nix  never had any strategic or operational role  in an American election campaign  the company said Whether the company s American ventures violated election laws would depend on foreign employees  roles in each campaign  and on whether their work counted as strategic advice under Federal Election Commission rules Cambridge Analytica appears to have exhibited a similar pattern in the 2016 election cycle  when the company worked for the campaigns of Mr  Cruz and then Mr  Trump  While Cambridge hired more Americans to work on the races that year  most of its data scientists were citizens of the United Kingdom or other European countries  according to two former employees Under the guidance of Brad Parscale  Mr  Trump s digital director in 2016 and now the campaign manager for his 2020 re election effort  Cambridge performed a variety of services  former campaign officials said  That included designing target audiences for digital ads and fund raising appeals  modeling voter turnout  buying  5 million in television ads and determining where Mr  Trump should travel to best drum up support Cambridge executives have offered conflicting accounts about the use of psychographic data on the campaign  Mr  Nix has said that the firm s profiles helped shape Mr  Trump s strategy   statements disputed by other campaign officials   but also that Cambridge did not have enough time to comprehensively model Trump voters In a BBC interview last December  Mr  Nix said that the Trump efforts drew on  legacy psychographics  built for the Cruz campaign By early 2015  Mr  Wylie and more than half his original team of about a dozen people had left the company  Most were liberal leaning  and had grown disenchanted with working on behalf of the hard right candidates the Mercer family favored Cambridge Analytica  in its statement  said that Mr  Wylie had left to start a rival firm  and that it later took legal action against him to enforce intellectual property claims  It characterized Mr  Wylie and other former  contractors  as engaging in  what is clearly a malicious attempt to hurt the company  Near the end of that year  a report in The Guardian revealed that Cambridge Analytica was using private Facebook data on the Cruz campaign  sending Facebook scrambling  In a statement at the time  Facebook promised that it was  carefully investigating this situation  and would require any company misusing its data to destroy it Facebook verified the leak and   without publicly acknowledging it   sought to secure the information  efforts that continued as recently as August 2016  That month  lawyers for the social network reached out to Cambridge Analytica contractors   This data was obtained and used without permission   said a letter that was obtained by the Times   It cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately  Mr  Grewal  the Facebook deputy general counsel  said in a statement that both Dr  Kogan and  SCL Group and Cambridge Analytica certified to us that they destroyed the data in question  But copies of the data still remain beyond Facebook s control  The Times viewed a set of raw data from the profiles Cambridge Analytica obtained While Mr  Nix has told lawmakers that the company does not have Facebook data  a former employee said that he had recently seen hundreds of gigabytes on Cambridge servers  and that the files were not encrypted Today  as Cambridge Analytica seeks to expand its business in the United States and overseas  Mr  Nix has mentioned some questionable practices  This January  in undercover footage filmed by Channel 4 News in Britain and viewed by The Times  he boasted of employing front companies and former spies on behalf of political clients around the world  and even suggested ways to entrap politicians in compromising situations All the scrutiny appears to have damaged Cambridge Analytica s political business  No American campaigns or  super PACs  have yet reported paying the company for work in the 2018 midterms  and it is unclear whether Cambridge will be asked to join Mr  Trump s re election campaign In the meantime  Mr  Nix is seeking to take psychographics to the commercial advertising market  He has repositioned himself as a guru for the digital ad age   a  Math Man   he puts it  In the United States last year  a former employee said  Cambridge pitched Mercedes Benz  MetLife and the brewer AB InBev  but has not signed them on 
Debates over privacy have plagued Facebook for years But the news that  Cambridge Analytica  a political data firm that worked on President Trump s 2016 campaign  was able to gain access to private data through the social network has sparked an unusually strong reaction among its users The hashtag  DeleteFacebook appeared more than 10 000 times on Twitter within a two hour period on Wednesday  according to the analytics service ExportTweet  On Tuesday  it was mentioned 40 398 times  according to the analytics service Digimind Cher was one such deserter  writing on Twitter that the decision to quit Facebook  although  very hard   was necessary because she loves the United States Brian Acton  a co founder of the WhatsApp messaging service  told his tens of thousands of followers on Tuesday to delete Facebook  The social network acquired WhatsApp in a  19 billion deal in 2014 For people who aren t celebrities or billionaires  the decision to abandon Facebook came reluctantly  because the platform often served as their sole connection to certain relatives  friends and professional opportunities Here  some newly Facebook free users of social media discuss why they left       Richard H  PerryA filmmaker in Los AngelesFor a long time now  Mr  Perry had wanted to leave Facebook He never felt comfortable knowing that the company had access to much of his personal information  In the months before the 2016 presidential election  he watched the social network become what he called  a garbage platform of ads and weird reposted articles and people that you care about exposing themselves as racists  But Facebook was also where Mr  Perry promoted his films  where he posted ads seeking help on the set  and where he communicated with colleagues and a  massive number  of his friends and relatives Until he heard about Cambridge Analytica  I suspected this stuff was going on  but this is the first time it s been plainly exposed   he said   It seems so malicious  and Facebook seems so complicit all the way up and down  like it doesn t care about its users  Mr  Perry  39  has since deleted his profile and plans to switch to Twitter and Instagram for his social media needs  It was an easy decision   he said   It s not going to be the end of the world        Dan ClarkA retired Navy veteran in MaineMr  Clark kept one Facebook account to chat with friends and a separate account to keep tabs on members of his family nationwide  This week  he deleted both  Facebook was the main platform I used to keep in touch with all of them  and it was a difficult decision to give it up   he said   But you have to stand for something  so I just put my foot down and said enough is enough  Mr  Clark  57  said he had already been angry with Facebook for censoring some of his posts  which he said expressed his staunchly conservative views but were  never evil or putting anybody down   He could not abide the idea that his personal information was also being sold or given away without his consent Before cutting the cord  Mr  Clark posted on Facebook inviting his contacts to ask him for his personal phone number  More than 100 people reached out within three days  There are just so many ways nowadays to stay in contact  phones  email  instant message  Gab  which is a social network that doesn t censor anything   he said   Facebook is more obsolete than people would think        Alexandra KleemanA writer on Staten IslandHer first experience with fake news   a Facebook post claiming that Pope Francis had endorsed Mr  Trump s candidacy   altered the way Ms  Kleeman looked at Facebook  It changed the psychological and emotional feel of the platform for me   she said   I don t have a great feeling when I log in  The Cambridge Analytica scandal led her to remove the Facebook app from her phone   I m not going to give them my engagement clicks   Ms  Kleeman  32  said  But she is keeping the messaging function open for professional purposes and will continue using Instagram She doesn t mind the idea that some personal data can be made public   she used to have a blog  she said  But the idea that my data could be used for purposes that I expressly don t want  that freaks me out        Paul MusgraveAn assistant professor in Amherst  Mass Twitter makes Mr  Musgrave feel depressed about the world  but Facebook is the social media platform he is trying to abandon As a political science teacher at the University of Massachusetts Amherst  Mr  Musgrave  36  feels a professional responsibility to keep abreast of the news and academic chatter hurtling at him in the form of tweets Facebook was more valuable to him as a  low key  offstage networking tool   a  replacement for end of year family newsletters  that allowed him to  passively keep up with people   he said  He joined the platform more than a decade ago and before that had been a member of Friendster  a precursor to Facebook But in 2016  while helping his mother during her campaign for a government position in Indiana  Mr  Musgrave discovered a  poisonous swamp  of content on the site  The Cambridge Analytica findings were even more disturbing  he said  This is a company that has Orwellian levels of data about us  truly Big Brother level  but it s behaving as if it has no social responsibility and is a purely neutral medium of communication   he said   That s what s really been scary  Having deactivated his Facebook account  with plans to delete it  he now worries about connecting with people who use the social network as their main conduit of communication  I m definitely pruning myself away from some of those really important branches   he said   I watch my own students try to navigate the world of apps and smartphones  and even they don t really know how the internet works outside these enclosed garden spaces        Ben GreenzweigAn entrepreneur in Westchester  N Y Once Mr  Greenzweig confirms that the 1 195 photos and 85 videos in his Facebook profile have downloaded  he plans to delete the account he has maintained for nearly a decade Mr  Greenzweig  40  said the Cambridge Analytica news was  the last straw   We have surpassed the tipping point  where the benefit now fails to outweigh the cost   he said   But I will definitely miss what the promise of Facebook used to be   a way to connect to community in a very global and local context  A year ago  Mr  Greenzweig was an  extraordinarily active  Facebook user who juggled conversations with friends  managed several groups  took out ads for his business and maintained professional contacts But on Tuesday night  in his final post  he asked his network to connect with him through email  LinkedIn  Twitter or phone  See everyone in the real world   he wrote

DUBLIN   As Ireland prepares to vote in May on a referendum on whether to repeal its ban on abortion  anti abortion campaigners can be seen rallying most weekdays on the streets of Dublin  outside Parliament  and at universities  news media buildings and the offices of human rights groups They arrive wearing body cameras and bearing placards with graphic images of aborted fetuses But not all of them are Irish Of the eight members of the anti abortion Irish Center for Bio Ethical Reform who protested outside the offices of The Irish Times on a recent weekday  only three   including the group s leader  Jean Engela   are Irish  The others include Americans and a Hungarian  We try to be as multinational as the abortion industry  and they make no apologies for sending in their international affiliates to pontificate to the Irish people   said Dr  Engela The protests   relatively small but highly visible here in the Irish capital   are an emblem of the strong emotions as the country prepares to vote in late May on whether to retain the Eighth Amendment of the Irish Constitution  which bans abortion in nearly all circumstances and was itself enacted by a referendum  in 1983   Abortion was illegal before 1983  but the amendment made it even harder to terminate a pregnancy  even to save to mother s life  To the age old debates around abortion   including questions of when life begins and of women s control over their reproductive rights   the referendum has added a new dimension of concern about potential outside interference in the vote An ethics regulator recently ordered two abortion rights groups  Amnesty International Ireland and the Abortion Rights Campaign  to return grants of  150 000 and  25 000 to George Soros s Open Society Foundations  It said the money was a foreign political donation intended to affect the outcome of a referendum or election  and therefore banned But so far it does not appear that any anti abortion groups have been asked to return overseas donations  despite reports that money is being openly raised on their behalf  particularly in the United States One American group  the Pro Life Action League  told an Irish newspaper in 2012 that anti abortion groups were raising hundreds of thousands of dollars to support Irish anti abortion groups like Youth Defence  which has been linked to far right movements in Europe Youth Defence did not respond to a request for comment  The Pro Life Action League s executive director  Eric J  Scheidler  said that the remarks concerned American support for the Irish anti abortion movement over several decades  and said his group had not raised money for the current campaign The Irish Center for Bio Ethical Reform  which picketed The Irish Times  receives foreign funding but claims to be exempt from government oversight   We are an educational body   Dr  Engela said He denied that the protest had anything to do with the coming vote  and asserted that some of the volunteers were full time activists with their own sources of funding Some commentators argue that anti abortion groups are not being held to the same stringent standard as abortion rights groups Theresa Reidy  a political scientist at University College Cork  said that there was a long history of overseas interests taking sides in Irish referendums  particularly on issues like the European Union  Over the last decade  even as support for the abortion ban has waned  concerns about possible outside interference have risen  she said Siobhan Mullally  of the Irish Center for Human Rights at the National University of Ireland  Galway  said the problem of undeclared foreign funding went beyond the abortion debate  and was  also a question about how charities are funded in general  The Roman Catholic Church  long a major power in Ireland  was the main driver in the 1983 referendum  The church also opposed  successfully  a referendum in 1986 that would have legalized divorce  In the decades since  however  its social and moral authority has been gravely weakened by a number of scandals  most notably clerical child sex abuse The church could not prevent the legalization of contraception and was on the losing side in referendums that legalized divorce in 1995 and same sex marriage in 2015 As a result  today s anti abortion activists are less overtly religious in their arguments  Instead  they are turning to arguments that abortion harms women s health  They are also turning to social media tools After recent revelations about the misuse of Facebook data to sway Britain s referendum on European Union membership in 2016  and the United States presidential election later that year  fears are growing similar tactics might be used in the referendum campaign The Save the 8th Campaign  an anti abortion group  has hired Kanto Systems  a London based political consultancy  to help run its campaign Kanto Systems s founder  Thomas Borwick  was chief technology officer for the Vote Leave campaign in Britain  and developed a canvassing app for Cambridge Analytica  the data mining organization that exploited Facebook data on behalf of the 2016 Trump campaign Mr  Borwick said that he himself had not worked for the Trump campaign  and referred a reporter to a statement from Save the 8th  which said that Kanto would be performing  some data analytics for us  but would not be engaged in  any voter profiling or voter targeting  John McGuirk  a spokesman for Save the 8th  said that in the Irish electoral system  which does not have online voter rolls  individually targeted advertising of the sort practiced by Cambridge Analytica would not be possible   In terms of targeting advertising at individual voters  we couldn t do that even if we wanted to  which we don t   he said The Times of London reported that the Pro Life Campaign  Ireland s largest umbrella anti abortion group  has retained uCampaign  a Washington firm that has developed apps for the Trump campaign  the National Rifle Association  the Republican National Committee and Vote Leave   Neither uCampaign nor the Pro Life Campaign responded to requests for comment  The Transparent Referendum Initiative  a small group of Irish technology advocates  said it had already detected paid social media campaigns stealthily targeting Irish voters  This month  the group introduced a crowdsourced monitoring tool to detect and investigate anonymous or vaguely sourced paid advertising on Facebook  It has already identified 92 such ads relating to the Irish referendum  55 with anti abortion messages and 37 in support of abortion rights Political advertising is banned on Irish television and radio  but the online world is a different matter  There is no law against someone anywhere else in the world signing a commercial contract with a British company to use foreign money or unknown money  that is not going through any official regulated campaign  in order to influence an Irish vote   said Liz Carolan of the Transparent Referendum Initiative   There s a serious vulnerability in our democratic system  And it s now being exploited by incredibly sophisticated campaign techniques  and Facebook doesn t have to tell us who s doing it  Responding to the Cambridge Analytica revelations  the Irish government announced last week that it planned to give Irish regulators new powers to curb external influence on Irish voters A spokeswoman for Facebook s Dublin office said that the company agreed with the need for more transparency in advertising  and that it was developing a new tool to help people identify paid ads in their timelines and to identify and label political content  However  she said  the tools will not be ready in time for the May referendum

Good Wednesday  Here s what we re watching   Are we witnessing the end of the tech mania   Amazon has shed more than  50 billion in market value  Are investors waking up to Tesla s real problem   Mark Zuckerberg agreed to testify before Congress   SoftBank and Saudi Arabia are planning the world s largest solar energy project Get this in your inbox each morning  Sign up here Investors  always willing to believe in technology companies  spent the last three years piling into the shares of companies like Facebook  Amazon and Netflix with special abandon  Now the intellectual underpinnings of the tech rally are being seriously tested Stocks in the best known tech companies have plunged in recent days  The NYSE FANG  index  which tracks the share price of 10 companies  including Facebook  Apple and Amazon  has fallen nearly 14 percent from its recent high  Given that the index has soared 50 percent in just the past 12 months  the recent decline could just be the sort of sell off that punctuates any long term rally Still  several large tech companies suddenly face challenges that could undermine their ability to transform whole industries  And as we ve seen after previous fervors  investors can take a long time to regain their faith Facebook is down 20 percent from its recent high  Most of the slide came after news reports showing how the company s data was misused  Investors have to grapple with the possibility that Facebook won t be sharing as much data as it does  undermining its ability to generate ever increasing amounts of advertising revenue Nvidia  a computer chip maker intent on being a leader in automated driving technology  is off 12 percent from its recent high  The company said on Tuesday that it would halt tests of its autonomous driving technology on public roads after an Uber self driving car hit and killed a pedestrian in Arizona Tesla is not a tech stock  but it is included in the FANG  index  and its supporters believe deeply in its power to revolutionize the auto industry  Growing fears about Tesla s ability to finance its expansion have helped drag its stock down 33 percent from its recent high  Ominously  the price of Tesla s bonds is also falling  signaling that the company is losing the confidence of creditors Of course  on their march higher  tech stocks overcame obstacles  like management problems at Uber and the poor performance of Snap s initial public offering But the latest problems have raised deeper  broader doubts  and that may keep the uncertainty around longer  Investors have viewed automated driving technology as a huge potential source of growth for some companies  But after the Uber incident in Arizona  those companies may take a more realistic look at what they have to spend to create a technology that is efficient and safe  and conclude that they have to pull out of the race or pare back  Users of social media and regulators may prevent social media companies from sharing so much of their data with advertisers  and that could restrain revenue growth And if the passion for two or three big tech companies wanes  the cooling may spread   Peter EavisThe reason Reports that President Trump wants to rein in the e commerce giant Jonathan Swan of Axios  citing anonymous sources  reported Mr  Swan added Shares of Amazon have tumbled more than 7 percent at one point Wednesday  but they pared those losses after a White House official told Reuters there were no specific policy changes related to Amazon being considered at the moment  But the official added that the administration is always looking at different options on a range of policy issues How concerned should investors be GBH Insights analyst Daniel Ives writes Guess which companies are benefiting from Amazon s woes  Retailers  the FT points out On a day when the stocks on Wall Street are flat  Macy s was up 3 5 percent  J C  Penney has gained 5 5 percent  Walmart rose 1 7 percent  Target increased 1 8 percent  and Kohl s was up 2 4 percent The electric carmaker s shares are down 7 percent Wednesday  after plunging 8 percent on Tuesday Tuesday s slide was driven  in part  by the National Transportation Safety Board s announcement that it was investigating a fatal crash last week involving a Tesla vehicle in California  News that Jaguar Land Rover was teaming up with Alphabet Inc  s Waymo unit probably didn t help either But the continued decline in Tesla s stock   its shares are down more than 20 percent since mid March   speaks to the bigger concern surrounding Tesla  How it funds itself Investors have grown increasingly worried as Tesla burns through cash and struggles to meet its own production goals for the Model 3  Late Tuesday  Moody s downgraded Tesla s credit rating further into junk territory and said its outlook on the company is negative  The credit ratings agency cited production delays and said Tesla may soon need to raise more than  2 billion Those concerns can be seen not just in Tesla s stock price but also in the trading of its debt  The FT points out that  Tesla s eight year bond maturing in 2025 traded on Wednesday at 87 6 cents to the dollar  the lowest since issuance  The yield has surged to 7 5 percent from 6 59 percent on Monday  Liam Denning of Bloomberg Gadfly writes The fallout from Facebook s Cambridge Analytica scandal has spread to Twitter The stock tumbled 12 percent Tuesday after Citron Research s Andrew Left said he was betting against the social media company because of its vulnerability to regulation around how it handles user data But analysts at Barclays disagree  They argue in a recent note to clients that Twitter s data business likely won t be impacted much by any regulation on its use of user data  The credit reporting company named Mark Begor  a private equity executive who once led General Electric s credit card business  as its new chief executive Mr  Begor  59  takes over for Paulino do Rego Barros Jr   who has filled the role on an interim basis since September  when Richard F  Smith stepped down after a data breach exposed sensitive personal information  including Social Security numbers  of 148 million people Mr  Begor will start at Equifax on April 16 About Mr  Begor  The 59 year old is a managing director at the private equity firm Warburg Pincus  He is also a member of the board at the credit scoring company FICO   Mr  Begor spent 35 years at General Electric  where his duties included leading the conglomerate s real estate investment and energy management units  For nine years  he was president and chief executive of the company s consumer credit business  which was later spun off as Synchrony Financial His pay packageEquifax said it would give Mr  Begor stock and options valued at  17 million this year and an annual salary and bonus of up to  4 5 million President Trump has scored a significant trade deal with South Korea But with Mr  Trump preparing to meet with North Korea s leader  Kim Jong un   who just took an armored train trip to Beijing   and the North apparently pressing on with nuclear developments  an  America first  trade stance was far from the only thing pushing the South to sign  More from Michael D  Shear and Alan Rappeport The Trump administration continues to ramp up its trade rhetoric with China  Unidentified sources told Bloomberg that it is considering invoking an emergency law to restrict Chinese investments in sensitive U S  tech  A separate plan to enact tariffs on  60 billion of Chinese goods has left companies wondering which industries will be targeted  Other Asian countries increasingly fear being caught in the crossfire of a trade war  the WSJ reports And nations are already reacting to Trump s trade moves  erecting  barriers to stop the steel and aluminum that faces tariffs in the U S  being dumped in their markets Against this background  NXP sold its 40 percent stake in a Chinese joint venture on chip design Companies like Facebook  Amazon and Alphabet have delivered some of the best returns to investors in recent years  powered by the achievements and the promise of social media and artificial intelligence But that confidence is evaporating  as investors brace for intensified regulatory scrutiny across the industry  Tech stocks took a pummeling yesterday and in early European trading Twitter dropped 12 percent after Andrew Left s Citron Research said it was shorting the company Critic s corner  The  sector s growing clout over everyday life also raises the risks of what can go wrong   Dan Gallagher argues at WSJ s Heard on the Street The public outcry over Facebook s data and privacy settings has grown loud enough that Mark Zuckerberg now says he s willing to testify to Congress  The company is on a hiring spree for lobbyists  too  and unnamed sources say it s putting off the promotion of new home products The man who started all this  the Cambridge Analytica whistle

tumbled 8 2 percent  after the National Transportation Safety Board said it was conducting its second crash investigation of the year involving one of the company s cars  There s also anxiety about whether it will hit production goals Uber said it would not renew its California permit for self driving vehicle tests until investigations were complete in Arizona  And it s facing questions over a

Good Tuesday  Here s what we re watching   So you want to be Deutsche Bank s next C E O     Investors are selling tech again   Will Wall Street s top regulator keep going after bad bankers   More potential limits on gun sales  Facebook s growing political troubles  Uber s self driving travailsGet this in your inbox each morning  Sign up here Imagine you are applying to be the C E O  of Deutsche Bank now that it s reportedly seeking a successor to John Cryan  the bank s current chief You survey the bank s numbers to get a sense of the opportunities and challenges you d face Staring you in the face is the stock price  down nearly 30 percent this year  Ugly  but it could be a good entry point  It gives you time to try out some tough measures aimed at improving Deutsche Bank s performance  Even if those moves produce near term losses  the stock may not dive  given how far it s already fallen Then you look at the strength of Deutsche Bank s capital  as expressed by a regulatory measure called the common equity tier 1 capital ratio  That s at 14 percent  a solid looking level  achieved in part by an  8 billion equity raise last year  In theory  you have something to spend on your chosen plans But then you realize that Deutsche Bank s share price is now back at the level at which the bank sold those shares  Shareholders must be livid  Not only that  Deutsche Bank s stock market value is less than 40 percent of its net worth as stated on its balance sheet  its stock price is  11 30 and its book value per share is  30 16   When a company trades at a hefty discount to its net worth  it either needs to raise a lot of new capital  which doesn t seem to be the case at Deutsche Bank  or investors have serious doubts about the company s business model  So  I ll rejig the bank s business model   you say to yourself   that s what new C E O  s do  You look for ways and stumble upon an unavoidable obstacle  Deutsche Bank is heavily dependent on Wall Street revenue  which can be far more unpredictable than revenue from other businesses  Last year  revenue from Deutsche Bank s corporate and investment bank  which has struggled to keep up with its peers  accounted for 54 percent of the bank s overall revenue  Compare that with JPMorgan Chase  whose investment bank accounted for a third of its revenue last year  And you are stuck with the Wall Street operations  no one wants to buy an investment bank with  1 2 trillion in assets Maybe you can cut costs  another go to tactic of an incoming C E O  Indeed  Deutsche Bank s investment bank employees seem better paid than their counterparts at other firms  Going by a back of the envelope calculation  the unit s compensation expense is equivalent to 44 percent of its revenue  excluding the interest the investment bank earns on its assets   That s higher than the 39 percent ratio for JPMorgan s investment bank last year  and 41 percent for Goldman Sachs  Maybe you could slash the pay of bankers and traders Sorry  Mr  Cryan tried that   Peter EavisThe roller coaster ride in tech continues The tech heavy Nasdaq Composite tumbled nearly 3 percent  while the Dow Jones industrial average and the S  P  500 fell 1 4 percent and 1 7 percent Tech companies in the S  P  500 tech sector slid 3 4 percent  the steepest decline among the index s 11 main sectors Chip makers were among the hardest hit on the day  Shares of Nvidia dropped 7 8 percent after it said it was halting tests on self driving cars Nvidia s slide weighed on the shares of rival chip makers  Micron Technologies fell 5 7 percent  and AMD dropped 4 2 percent But semiconductor companies were hardly the only ones getting pummeled  The famed FANG stocks  among the biggest gainers over the past year  tumbled Tuesday  Facebook  Amazon  Netflix and Google parent Alphabet all finished down more than 4 5 percent Tesla tumbled 8 2 percent on news that the National Transportation Safety Board is conducting its second investigation this year into a Tesla car crash  The stock is off nearly 20 percent since March 12 on increasing concerns that the electric car maker will fall short of its production goals for the Model 3 Twitter dropped 12 percent after Andrew Left s Citron Research said it was shorting the social media company Tuesday s fall continued the recent volatility in American stocks  and specifically  the shares of tech companies  Enthusiasm about the technology sector had long propelled stock markets to new heights  But the specter of intensifying regulation of the industry has taken the sheen off  Last week tech stocks dragged the broader markets to their worst week in more than two years  The selling took a break on Monday as the S  P  500 s tech sector rose 4 percent pushing the index to its best day in almost three years A vigorous debate is taking place over who should become the next head of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York  a powerful regulator on Wall Street s front lines Contenders for the post should address one question  What will you do to clean up the culture at banks William C  Dudley  the outgoing president of the New York Fed  had made improving the culture at the firms he oversaw a key initiative of his tenure of at the institution When Mr  Dudley took the helm in 2009  the financial crisis had left the New York Fed s reputation as a regulator damaged  The institution had not done enough to address the severe weaknesses at the banks it oversaw  like Citigroup  Early on  Mr  Dudley commissioned a review of the New York Fed s bank supervision department and then overhauled it  But in 2012  JPMorgan Chase  also overseen by the New York Fed  suffered huge trading losses in what was known as the London Whale scandal  The New York Fed was faulted Following the embarrassing London Whale imbroglio  Mr  Dudley used his bully pulpit to focus on bankers  ethics  Banks were stronger financially  but recent scandals showed that the culture of their firms still needed to improve  he observed  And if a cleanup didn t occur  it may be a sign that they needed to be reduced in size  Mr  Dudley said in a 2014 speech that rattled Wall Street The next big banking scandal   Wells Fargo s widespread mistreatment of customers  which came to light in 2016   strongly supported Mr  Dudley s arguments  Wells Fargo was considered one of the most stable  too big to fail  banks  with its focus on plain vanilla lending  but in fact  its retail sales culture had degraded  The Fed earlier this year slapped relatively harsh sanctions on the bank  including a limit on its size The example of Wells Fargo is pertinent for John C  Williams  a top candidate to replace Mr  Dudley  Mr  Williams is head of the San Francisco Fed  which oversees Wells Fargo And there is still work to do to fulfill Mr  Dudley s initiative  He proposed a  database of banker misconduct   similar to the one for brokers  that would track a banker s record on ethics and compliance  Banks could consult it before hiring  But this idea has not taken off  In a speech at the U S  Chamber of Commerce on Monday  Mr  Dudley explained why   Understandably  firms are concerned about legal risk if they share information about banker misconduct  but there may be ways to address these concerns through legislation  Mr  Dudley had also pressed banks  boards of directors to focus on ethical culture  On Monday  he said the boards had set up separate committees to focus on culture and conduct   We ve made part of the journey but I think more could be done   Mr  Dudley said  Whether it will  depends on who steps into his shoes   Peter EavisThe yield curve is near its flattest level since the financial crisis  The difference between the yields on the two year and 10 year Treasury notes is at 0 52 percentage points  not far off its post crisis low of 0 50 percentage points hit in January That has some asking if the nine year old economic recovery is at risk Since the end of World War II  no barometer has done a better job of predicting a recession than the yield curve  A flattening yield curve tends to indicate slowing economic growth in the near future  But what is more worrisome is if the yield curve goes beyond flattening and into outright inversion The chances of a recession when the yield curve is flattening is just 20 percent  according to the calculations of Jim Paulsen  the chief investment strategist at the Leuthold Group  That jumps to 72 percent when the curve inverts There is another reason not to be too concerned about a flattening yield curve  and it has to do with the actions of central banks around the world  The unprecedented stimulus from the Fed  Bank of Japan and E C B  have brought down long term rates  That means the yield curve might not be the predictor it once was A week after a self driving Uber vehicle hit and killed a woman in Arizona  the fallout continues to spread Nvidia on Tuesday said it had suspended self driving tests in New Jersey  Santa Clara  Japan and Germany  A Nvidia spokesperson said in a statement  using A V  as an abbreviation for automated vehicles  Nvidia s artificial intelligence platform is the

all already done so Roger Lanctot  an automotive technology analyst with Strategy Analytics  wrote Citigroup became the biggest Wall Street firm thus far to take actions to limit gun sales  Others  like JPMorgan Chase  Bank of America  Visa and Mastercard  are studying options   Bank of America and JPMorgan are two of the bankruptcy lenders to Remington Outdoor  along with Wells Fargo  which is the N R A  s bank of choice  In his latest column  Andrew suggests these new tactics   Credit card issuers and banks could give gun sellers who have announced restrictions on sales  like Walmart and Dick s Sporting Goods  a special merchant category code  That could help financial firms decide with whom they want to do business   Payment processors could geofence gun shows and enforce restrictions on transactions coming from those GPS coordinates Here s what Citi s C E O   Mike Corbat  told Andrew about his firm s actions Where to begin  The company faces inquiries from the Federal Trade Commission  the Senate Judiciary Committee  several state attorneys general and the watchdog group Common Cause  And Britain s Parliament asked Mark Zuckerberg to testify  he s sending a deputy

AggregateIQ  a digital marketer with ties to Cambridge Analytica Critics  corner  Nir Kaissar of Gadfly thinks that the big question is how many users value privacy more than having a Facebook account  Charlie Warzel of BuzzFeed argues the Cambridge Analytica scandal could lead to  a full scale personal and public reckoning that looks at the way we ve used the internet for the last decade  Bankers and deal lawyers may want to send some of their bonus to Amazon this year  M  A  activity is running at record levels and concerns about the e commerce giant have played a role in driving a number of the largest deals The latest  GlaxoSmithKline s decision to buy out Novartis s stake in their consumer health joint venture  which includes Sensodyne toothpaste  for  13 billion Amazon may not have been the main reason  but its impact on the pricing of consumer health products likely played a role Historically  such products have lower margins than prescription drugs  but customers that keep coming back  Sales  though  are slowing  up just 3 percent over the past two years  half the rate of the previous two  according to Morgan Stanley  Price competition from online retailers like Amazon has some worried it could decelerate further That partly helps explain why Novartis was willing to exit the business So why was Glaxo willing to pay up for the business 1  Starting this month Novartis had the right to require Glaxo purchase its stake in the joint venture  Doing the deal now removes uncertainty 2  The deal will allow its new chief executive to  get on with fixing GSK s pharmaceutical division  which suffers from a relatively lackluster pipeline of new drugs   writes Neil Unmack of Breakingviews  Shares of Glaxo have gained 6 3 percent The S  P  500 rose 2 7 percent yesterday  its best day in nearly three years  as President Trump would be happy to tell you   Maybe it s because  as Peter Eavis writes  the president s threats of a trade war with China might be merely negotiating tactics More from Peter  According to this view  the tariff proposal was a jarring move partly aimed at getting China to see that the U S  was serious about shifting trade terms  If China doesn t show real signs that it will do more to open its markets  Mr  Trump could up the ante   roiling the markets again  But the White House s more conciliatory tone yesterday after last week s sell off suggests there is not a strong desire for a full trade war But remember that Beijing is firmly committed to its industrial policy  while the U S  is equally adamant about letting American companies operate more freely in China   Even if G M  and Ford  who have joint ventures with Chinese companies  wouldn t benefit from a lower tariff on U S  car imports   And Stephen Roach of Yale

 Reuters    Facebook Inc is giving users more control over their privacy by making data management easier and redesigning the settings menu  the company said on Wednesday  in the wake of a scandal over a breach that exposed the personal information of millions and was allegedly used by a political consultancy The company also said it would propose in the coming weeks updates to the social media website s terms of service and data policy to better spell out what information it collects and how it uses it The company has faced a global outcry after a whistleblower said that data from millions of users was improperly harvested by consultancy Cambridge Analytica to target U S  and British voters in close run elections Facebook shares are down nearly 18 percent since March 16  when it first acknowledged that user data had been improperly channeled to Cambridge Analytica  eating away nearly  100 billion of the company s market value  We ve heard loud and clear that privacy settings and other important tools are too hard to find  and that we must do more to keep people informed   Erin Egan  Facebook s chief privacy officer  and Ashlie Beringer  its deputy general counsel  said in a statement In addition to redesigning its settings menu on mobile devices  Facebook said it is creating a new privacy shortcut menu where users would be able to better secure their accounts and control personal information  It would also allow users to review and delete data they have shared  including posts and search queries Users would be able to download the data shared with Facebook  including uploaded photos  contacts added to their account  and posts on timelines  Reporting by Philip George and Ismail Shakil in Bengaluru  Editing by Bernard Orr 
NEW YORK    Mozilla  Tesla and other companies are distancing themselves from Facebook following revelations of a major leak of user data to political consultants associated with the 2016 Trump campaign While the actions will not likely be permanent and won t have much of an effect on Facebook s bottom line  they re the latest fallout the social media giant has to contend with from the ever spiraling scandal   along with a tumbling stock price and a  deletefacebook movement  We re taking a break from Facebook   Mozilla said in a blog post on Wednesday  The company  which created the Firefox web browser  said it is  pressing pause  on its Facebook advertising and won t be posting on its Facebook page  But it did not delete its page and said it will consider returning if Facebook takes stronger actions to protect users  data and improves privacy settings German bank Commerzbank also said it was putting Facebook advertising  on hold  as it evaluates data security  And Sonos  which makes speakers and other electronics  said it is pulling advertising from Facebook  Instagram  Google  and Twitter for a week Elon Musk  meanwhile  made waves  saying in a Twitter exchange that he would take down the Facebook sites for his companies Tesla and SpaceX  As of Thursday afternoon  the sites appeared to be inactive  Tesla and SpaceX did not respond to a request for comment While the actions are likely temporary  they re one more piece of the growing headache for Facebook since news of the leak broke a week ago  It has faced criticism because CEO Mark Zuckerberg and COO Sheryl Sandberg did not speak out until five days after the story broke  The company s stock price shed 14 percent of its value this week  And the grumblings by users  and now  businesses shows no sign of abating  The Cambridge Analytica scandal  like many recent headlines coming out of Silicon Valley  raises questions about whether Big Tech is doing enough to balance its own interests with one of its biggest responsibilities  safeguarding your privacy   Sonos wrote in a blog post But Facebook downplayed the actions by the businesses  Most of the businesses we ve spoken with this week are pleased with the steps we ve outlined to better protect people s data  and they have confidence that we ll respond to these challenges and become a better partner and company as a result   the company said in a statement when asked about the advertiser defection The fact is  most advertisers need Facebook as a platform because its reach is so great  so any break is likely to only be temporary  said Allen Adamson  founder of brand marketing consultancy Metaforce  Companies can take a short term hiatus to get some positive spin in the market  but there s no other alternative for digital marketing today   he said   If you don t use Facebook  the other options are not great  
NEW YORK    Facebook is giving its privacy tools a makeover as it reels from criticisms over its data practices and faces tighter European regulations in the coming months The changes won t affect Facebook s privacy policies or the types of data it gathers on users  But the company hopes its 2 2 billion users will have an easier time navigating its complex and often confusing privacy and security settings  Facebook says it also wants to give users a simpler way to access and download the data it collects on them Wednesday s announcement follows revelations that a Trump affiliated consulting firm  Cambridge Analytica  got data on millions of Facebook users  That included information on friends of people who had downloaded a psychological quiz app  even though those friends hadn t given explicit consent to sharing  In addition  Facebook is also facing widespread criticism for collecting years of contact names  telephone numbers and call and text histories from Android users  The company has not said exactly what it used such data for or why it needed it  On Monday  the Federal Trade Commission said it is investigating Facebook over its privacy practices Facebook s chief privacy officer  Erin Egan  said in a blog post that most of the privacy updates have been in the works for  some time  but the events of the past several days underscore their importance  Facebook also said it plans to update its privacy policy and terms of service in the coming weeks  but gave no further details The company has tried over the years to simplify its privacy settings  yet the controls remain hard to find and use for many people  For example  Facebook announced in 2009 that it was consolidating six privacy pages and more than 30 settings on to a single privacy page Yet mobile users still had to go to nearly 20 different places to access all of their privacy controls  Now  Facebook says they will be accessible from a single place  Facebook says it is also adding  clearer explanations  about how its privacy controls work Chris Cox  Facebook s chief product officer  called the new settings  the first of many steps  the company is taking to address privacy concerns Facebook has been working on the changes in preparation for the European Union s General Data Protection Regulation  which were approved two years ago and take effect May 25  The rules are designed to make it easier for consumers to give and withdraw consent for the use of their data  They apply to any company that collects data on EU residents  no matter where it is based To comply with this  Facebook is adding a section called  access your information   a secure way for users to manage data they ve shared with the company  including status updates  comments and things they have searched for  That s where people can go to delete information or download a copy  While this download was already possible  it took some time to figure out how to do it  Cox said the changes let people browse through their information in detail  without having to download it  For example  users will now be able to look up a post from a specific date in the past Cox said that while the changes are  in line with the principle of GDPR   there s also a  bunch of stuff that goes above and beyond that  Facebook also said it will propose updates to its terms of service in the coming weeks and update its privacy policy  but gave no further details 
NEW YORK    The Latest on reports that millions of Facebook users  data was used to target political ads  all times local  3 30 p m Cook County is suing Facebook and Cambridge Analytica for fraud after revelations that the latter obtained data on millions of Facebook users The lawsuit filed Friday in Cook County Circuit Court alleges Trump affiliated political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica deceived the millions of Illinois Facebook users whose information it collected  It says Facebook failed to protect its users  privacy and misrepresented how their data would be used London based Cambridge Analytica has been accused of using Facebook data to influence voter behavior in U S  elections The Chicago Tribune reports the lawsuit filed by Cook County State s Attorney Kimberly Foxx on behalf of Illinois residents brings one consumer fraud count each against Facebook and Cambridge Analytica  It seeks  50 000 fines for each violation of the law Neither company has commented on the lawsuit    2 20 p m The chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee says he s invited Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to testify at a hearing next month on data privacy Sen  Charles Grassley of Iowa says the April 10 hearing will cover how consumer data is collected  retained and distributed for commercial use  He says the hearing also will examine what steps companies like Facebook can do to better protect personal information Grassley s committee is the third congressional panel to seek Zuckerberg s testimony in the wake of a privacy scandal involving Cambridge Analytica  a Trump connected data mining company Several Judiciary Committee members had pressed Grassley to hold the hearing Grassley says he s also invited Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey    12 15 p m The chief law enforcement officers for 37 U S  states and territories are demanding to know when Facebook learned of a huge breach of privacy protections The officers say in a letter Monday to CEO Mark Zuckerberg that users  trust in the social media platform is  broken  The attorneys general are asking how Facebook monitored what these developers did with all the data they collected and whether Facebook had safeguards to prevent misuse They also asked Zuckerberg for an update on how Facebook will allow users to more easily control the privacy of their accounts Cambridge Analytica  a political data mining firm  is accused of lifting data from some 50 million Facebook users to influence voters in U S  elections    11 55 a m Germany s justice minister says she wants closer oversight of companies such as Facebook  following a meeting with executives about the abuse of users  private data Katarina Barley says Facebook representatives assured her Monday that such breaches wouldn t occur again and pledged to inform those users who were affected She added that  promises aren t enough  though  We will need to monitor companies such as Facebook much more strictly in future and also punish breaches of data protection strongly  swiftly and painfully  Barley said Facebook reacted  favorably  to her demand for greater transparency about the algorithms that underpin the company s data collection She said campaigns such as  Delete Facebook  would likely make a strong impression on the company because  in the end the currency that Facebook works with is trust     10 50 a m The Federal Trade Commission is investigating Facebook s privacy practices following a week of privacy scandals including whether the company engaged in  unfair acts  that cause  substantial injury  to consumers Facebook s stock  which already took a big hit last week  plunged as a result Facebook said in a statement on Monday that the company remains  strongly committed  to protecting people s information and that it welcomes the opportunity to answer the FTC s questions News outlets have reported on the FTC investigation last week  but the FTC hadn t confirmed it until Monday  Facebook reached a settlement with the FTC in 2011 offering privacy assurances    5 a m Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is promising to do a better job protecting user data following reports that a political consultant misused the personal information of millions of the company s subscribers  The fact is  European regulators are already forcing him to do so A similar data breach in the future could make Facebook liable for fines of more than  1 6 billion under the European Union s new General Data Protection Regulation  which will be enforced from May 25  The rules  approved two years ago  also make it easier for consumers to give and withdraw consent for the use of their data and apply to any company that uses the data of EU residents  no matter where it is based 
NEW YORK    To get an idea of the data Facebook collects about you  just ask for it  You ll get a file with every photo and comment you ve posted  all the ads you ve clicked on  stuff you ve liked and searched for and everyone you ve friended   and unfriended   over the years Now  the company is under fire for collecting data on people s phone calls and text messages if they used Android devices  While Facebook insists users had to specifically agree  or opt in  to have such data collected  at least some users appeared surprised Facebook s trove of data is used to decide which ads to show you  It also makes using Facebook more seamless and enjoyable   say  by determining which posts to emphasize in your feed  or reminding you of friends  birthdays Facebook claims to protect all this information  and it lays out its terms in a privacy policy that s relatively clear and concise  But few users bother to read it  You might be surprised at what Facebook s privacy policy allows   and what s left unsaid Facebook s privacy practices have come under fire after a Trump affiliated political consulting firm  Cambridge Analytica  got data inappropriately from millions of Facebook users  While past privacy debacles have centered on what marketers gather on users  the stakes are higher this time because the firm is alleged to have created psychological profiles to influence how people vote or even think about politics and society Facebook defends its data collection and sharing activities by noting that it s adhering to a privacy policy it shares with users  Thanks largely to years of privacy scandals and pressure from users and regulators  Facebook also offers a complex set of controls that let users limit how their information is used   to a point You can turn off ad targeting and see generic ads instead  the way you would on television or in a newspaper  In the ad settings  you d need to uncheck all your interests  interactions with companies and websites and other personal information you don t want to use in targeting  Of course  if you click on a new interest after this  you ll have to go back and uncheck it in your ad preferences to prevent targeting  It s a tedious task As Facebook explains  it puts you in target categories based on your activity  So  if you are 35  live in Seattle and have liked an outdoor adventure page  Facebook may show you an ad for a mountain bike shop in your area But activity isn t limited to pages or posts you like  comments you make and your use of outside apps and websites  If you start typing something and change your mind and delete it  Facebook keeps those and analyzes them too   Zeynep Tufekci  a prominent techno sociologist  said in a 2017 TED talk And  increasingly  Facebook tries to match what it knows about you with your offline data  purchased from data brokers or gathered in other ways  The more information it has  the fuller the picture of you it can offer to advertisers  It can infer things about you that you had no intention of sharing   anything from your ethnicity to personality traits  happiness and use of addictive substances  Tufekci said These types of data collection aren t necessarily explicit in privacy policies or settings What Facebook does say is that advertisers don t get the raw data  They just tell Facebook what kind of people they want their ads to reach  then Facebook makes the matches and shows the ads Apps can also collect a lot of data about you  as revealed in the Cambridge Analytica scandal  The firm got the data from a researcher who paid 270 000 Facebook users to complete a psychological profile quiz back in 2014  But the quiz gathered information on their friends as well  bringing the total number of people affected to about 50 million Facebook says Cambridge Analytica got the data inappropriately   but only because the app said it collected data for research rather than political profiling  Gathering data on friends was permitted at the time  even if they had never installed the app or given explicit consent Ian Bogost  a Georgia Tech communications professor who built a tongue in cheek game called  Cow Clicker  in 2010  wrote in The Atlantic recently that abusing the Facebook platform for  deliberately nefarious ends  was easy to do then  What s worse  he said  it was hard to avoid extracting private data If  you played Cow Clicker  even just once  I got enough of your personal data that  for years  I could have assembled a reasonably sophisticated profile of your interests and behavior   he wrote   I might still be able to  all the data is still there  stored on my private server  where Cow Clicker is still running  allowing players to keep clicking where a cow once stood  Facebook has since restricted the amount of types of data apps can access  But other types of data collection are still permitted  For this reason  it s a good idea to check all the apps you ve given permissions to over the years  You can also do this in your settings 
The Reader Center is one way we in the newsroom are trying to connect with you  by highlighting your perspectives and experiences and offering insight into how we work Last weekend  Alyssa Severson  a member of our Reader Center Facebook Group  posed a question to her fellow group members   Are you emotionally affected by the news  Sometimes reading about politics  human rights infringements  war zones  etc  can make me feel anxious or hopeless in a big way  What are some coping strategies you employ  Coincidentally  a story published the same day profiled an Ohio man who has unplugged from news media entirely and describes himself as  bored  yet happy  But our roundup of reactions to the story suggested many readers don t consider such a drastic solution acceptable What s the alternative  Reader Center Facebook Group members shared a mélange of ideas for keeping news generated stress at bay  After you read them  tell us some of the ways you tackle this kind of anxiety Comments below have been condensed and edited for clarity Alyssa Severson  Thailand   Sometimes I ll put a moratorium on a certain subject if it s bringing up really negative feelings   Right now  no Myanmar ethnic cleansing articles   Sometimes realizing how many things are wrong with the world gives me a serious existential crisis  but I think that s just part of life when you care about others Abby Leafe  Newtown  Pa    How do I cope  I detach  And I remind myself that it s a long game  Plus  I m running for office Stacie Birchett  Richmond  Va    Outlander reruns Marjie Gowdy  Callaway  Va    I ve watched La La Land more times than I can count Jeffrey Itell  Vietnam   I read the news in the context that good  news  is happening always  I read The Times to find out when Mount Agung is spewing lava     and not for the magnificent view it provides from Gili Trawangan  The Times reports the news  which includes important events I want to know about  But it doesn t provide me a complete snapshot of the world Shasta Gaughen  Escondido  Ca    When it gets to be too much  I ll delete my sources without reading and take a timeout  Cats help  And ice cream  Lots of ice cream  Here s one of my cats encouraging me to take a break Elaine Tanzman  Sometimes reading disturbing news will inspire me to contribute to organizations that I have forgotten about  For example  after reading about the Neo Nazi riots in Charlottesville  I donated to the Southern Poverty Law Center Daniel Mainz  Brooklyn  NY   I ve appreciated a couple of news sources that combine research and commentary with practical  actionable steps readers can take to make their voices heard  They are DCReport org from Pulitzer winner David Cay Johnston and Lauren Duca s columns in Teen Vogue  Yes  I admit it  Teen Vogue  I read it for the politics Deb Amlen  New York Times crossword columnist   I do regular news fasts and have tried not to wallow on places like Twitter  Also  did you know that the crossword puzzle was originally run in newspapers as an escape from the news pages during World War II  It still allows readers to keep their brains sharp and talk about something other than world events Anna Núñez  Houston  Texas   Dealing with daily barbaric immigration news is part of my job  copywriter for America s Voice   At the end of the day  baking and cooking soothes me and I was grateful for this recent NYT recipe that I highly recommend to calm you  too Fadi BouKaram  Lebanon   Thankfully  I ve been reading Reader s Digest since I was a kid  It might be perceived as cheesy  but the  positive news  in it is a good reminder that the frequency of what s covered by media does not reflect the reality of how the world is Deborah Suraya  New York City   Having dinner together with friends really helps because there is usually a lot of laughter  chatter  etc  I also follow comedians on Twitter Instagram  not just pure news outlets Julia Lansford  from Russia  living in NYC   World can seem a horrible place at a glance  However  NYT has a great project  The Week in Good News  When down from all the negativity  I also remember that dialogue between Frodo and Sam Gamgee in Peter Jackson s  The Lord of the Rings  FRODO  What are we holding on to  Sam SAM  That there s some good in this world  Mr  Frodo  And it s worth fighting for Alexandra Velasco  Queens  NY   I m a democrat and  at the time  I couldn t understand why anyone would vote for Trump  But since he got elected  I ve been fascinated by reasons why people voted for him  and have been trying to find some understanding in their reasoning  Trying to understand people with different viewpoints has helped me cope 
I don t need to tell you that something is wrong with social media You ve probably experienced it yourself  Maybe it s the way you feel while scrolling through your Twitter feed   anxious  twitchy  a little world weary   or your unease when you see a child watching YouTube videos  knowing she s just a few algorithmic nudges away from a rabbit hole filled with lunatic conspiracies and gore  Or maybe it was this month s Facebook privacy scandal  which reminded you that you ve entrusted the most intimate parts of your digital life to a profit maximizing surveillance machine Our growing discomfort with our largest social platforms is reflected in polls  One recently conducted by Axios and SurveyMonkey found that all three of the major social media companies   Facebook  Twitter and Google  which shares a parent company with YouTube   are significantly less popular with Americans than they were five months ago   And Americans might be the lucky ones  Outside the United States  social media is fueling real world violence and empowering autocrats  often with much less oversight  But it would be a mistake to throw up our hands and assume that it has to be this way  The original dream of social media   producing healthy discussions  unlocking new forms of creativity  connecting people to others with similar interests   shouldn t be discarded because of the failures of the current market leaders  And lots of important things still happen on even the most flawed networks  The West Virginia teachers  strike and last weekend s March for Our Lives  for example  were largely organized on Facebook and Twitter The primary problem with today s social networks is that they re already too big  and are trapped inside a market based system that forces them to keep growing  Facebook can t stop monetizing our personal data for the same reason that Starbucks can t stop selling coffee   it s the heart of the enterprise Many of the fixes being proposed involve regulation  The Honest Ads Act  a bill in the Senate  would require greater transparency for online political ads  The European Union s General Data Protection Regulation  which goes into effect in May  aims to give users greater control of their digital information trails But these efforts don t touch the underlying problems  and in fact could make it harder for start ups to compete with the giants If we re really serious about changing how social networks operate  far more radical interventions are required  Here are three possible ways to rescue social media from the market based pressures that got us here In their book  New Power   which comes out next week  Jeremy Heimans and Henry Timms write about the struggle between centralized  top down institutions  which represent  old power   and decentralized  bottom up movements  which represent  new power  Facebook  they write  is an example of a new power institution that serves old power interests  It harvests the creative output of billions of people and turns it into a giant  centralized enterprise  with most users sharing none of the economic value they create and getting no say in the platform s governance Instead  the authors ask  what if a social network was truly run by its users  If you re contributing economic value to something of this much social consequence  you should share in the value you re creating   Mr  Heimans told me Nathan Schneider  a professor of media studies at the University of Colorado  had a similar idea in 2016  when he proposed that Twitter users band together to buy the platform from its shareholders and convert it into a user run collective  similar to the way a local credit union is run  People who made valuable contributions to the network  such as employees and power users  would receive bigger stakes and more voting power  And users would have a seat at the table for major decisions about the platform s operations It s exceedingly unlikely that Mark Zuckerberg  who has fought hard to keep control of Facebook  will ever convert the company into a user owned and run collective  But Mr  Schneider believes that giving more control to responsible users could help restore trust in the network  and signal the kind of values Mr  Zuckerberg says he wants Facebook to represent  He could show that he takes democracy seriously enough to start with his own baby   Mr  Schneider said Another radical approach would be to make social networks work more like email   so that independent apps could seamlessly work together with one another  across a common protocol Instead of one big Facebook  a federated social network would look like clusters of independent nodes   Mombook and Athletebook and Gamerbook   all of which could be plugged into the umbrella network when it made sense  Rather than requiring a one size fits all set of policies that apply to billions of users  these nodes could be designed to reflect users  priorities   A network for privacy hawks and one for open sharing maximalists could have different data retention rules  and a network for L G B T  users and one for evangelical pastors could have different hate speech rules   If a node became too toxic  it could be removed without shutting down the entire network  Email is the most resilient social network on the internet   Mr  Schneider said   and the thing that allows it to adapt is that it s an open protocol  and people build apps on top of it  and we evolve how we use it  Versions of this kind of network already exist  Mastodon  a decentralized Twitter like social network  has gotten more than a million registered users since its debut in 2016  And various social networks based on the blockchain   the ledger system that underlies virtual currencies like Bitcoin   have sprung up in recent months To be sure  decentralized networks have their own problems  They re messy to administer  and they can still be gamed by bad actors  They can also fall prey to the same kind of privacy issues that Facebook is being criticized for   In fact  part of the reason users are angry at Facebook right now is that the company s data infrastructure was too open  and made it overly simple for third party app developers to take user information outside Facebook  None of this is a panacea  But experimenting with more decentralized models could give social media users a sense that platforms represented their interests  rather than those of a faceless corporation A single friend of mine once remarked that the major difference among dating apps like OKCupid  Tinder and Bumble wasn t the way they were designed or the companies behind them   it was how long they had existed New apps  she said  were more likely to attract interesting and smart people who were actually looking for dates  Older apps  by contrast  were eventually overrun with creeps and predators  no matter how well built they were A similar theory might apply to social networks  Facebook  Twitter  YouTube  Instagram and Snapchat all had plenty of issues in their early years  but they were by and large cleaner  with fewer types of exploitation and malicious behavior  Today  the enormous size and influence of these platforms have made them irresistible honey pots for bad actors  and many of our  social graphs    Facebook s term for the webs of digital connections we create   are clogged with years  worth of clutter In a blog post last year  the venture capitalist Hunter Walk proposed an interesting idea  a legally mandated  start over  button that  when pressed  would allow users of social networks to delete all their data  clear out their feeds and friend lists  and begin with a fresh account I d go even further  and suggest that social networks give their users an automatic  self cleaning  option  which would regularly clear their profiles of apps they no longer used  friendships and followers they no longer interacted with  and data they no longer needed to store  If these tools were enabled  users would need to take affirmative action if they didn t want their information to disappear after a certain number of months or years Making social graphs temporary  rather than preserving them forever by default  would undoubtedly be bad for most social networks  business models  But it could create new and healthy norms around privacy and data hygiene  and it would keep problems from piling up as networks get older and more crowded  It might even recapture some of the magic of the original social networks  when things were fresh and fascinating  and not quite so scary 
A parade of regulators  politicians and law enforcement officials demanded to know more about Facebook s privacy practices on Monday  as the fallout from the company s relationship with a political data firm continued to spread Early in the day  the Federal Trade Commission confirmed reports that it was investigating how Facebook handles information about its users Soon after  Senator Charles E  Grassley  Republican of Iowa and chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee  invited Mark Zuckerberg  Facebook s chief executive  to testify about privacy standards next month  He also extended invitations to Google s chief executive  Sundar Pichai  and Twitter s chief executive  Jack Dorsey And a group of 37 attorneys general sent Mr  Zuckerberg a letter asking for details about Facebook s privacy safeguards But one group of people interested in Facebook   investors   had a muted reaction to the growing regulatory threat  Shares of Facebook fell sharply after the F T C  confirmed its investigation but ended the day up 0 4 percent as overall trading on Wall Street recovered from a big drop last week The federal investigation and threats followed recent news that the data collection firm Cambridge Analytica  which worked on the 2016 Trump presidential campaign  gained access to the personal data of more than 50 million Facebook users The F T C  said it planned to determine whether the social media giant had violated a consent decree it signed in 2011 to protect users  privacy The decree required Facebook to notify and receive explicit permission from users before sharing their personal information beyond the limits dictated by their privacy settings  Each violation of the agreement  which the agency reached with Facebook as part of a settlement over third party apps  carries a penalty of up to  40 000 a day The agency s acknowledgment of its investigation helped push Facebook s stock down as much as 6 5 percent on Monday morning before it recovered  Facebook said last week that it was anticipating an inquiry by the agency The F T C  said in a statement on Monday that it  takes very seriously recent press reports raising substantial concerns about the privacy practices of Facebook  Lawmakers have repeatedly called for Mr  Zuckerberg to appear in hearings on Capitol Hill  Last week  the Republican and Democratic leaders of the House and Senate commerce committees formally invited him to testify  I m sure this is much bigger than Cambridge Analytica  and I m sure there are other Cambridge Analyticas out there   Senator John Kennedy  Republican from Louisiana  said in an interview   Facebook isn t just a company  It is so powerful it is like a country  Some lawmakers  such as Senator Richard Blumenthal  Democrat from Connecticut  asked the F T C  to look into whether Facebook should pay damages to users  The sphere of scrutiny must be broader than just the consent decree   he said in a statement   There is no excuse for delay  Cambridge Analytica is facing intense criticism  too  On Monday  Common Cause  a government watchdog group in Washington  filed complaints seeking federal investigations into allegations that the company violated federal election law In an article that detailed how Cambridge Analytica obtained information about millions of Facebook users  The New York Times reported this month that employees of the data research firm with European or Canadian citizenship had worked extensively for its American clients during the 2014 and 2016 elections  despite a warning from its own election lawyer The employees worked on polling  message development  and the designing of target audiences for digital ads and fund raising appeals The company said the work was permissible because none of the foreign employees had  strategic  or  operational  roles  But former employees contradicted that account  suggesting that the work violated laws in the United States that strictly limit what non Americans can do for American political campaigns Common Cause filed one complaint with the Justice Department  which has authority to investigate  knowing and willful  violations of campaign law  The group also filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission  which has day to day jurisdiction over enforcing election rules  It defies belief that even after their own attorney warned them that they would be violating the prohibition on performing certain election related activities in U S  elections that they did so anyway   said Paul S  Ryan  Common Cause s vice president for policy and litigation In the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco  lawyers appealed two lawsuits that challenged the social media company s privacy and user data policies  One lawsuit claims that Facebook violates the Electronic Communications Privacy Act  Wiretap Act  and state law equivalents because of the way it monitors its users on and off the platform The second suit claims that Facebook has been capturing and selling the details of users  browsing of third party health sites  Any site with a Facebook  like  button  including those of medical institutions such as the American Cancer Society and the American Society of Clinical Oncology  could be used to track users as they browsed outside Facebook  according to the lawsuit Facebook also has been targeted by several shareholder lawsuits since the reports detailing Cambridge Analytica s use of Facebook user information Many users have threatened to deactivate or delete their accounts to protest Facebook s stewardship of their personal data  The  deletefacebook campaign  as it has been called  has even received support from a creator of WhatsApp  one of Facebook s most popular services  who sold his company to the social media giant for  19 billion in 2014  Elon Musk  the chief executive of SpaceX and Tesla  removed the Facebook pages of both companies on Friday While the Cambridge Analytica revelations have renewed regulatory interest in Facebook in the United States  pressure on the company in other countries has been building for years The company has been the subject of several privacy investigations and charges by European regulators  And Europe has approved a new privacy law  which takes effect in May  that will give users of Facebook  Google and other internet services more control over how their data is collected and what Silicon Valley companies know about them 
  Want to get this briefing by email  Here s the sign up  Good morning Here s what you need to know   Mark Zuckerberg  the social media giant s chief executive  publicly addressed the crisis facing his company  five days after reports about the misuse of data from 50 million of its users  We also made mistakes  there s more to do  and we need to step up and do it   he wrote in a statement outlining the steps Facebook would take to better protect users  information  He also spoke to The Times about his plans for change Given that the gathering of user data is fundamental to the company s operations  lawmakers and researchers were unimpressed by Mr  Zuckerberg s mea culpa   He avoided the big issue  which is that for many years  Facebook was basically giving away user data like it was handing out candy   a Columbia University researcher said   Disillusioned Facebook users  have been leaving the service  Want to delete your account  You can try   A pair of pink construction gloves led to Mark Anthony Conditt  who the police say was responsible for a string of bombings in the Texas capital On Wednesday  Mr  Conditt  a 23 year old from the Austin suburbs with no criminal record  detonated one of his homemade devices and killed himself before he could be apprehended  Here s what we know about him   The authorities are now trying to determine a motive  They re being helped by a 25 minute confession the suspect left on his phone   President Trump has said the country is an  economic enemy  of the U S  that has  taken advantage of us like nobody in history  Today  he plans to announce tariffs on at least  50 billion of annual Chinese imports and to impose other penalties in response to the theft of technology and trade secrets  Previously announced tariffs on steel and aluminum imports  which will also affect China  go into effect on Friday China s staggering economic growth has indeed been propelled by unfair trade practices  but experts worry that the president s go it alone approach undermines the potential for collective action   On Wednesday  Mr  Trump appeared to endorse a  1 3 trillion spending deal reached by Congress  Lawmakers must approve the bill by midnight Friday to avoid a government shutdown   President s Trump s lead lawyer for the special counsel investigation resigned today  according to two people briefed on the matter The lawyer  John Dowd  who took over the president s legal team last summer  had considered leaving several times and ultimately concluded that Mr  Trump was increasingly ignoring his advice  one of the

Eisenstadt v  Baird that it s unconstitutional for a state to deny unmarried people access to contraception The court had ruled earlier  in 1965  that state bans on contraceptives for married couples violated their privacy rights  But a few states still restricted access for single people Bill Baird  an activist  violated one such law in Massachusetts  He appealed his conviction to the Supreme Court  which struck down the law Justice William Brennan held that the law violated the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment because it discriminated between married and unmarried people The case became an important precedent for landmark rulings by the Supreme Court  including the 1973 decision in Roe v  Wade that recognized abortion rights  and  more recently  the 2015 decision guaranteeing a right to same sex marriage A movie about Mr  Baird s case is in development Mr  Baird has continued working as an activist  but his legacy is complicated by what The Times described in

Good morning  Want to get California Today by email  Here s the sign up  More than 10 years ago  Arnold Schwarzenegger  then the Republican governor of California  told an audience of conservative leaders that the California Republican Party had moved too far to the right and was  dying at the box office   How right I was   Mr  Schwarzenegger said in a rare return public appearance on Wednesday   The party was going down and down and down  Today we are the Titanic after it hit the iceberg   but before the last bit of the ship submerged  Mr  Schwarzenegger was speaking at a youth center in East Los Angeles marking the start of an organization of moderate California Republicans trying to move the way out of power state party to the center   and back  organizers said  into being a player in state governance  The organization is called New Way California and was put together by Assemblyman Chad Mayes  who was ousted as the Republican minority leader after voting with Democrats on extending the cap and trade automobile emission program  We seek to shed the stereotype of the intolerant Republican Party that serves only the rich and big business   Mr  Mayes said Mr  Schwarzenegger was not the only Republican firepower on stage  John Kasich  the governor of Ohio  who is considering challenging President Trump for the Republican nomination in 2020  was also on hand In Sacramento  the former governor   and occasional actor   broke with national Republicans  at least of today  when he championed environmental protection efforts  including stringent emission controls  In sentiments also reflected by Mr  Kasich and Mr  Mayes  Mr  Schwarzenegger said the Republican Party had to be  environmentally progressive  socially liberal and fiscally conservative  in order to be competitive  Our party is giving them Twitter fights instead of answers   Mr  Schwarzenegger said   And it is sinking us  It is time to return to the issues   The politics of division and anger and resentment can drive a strong base to the polls  yes   he said   But it is tearing our country apart at the seams  And nothing is getting done   Please note  We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers    Mark Zuckerberg on whether he s concerned about Facebook users deleting their accounts   I think it s a clear signal that this is a major trust issue for people  and I understand that  And whether people delete their app over it or just don t feel good about using Facebook  that s a big issue that I think we have a responsibility to rectify   Full interview   You can quit Facebook if you simply find no joy in it  But if you re looking to leave for philosophical reasons concerning privacy  it s a futile effort  You may be better

Revelations that a voter profiling company that worked Donald J  Trump s presidential campaign harvested private information from 50 million Facebook profiles have many people wondering  What  if anything  can they do to protect their data connected to the social network Here s the harsh truth  Not much  short of ceasing to browse the web entirely or deleting your Facebook account Yet there are some best practices you can employ to help safeguard your data  such as installing software to block web tracking technologies and carefully vetting the apps that you use on Facebook But it also helps to understand what exactly happened with those 50 million profiles in order to determine how you can better protect your data  Here s what you need to know An academic researcher at Cambridge University built an app called thisisyourdigitallife  which offered to pay Facebook users to take a personality test and agree to share that data for academic use  About 270 000 people participated in the study   enough to extract information on tens of millions of Facebooks users How did Cambridge Analytica get data on 50 million people when only 270 000 people had agreed to hand over their information to a third party  Facebook said people who downloaded the app gave consent for the app to collect limited information about their friends whose privacy settings were set to allow it That information was eventually paid for by Cambridge Analytica  the voter profiling company that worked with the Trump campaign There is a multipronged approach you can take to protect yourself from data harvesting apps and programs  That includes tools you can install in your browser and settings you can tweak on Facebook  Here s a run down of what you should do   Audit your Facebook apps  If you used Facebook to sign in to a third party website  game or app  those services may continue to access your personal data  On Facebook  go to the settings page and click on the Apps tab to see which apps are connected to your account  From there  you can take a closer look at the permissions you granted to each app to see what information you are sharing  Remove any apps that you find suspicious or no longer use   Facebook has also made some changes to prevent the gathering of detailed information of friends of users  On the App Settings page there is another setting called Apps Others Use  This is where you choose which details are shared about you when your friends use apps  Make sure to uncheck all the boxes if you don t want any of your information  like your birthday or hometown  accessed by your friends  apps   Audit your Facebook privacy settings  If you are concerned about what details apps can see about you and your Facebook friends  now is a good time to check your privacy settings and minimize the information you share publicly  For example  you can make sure that only your friends can see your Facebook posts  or that only you can see your friends list   Read privacy policies  When you sign up for a new app or web tool  the company typically asks you to agree to its terms of service  Make it a habit to peruse the terms and pay particular attention to the privacy policy  If you see language that suggests your data could be shared in a way that makes you uncomfortable  don t use the program   Install a tracker blocker  There are add ons that you can install in your browser that try to block trackers embedded on websites  But be aware that in some cases  they will make parts of websites work improperly  In our tests  Disconnect and Privacy Badger were useful tools for blocking trackers on Google s Chrome browser Here s a primer on how tracking works  to give you a sense of why blockers are important  When you engage with an app on Facebook  it may plant a tracker in your web browser  like a cookie  that collects information from you  Even when you close out of the app  the tracker can continue to follow your activities  like the other sites you visit or the people you interact with through status updates  according to Michael Priem  chief executive of Modern Impact  an advertising firm in Minneapolis  It doesn t go away after you ve stopped looking at the ad   he said   Install an ad blocker  Another way to block trackers is to prevent ads from loading altogether  Ad blockers are also add ons that you can install for your browser on your mobile device or computer  Mobile ads are fully functioning programs  and they sometimes include malware that harvest some of your data  Even the largest websites do not have tight control over the ads that appear on their sites   and sometimes malicious code can appear inside their ad networks  A popular ad blocker among security researchers is uBlock Origin   Clear your browsing data  Periodically  you can clear your cookies and browsing history  Apple  Google and Microsoft have published instructions on how to clear data for their browsers Safari  Chrome and Internet Explorer  That will temporarily delete cookies and trackers  though they will probably reappear over time   Be wary of unknown brands  Even if you read the privacy policies  you still may have to take them with a grain of salt  In the case of the thisisyourdigitallife app  the fine print said the information would be collected for academic use  not commercial purposes  So think twice before sharing information with unfamiliar companies or organizations   Then again  the researcher came from Cambridge University  one of the world s top schools   so who can you really trust  
Good Wednesday  Here s what we re watching   Mark Zuckerberg has broken his silence on the Cambridge Analytica crisis   Why driverless cars are essential to Uber s future   Jerome Powell s first Federal Reserve meeting as chairman   Pete Peterson  the co founder of Blackstone and a former chairman of Lehman Brothers  has died   Facebook and other tech companies might need a new privacy regulator   How companies are pressing for tariff exemptions Get this in your inbox each morning  Sign up here Facebook s chief executive posted a statement on his Facebook page  saying he was taking action to prevent people s data on the social network from being misused  We have a responsibility to protect your data  and if we can t then we don t deserve to serve you   Mr  Zuckerberg wrote   I ve been working to understand exactly what happened and how to make sure this doesn t happen again  Here are the steps the company is taking to address the issue    We will investigate all apps that had access to large amounts of information before we changed our platform to dramatically reduce data access in 2014  and we will conduct a full audit of any app with suspicious activity     We will restrict developers  data access even further to prevent other kinds of abuse     We want to make sure you understand which apps you ve allowed to access your data  In the next month  we will show everyone a tool at the top of your News Feed with the apps you ve used and an easy way to revoke those apps  permissions to your data  Mr  Zuckerberg had drawn criticism for his response to how Cambridge Analytica improperly obtained data on 50 million Facebook users  In the days since the news first broke this weekend  he had not commented publicly on the crisis That contrasts with how other tech chief executives have addressed crises at their firms Kevin Roose and Sheera Frenkel of the NYT report So why did it take so long for Mr  Zuckerberg to respond  Kate Losse  an early Facebook employee and Mr  Zuckerberg s former speechwriter  told the NYT   My guess is that what is giving Zuckerberg pause at this point is the question of how to acknowledge and explain this state of affairs while at the same time mitigating the concerns that will come from people finally understanding how this all worked  Peter Eavis s take  There was something missing from Mark Zuckerberg s response   a full explanation of why Facebook took so long to disclose the misuse of its data  As Mr  Zuckerberg noted  Facebook found out in 2015 that Aleksandr Kogan had violated company policies by sharing user data with Cambridge Analytica  Facebook users might ask why the abuse wasn t disclosed at the time  Often it has taken pressure from outsiders to get Facebook to reveal abuses of its network  An alternative approach would have been for Facebook to proactively disclose as much information as possible about the wrongdoing  Facebook users would most likely welcome a strong commitment from Mr  Zuckerberg to do just that The Federal Reserve  as widely expected  raised interest rates on Wednesday by a quarter of a percentage point  The bigger questions were about the strength of the economy and pace of future rate increases On those matters  the Federal Reserve has expressed more confidence in the strength of the economy Dot plot  Fed officials signaled they would raise rates at a quicker pace over the next three years  Policymakers now expect to hike rates three times this year  three times in 2019 and twice in 2020  At its December meeting  policymakers expected three rate hikes this year  but just two in 2019 Economic projections  Officials raised their median estimates for economic growth this year to 2 7 percent  up from 2 5 percent in December  Fed policymakers also expect inflation to run above 2 percent by 2019 and 2020 Mr  Powell s news conference  The new Fed chairman expressed optimism about the current economic picture and said officials were trying to strike a balance between raising rates too slowly or too quickly   We re trying to take that middle ground  Mr  Powell left the door open to more or fewer than three increases this year  depending on economic conditions   Like any set of forecasts  those forecasts will change over time   he said   It could change up  It could change down On inflation  he added   There is no sense in the data that we re on the cusp of an acceleration of inflation  We have seen moderate increases in wages and price inflation  And we seem to be seeing more of that  The answer has to do with car ownership  For years  Uber and its rivals have promoted the idea that people living in urban areas will turn to Uber to get to and from work and to run errands rather than buy a car If Uber can become an alternative to car ownership  that would greatly increase its potential market A study last year from the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute  Texas A M Transportation Institute  and Columbia University suggested that people might make the switch But for people give up their cars  the cost of using Uber would most likely have to fall far below current levels  The need for this drop in costs came up when Dara Khosrowshahi  the C E O  of Uber  recently sat down for an interview with David Solomon  president and C O O  of Goldman Sachs Here s the write up of the autonomous car portion of their conversation in a recent Goldman note to clients The pedestrian fatality in Arizona is perhaps Dara Khosrowshahi s first major test as Uber s C E O   leaving him with a difficult choice  keep

For much of the past week  Facebook has been embroiled in a controversy involving Cambridge Analytica  a political consulting firm with ties to Donald J  Trump s 2016 presidential campaign  and how the firm improperly obtained and exploited personal data from 50 million Facebook users On Wednesday  following widespread questions about his whereabouts  Mark Zuckerberg  the chief executive of Facebook  spoke with two New York Times reporters  Sheera Frenkel and Kevin Roose  about the controversy and the steps he was taking to make the social network less prone to abuse Below is a transcript of the conversation  edited for length and clarity Sheera Frenkel  Did it come as a surprise to you  the user response to the news that Cambridge Analytica had accessed this trove of data Mark Zuckerberg  Privacy issues have always been incredibly important to people  One of our biggest responsibilities is to protect data  If you think about what our services are  at their most basic level  you put some content into a service  whether it s a photo or a video or a text message   whether it s Facebook or WhatsApp or Instagram   and you re trusting that that content is going to be shared with the people you want to share it with  Whenever there s an issue where someone s data gets passed to someone who the rules of the system shouldn t have allowed it to  that s rightfully a big issue and deserves to be a big uproar Frenkel  It took quite a few days for your response to come out  Is that because you were weighing these three action points that you noted in your post Zuckerberg  The first thing is  I really wanted to make sure we had a full and accurate understanding of everything that happened  I know that there was a lot of pressure to speak sooner  but my assessment was that it was more important that what we said was fully accurate The second thing is  the most important thing is that we fix this system so that issues like this don t happen again  It s not like there aren t going to be other different kind of things we ll also have to fix  But when there s a certain problem  we have a responsibility to at least make sure we resolve that problem So the actions here that we re going to do involve first  dramatically reducing the amount of data that developers have access to  so that apps and developers can t do what Kogan did here  The most important actions there we actually took three or four years ago  in 2014  But when we examined the systems this week  there were certainly other things we felt we should lock down  too  So we re going ahead and doing that Even if you solve the problem going forward  there s still this issue of  Are there other Cambridge Analyticas out there  or other Kogans who  when the platform worked a certain way in the past  were there apps which could have gotten access to more information  and potentially sold it without us knowing  or done something that violated people s trust  We also need to make sure we get that under control  That s why we spent a lot of time figuring out  O K  here s what it s going to take to do a full investigation of every app that got access to a large amount of information before we changed the platform policies to dramatically reduce the data access that developers had  For any app that we uncover that has any suspicious activity  we re going to go do a full forensic audit  and make sure we have the capacity to do that  to make sure that other developers aren t doing what Kogan did here The third thing is  it s really important that people know what apps they ve authorized  A lot of people have been on Facebook now for five or 10 years  and sometimes you signed into an app a long time ago and you may have forgotten about that  So one of the steps we re taking is making it so apps can no longer access data after you haven t used them for three months But it s also just really important to put in front of people a tool of  here are all the apps you ve connected to and authorized  here s an easy way to deauthorize them  to revoke their permission to get access to your activity Kevin Roose  Is Facebook planning to notify the 50 million users whose data was shared with Cambridge Analytica Zuckerberg  Yes  We re going to tell anyone whose data may have been shared Now  there s a question of whether we have the exact record in our systems today of who your friends were on that day when there was access three and a half or four years ago  so we re going to be conservative on that and try to tell anyone whose data may have been affected  even if we don t know for certain that they were  It s likely that we ll build a tool like we did with the Russian misinformation investigation  that anyone can go to it and see if their data was affected by this Roose  Do you have a preliminary estimate of how many apps you ll be investigating Zuckerberg  It will be in the thousands Frenkel  Were those app developers notified that you ll be investigating this yet Zuckerberg  Just when I posted  And we ll be reaching out in the near term Frenkel  Are you going to be hiring people to help conduct those investigations Zuckerberg  Yes  I would imagine we re going to have to grow the team to work on this Roose  You mentioned a contract that developers will have to sign in order to ask anyone for access to broader profile information  What will be the terms of that contract  and what will be the penalties for violating it Zuckerberg  So  the important thing there is that it s a high touch process  The specific point we were trying to make is that it s not going to be some terms of service that a developer can sign up for just on their computer when developing something  I guess technically  that would be a contract as well The point of what we re trying to do here is to create a situation where we have a real person to person relationship with any developer who is asking for the most sensitive data  That doesn t mean that   if you re a developer and you want to put Facebook Login on your website  you can do that  If you want to get access to ask people for their religious affiliation  or their sexual orientation  for data that could be very sensitive  we want to make sure we have a clear relationship with those people Frenkel  We understood that Cambridge Analytica had reached out to Facebook and asked that its ban on the platform be reconsidered  Are you giving any thought to allowing Cambridge Analytica back in Zuckerberg  The first thing we need to do is conduct this full forensic audit of the firm  that they don t have any people s data from our community and that they ve deleted anything  including derivative data  that they might have  We re working with the regulator in the U K  on this  so our forensic audit was actually paused in the near term to cede the way for the ICO there to do their own government investigation  We re certainly not going to consider letting them back onto the platform until we have full confirmation that there s no wrongdoing here Roose  There were reports as far back as 2015 that Cambridge Analytica had access to this data set  Why didn t you suspend them then Zuckerberg  So  we actually heard  I think it was at the end of 2015   some journalists from The Guardian reached out to us and told us what you just said  And it was not just about Cambridge Analytica  it was about this developer  Aleksandr Kogan  who had shared data with them We took action immediately at that point  We banned Kogan s app from the platform  we demanded that Kogan and Cambridge Analytica and a couple other parties that Kogan had shared the data with would legally certify that they didn t have the data  and weren t using it in any of their operations  They gave us that formal certification  At the time  they told us they never had gotten access to raw Facebook data  so we made that decision Frenkel  In retrospect  do you wish you had demanded proof that the data had been deleted Zuckerberg  Yes  They gave us a formal and legal certification  and it seems at this point that that was false Again  we haven t done our full investigation and audit yet so I can t say definitively that they actually have data  I ve just read all the same reports that you have  including in The New York Times  that says that journalists have seen evidence that they have the data  which is a strong enough signal for us to go on  and take action here That s the basic driver behind us now needing to go and do a full investigation into any app that had access to a large amount of data before we locked down the platform policies in 2014  Just having folks tell us that they were using the data correctly  I think  does not satisfy our responsibility to our community to protect their data Frenkel  Are you actively looking at some of these dark web data brokers that have been in news reports recently  that say that other independent researchers are potentially trading in this data Zuckerberg  Yes  we re investigating that too Roose  Are you worried about the  DeleteFacebook campaign that s been going around  Have you seen meaningful numbers of people deleting their accounts  and are you worried that will be a trend Zuckerberg  I don t think we ve seen a meaningful number of people act on that  but  you know  it s not good  I think it s a clear signal that this is a major trust issue for people  and I understand that  And whether people delete their app over it or just don t feel good about using Facebook  that s a big issue that I think we have a responsibility to rectify Frenkel  We re now heading into the 2018 midterms  Could you speak about what Facebook is going to do ahead of the 2018 midterms to make people feel more confident that the platform won t be used this way again Zuckerberg  This is an incredibly important point  There s no doubt that in 2016  there were a number of issues including foreign interference and false news that we did not have as much of a handle on as we feel a responsibility to for our community Now  the good news here is that these problems aren t necessarily rocket science  They re hard  but they re things that if you invest and work on making it harder for adversaries to do what they re trying to do  you can really reduce the amount of false news  make it harder for foreign governments to interfere One of the things that gives me confidence is that we ve seen a number of elections at this point where this has gone a lot better  In the months after the 2016 election  there was the French election  The new A I  tools we built after the 2016 elections found  I think  more than 30 000 fake accounts that we believe were linked to Russian sources who were trying to do the same kind of tactics they did in the U S  in the 2016 election  We were able to disable them and prevent that from happening on a large scale in France In last year  in 2017 with the special election in Alabama  we deployed some new A I  tools to identify fake accounts and false news  and we found a significant number of Macedonian accounts that were trying to spread false news  and were able to eliminate those  And that  actually  is something I haven t talked about publicly before  so you re the first people I m telling about that I feel a lot better about the systems now  At the same time  I think Russia and other governments are going to get more sophisticated in what they do  too  So we need to make sure that we up our game  This is a massive focus for us to make sure we re dialed in for not only the 2018 elections in the U S   but the Indian elections  the Brazilian elections  and a number of other elections that are going on this year that are really important Frenkel  The Times reported that  Facebook chief security officer Alex  Stamos will be leaving toward the end of this year  Is there a broader plan for how Facebook is going to structure security on its platform ahead of all these important elections Zuckerberg  Sure  One of the important things we ve done is  we want to unify all of our security efforts  And you reported on a reorg around Alex Stamos  and I ll say something about him in a second  He s been a very valuable contributor here and was a really central figure in helping us identify the foreign interference with Russia  And I think he has done very good work  and I m hopeful he ll be engaged for a while here on that One of the big things we needed to do is coordinate our efforts a lot better across the whole company  It s not all A I   right  There s certainly a lot that A I  can do  we can train classifiers to identify content  but most of what we do is identify things that people should look at  So we re going to double the amount of people working on security this year  We ll have more than 20 000 people working on security and community operations by the end of the year  I think we have about 15 000 now  So it s really the technical systems we have working with the people in our operations functions that make the biggest deal The last thing I d add on this  Take things like false news  You know  a lot of it is really spam  if you think about it  It s the same people who might have been sending you Viagra emails in the  90s  now they re trying to come up with sensational content and push it into Facebook and other apps in order to get you to click on it and see ads  There are some pretty basic policy decisions we ve made  like O K   if you re anywhere close to being a fake news site  you can t put Facebook ads on your site  right  So then suddenly  it becomes harder for them to make money  If you make it hard enough for them to make money  they just kind of go and do something else Roose  Is the basic economic model of Facebook  in which users provide data that Facebook uses to help advertisers and developers to better target potential customers and users   do you feel like that works  given what we now know about the risks Zuckerberg  Yeah  so this is a really important question  The thing about the ad model that is really important that aligns with our mission is that   our mission is to build a community for everyone in the world and to bring the world closer together  And a really important part of that is making a service that people can afford  A lot of the people  once you get past the first billion people  can t afford to pay a lot  Therefore  having it be free and have a business model that is ad supported ends up being really important and aligned Now  over time  might there be ways for people who can afford it to pay a different way  That s certainly something we ve thought about over time  But I don t think the ad model is going to go away  because I think fundamentally  it s important to have a service like this that everyone in the world can use  and the only way to do that is to have it be very cheap or free Roose  Adam Mosseri  Facebook s head of News Feed  recently said he had lost some sleep over Facebook s role in the violence in Myanmar  You ve said you re  outraged  about what happened with Cambridge Analytica  but when you think about the many things that are happening with Facebook all over the world  are you losing any sleep  Do you feel any guilt about the role Facebook is playing in the world Zuckerberg  That s a good question  I think  you know  we re doing something here which is unprecedented  in terms of building a community for people all over the world to be able to share what matters to them  and connect across boundaries  I think what we re seeing is  there are new challenges that I don t think anyone had anticipated before If you had asked me  when I got started with Facebook  if one of the central things I d need to work on now is preventing governments from interfering in each other s elections  there s no way I thought that s what I d be doing  if we talked in 2004 in my dorm room I don t know that it s possible to know every issue that you re going to face down the road  But we have a real responsibility to take all these issues seriously as they come up  and work with experts and people around the world to make sure we solve them  and do a good job for our community It s certainly true that  over the course of Facebook  I ve made all kinds of different mistakes  whether that s technical mistakes or business mistakes or hiring mistakes  We ve launched product after product that didn t work  I spend most of my time looking forward  trying to figure out how to solve the issues that people are having today  because I think that s what people in our community would want 
WASHINGTON   The political action committee founded by John R  Bolton  President Trump s incoming national security adviser  was one of the earliest customers of Cambridge Analytica  which it hired specifically to develop psychological profiles of voters with data harvested from tens of millions of Facebook profiles  according to former Cambridge employees and company documents Mr  Bolton s political committee  known as The John Bolton Super PAC  first hired Cambridge in August 2014  months after the political data firm was founded and while it was still harvesting the Facebook data In the two years that followed  Mr  Bolton s super PAC spent nearly  1 2 million primarily for  survey research   which is a term that campaigns use for polling  according to campaign finance records But the contract between the political action committee and Cambridge  a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times  offers more detail on just what Mr  Bolton was buying  The contract broadly describes the services to be delivered by Cambridge as  behavioral microtargeting with psychographic messaging  To do that work  Cambridge used Facebook data  according to the documents and two former employees familiar with the work  The data and modeling Bolton s PAC received was derived from the Facebook data   said Christopher Wylie  a data expert who was part of the team that founded Cambridge Analytica   We definitely told them about how we were doing it  We talked about it in conference calls  in meetings  Cambridge Analytica  which rose to prominence through its work with Mr  Trump s 2016 election campaign  has found itself confronting a deepening crisis since reports this past weekend in The New York Times and The Observer of London that the firm had harvested the data from more than 50 million Facebook profiles in its bid to develop techniques for predicting the behavior of individual American voters Cambridge s so called psychographic modeling techniques  which were built in part with the data harvested from Facebook  underpinned its work for Mr  Trump s campaign in 2016  setting off a furious   and still unsettled   debate about whether the firm s technology worked  The same techniques were also the focus of its work for Mr  Bolton s super PAC  The Bolton PAC was obsessed with how America was becoming limp wristed and spineless and it wanted research and messaging for national security issues   Mr  Wylie said  That really meant making people more militaristic in their worldview   he added   That s what they said they wanted  anyway  Using the psychographic models  Cambridge helped design concepts for advertisements for candidates supported by Mr  Bolton s PAC  including the 2014 campaign of Thom Tillis  the Republican senator from North Carolina  according to Mr  Wylie and another former employee  who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid being dragged into the investigations that now appear to be engulfing Cambridge One advertisement  a video that was posted on YouTube  was aimed at people who scored high for conscientiousness  and were thought to respect hard work and experience  It emphasized Mr  Bolton s time working for Ronald Reagan and how Mr  Tillis embodied the spirit and political ethos of the late president Beyond their conservative politics  Mr  Trump  Mr  Bolton and Cambridge Analytica all share a patron   the Mercer family of Long Island  whose patriarch  Robert L  Mercer  made a fortune at the helm of a top yielding hedge fund Cambridge Analytica  which grew out of the London based SCL Group  was founded in 2014 with a  15 million investment from Mr  Mercer  whose daughter Rebekah sits on the firm s board of directors  Stephen K  Bannon was also a co founder At the same time  Mr  Mercer was financially supporting Mr  Bolton s PAC  donating  5 million between April 2014 and September 2016  according to Federal Election Commission filings  The Mercers also backed Mr  Trump in the presidential election The Mercer family has not publicly commented since the reports about the misuse of Facebook data by Cambridge first surfaced in The Times and The Observer The reports have prompted calls from lawmakers in Britain and the United States for renewed scrutiny of Facebook  and at least two American state prosecutors have said they are looking into the misuse of data by Cambridge Analytica The company also suspended its chief executive  Alexander Nix  after a television broadcast this week in which he was recorded suggesting that the company had used seduction and bribery to entrap politicians and influence foreign elections But it is the harvesting of Facebook data that has cast the harshest spotlight on Cambridge  and Mr  Bolton s experience with the company appears to have provided a model for how it sold itself to future political campaigns  including Mr  Trump s The firm took the psychographic profiles it was building off the Facebook data at the time and combined them with voter databases and other sets of data  Staff from SCL s elections division  which through a convoluted corporate structure was interchangeable with Cambridge  discussed what they were doing at a meeting in July 2014 with another contractor for the Bolton PAC  according to an agenda of the meeting obtained by The Times The profiles would be used to  identify the personality traits of individuals  in states to be targeted by the Bolton PAC  said the agenda  which was prepared for SCL and Cambridge staff   Individuals can be targeted with the right message   it said The agenda also included a line  in boldfaced text  that said SCL wanted to use voter contact lists available to Bolton s campaign to direct people  toward the FB app   Cambridge  working through an outside researcher  used a Facebook app to harvest data from the social network s profiles  The app claimed to be collecting data for academic research  and users were not aware of its true purpose Months later  the relationship between Cambridge and the Bolton PAC had grown so close that the firm was writing up talking points for Mr  Bolton  In an email dated Oct  1  2014  Cambridge staff outlined a few sentences that Mr  Bolton could use to describe the work the new firm was doing for his super PAC  It s not just about how much you spend  It s also about how smart you spend   the email advised Mr  Bolton to say  One way we re doing that is by enlisting an outside firm    Cambridge Analytica    to provide deepdive research into who makes up our audience of target voters   it continued   We are producing ads specifically designed for voters of a certain personality and demographic profile  So if you re a young woman in New Hampshire with a specific kind of personality and a particular set of issues that you care about  our research allows us to connect with that voter in a way that truly resonates with her  The subject line of the email   Did Bannon come back to you on this  
LONDON   The whistle blower Christopher Wylie held a roomful of British lawmakers rapt for three and a half hours on Tuesday  like a pink haired  nose ringed oracle sent from the future to explain data In testimony to the House of Commons  select committee on culture  Mr  Wylie  a 28 year old Canadian  described the inner workings of SCL  a political consultancy that gave its clients access to a vast collection of personal information harvested from Facebook In one of the longest sessions in recent memory  Mr  Wylie made a number of jaw dropping assertions  most significantly that the company s exploitation of personal data had swung the results of Britain s 2016 referendum on leaving the European Union  He also suggested that his predecessor at Cambridge Analytica was murdered But mostly  Mr  Wylie tried to explain data mining  He looked like a cerebral skate rat  which might in other circumstances have undermined his credibility  but in this case it seemed to help  He was polite  He resembled  as one journalist put it   a patient grandson trying to set up a Skype call with his gran  His message was clear  If you aren t already worried about how your personal data is being used  now would be a good time to start   The way I like to think of it  data is the electricity of our new economy  and electricity can be quite dangerous   he said   We enjoy the benefits of electricity  despite the fact that it can literally kill you  Cambridge Analytica released a statement describing Mr  Wylie as  a part time contractor who left in July 2014 and has no direct knowledge of our work or practices since then   It said Cambridge Analytica  a subsidiary of the SCL political consultancy  did not use its cache of data in Donald J  Trump s 2016 campaign  and had no involvement in the European Union referendum that ended with a victory for those who support withdrawal  or Brexit  from the bloc Mr  Wylie s testimony bluntly contradicted that of his former boss  Alexander Nix  who has recently appeared before the same committee twice  Mr  Wylie said a cluster of pro Brexit organizations employed a Canadian subsidiary company  Aggregate IQ  which provided them with SCL s store of data  I think it is completely reasonable to say that there could have been a different outcome of the referendum had there not been  in my view  cheating   he said He also suggested that Russian intelligence agencies could have easily scooped up the company s vast library of data on American voters in advance of the 2016 elections in the United States  because Aleksandr Kogan  the scientist who collected it  made regular return trips to Russia  Put a key logger in Kogan s computer in Russia and you ve got everything   Mr  Wylie said  He added   It would make it incredibly easy for them to get access to this data  For me  that s concerning and I think it should be looked into  Mr  Wylie s appearance has coincided with a surge of collective dismay over data mining  and many found themselves riveted by his testimony on Tuesday  Georgia Rakusen  33  a user researcher at a technology firm in London  urged her Twitter followers to tune into the hearing  which she called  absolutely gripping stuff  His testimony  she said   was something that  as a lay person  you could watch and start to grasp the enormity of how your data is used   I think maybe people are just beginning to open up  to realize that maybe it s not just about ads  maybe it s not just what bands I like   she said  Ms  Rakusen  who described her own work as  a space where we are supposed to make people click more   said she hoped that employees of large technology companies would come forward more  looking at whistle blowers like Mr  Wylie and Edward J  Snowden  I didn t watch the whole three and a half hours   she said   But I basically didn t get any other work done during that time  Mr  Wylie  who has described himself a  gay Canadian vegan   dropped out of high school but discovered a genius for coding and  still in his teens  began working for political campaigns  He came close to losing his composure at only one moment on Tuesday  when he was asked what prompted him to turn against the technology he had helped create  He said his views had changed when Mr  Trump was elected  It was no longer this niche  shady firm   he said   It was a firm that was making a massive impact on the world  It s a process of coming to terms with what you have created  and the impact that has had   I am incredibly remorseful for my role in setting it up   he added  his voice wavering   I m the first person to say that I should have known better  But what s done is done  He was caustic on the subject of his former boss  Mr  Nix  who he said enjoyed the colonial challenge of manipulating the affairs of less developed countries  He recalled that once  they were late to a meeting because Mr  Nix had to collect a chandelier he had bought for  283 000  You have to remember that a lot of these people are very wealthy already   he said   The thing that I learned is for certain wealthy people  they need something to keep them occupied  They need projects  And for certain wealthy people  going into the developing world and running a country is something that appeals to them  At times  he seemed slightly pitying of British officials who are investigating data mining  saying they did not have enough resources and lacked a  robust technical background   I have had to explain and re explain and re explain and re explain  you know  how relational databases work  what is an eigenvector  what is dimensionality reduction   he said  They have been working really  really hard  But as a point of observation  one of the weak points that I ve seen   again  this is an empathetic criticism   is the lack of technical people   he said  apparently searching for a polite way to say it   They have had to ask me a lot of questions that a database engineer would not ask  
NEW YORK    Facebook s CEO apologized for the Cambridge Analytica scandal with ads in multiple U S  and British newspapers Sunday  saying the social media platform doesn t deserve to hold personal information if it can t protect it The ads signed by Mark Zuckerberg said a quiz app built by a Cambridge University researcher leaked Facebook data of millions of people four years ago   This was a breach of trust  and I m sorry we didn t do more at the time  We re now taking steps to make sure this doesn t happen again   the ads said Facebook s privacy practices have come under fire after Cambridge Analytica  a political consulting firm affiliated with President Donald Trump s 2016 election campaign  got data inappropriately  The firm is alleged to have created psychological profiles to influence how people vote or even think about politics and society Facebook s stock value has dropped more than  70 billion since the revelations were first published Among the newspapers with the ads were The New York Times and The Washington Post in the U S  and The Sunday Times and The Sunday Telegraph in the United Kingdom The ads said Facebook is limiting the data apps receive when users sign in  It s also investigating every app that had access to large amounts of data   We expect there are others  And when we find them  we will ban them and tell everyone affected   the ads stated Zuckerberg closed the ads by saying   I promise to do better for you  Cambridge Analytica got the data from a researcher who paid 270 000 Facebook users to complete a psychological profile quiz back in 2014  But the quiz gathered information on their friends as well  bringing the total number of people affected to about 50 million The Trump campaign paid the firm  6 million during the 2016 election  although it has since distanced itself from Cambridge 
LONDON    Britain s information regulator said Saturday it was assessing evidence gathered from a raid on the office of data mining firm Cambridge Analytica  part of an investigation into alleged misuse of personal information by political campaigns and social media companies like Facebook More than a dozen investigators from the Information Commissioner s Office entered the company s central London office late Friday  shortly after a High Court judge granted a warrant  The investigators were seen leaving the premises early Saturday after spending about seven hours searching the office The regulator said it will  consider the evidence before deciding the next steps and coming to any conclusions   This is one part of a larger investigation by the ICO into the use of personal data and analytics by political campaigns  parties  social media companies and other commercial actors   it said Authorities in Britain as well as the U S  are investigating Cambridge Analytica over allegations the firm improperly obtained data from 50 million Facebook users and used it to manipulate elections  including the 2016 White House race and the 2016 Brexit vote in Britain Both Cambridge Analytica and Facebook deny wrongdoing The data firm suspended its CEO Alexander Nix this week after Britain s Channel 4 News broadcast footage that appeared to show Nix suggesting tactics like entrapment or bribery that his company could use to discredit politicians  The footage also showed Nix saying Cambridge Analytica played a major role in securing Donald Trump s victory in the 2016 U S  presidential election Cambridge Analytica s acting chief executive  Alexander Tayler  said Friday that he was sorry that SCL Elections  an affiliate of his company   licensed Facebook data and derivatives from a research company  Global Science Research  that had not received consent from most respondents  in 2014  The company believed that the data had been obtained in line with Facebook s terms of service and data protection laws   Tayler said His statement said the data was deleted in 2015 at Facebook s request  and denied that any of the Facebook data that Cambridge Analytica obtained was used in the work it did on the 2016 U S  election

NEW DELHI    India has set a March 31 deadline for London based political consultancy Cambridge Analytica to respond to a query on whether it was engaged to improperly harvest Facebook data on Indian citizens  the information technology ministry said India s information technology minister last week warned against any abuse of social media in elections  following reports that the analytics firm improperly accessed information on millions of Facebook users to target U S  voters Friday s notice to the firm followed local media reports that Indian political parties had used the data analytics firm during elections India is preparing for a general election in 2019 and several states will elect new assemblies this year and the next  The fairness of Indian democracy and electoral process is a matter of pride and any attempt to influence the sanctity of the electoral franchise through dubious and questionable means is unacceptable   the ministry said in a statement Attempts by Reuters to seek comment from the firm  via social media  went unanswered The ministry raised six questions in its notice  from whether the firm had engaged in profiling based on the data collected  to how the data was used and if consent had been secured from the concerned individuals The government was deeply concerned with allegations that data could have been used to influence people s behavior  the ministry said The ministry has threatened to take legal action against companies and individuals engaging in any unauthorized use of such data  Reporting by Malini Menon  Editing by Clarence Fernandez

SAN FRANCISCO   Facebook s chief executive  Mark Zuckerberg  on Wednesday publicly addressed for the first time the misuse of data belonging to 50 million users of the social network and described the steps the company would take to safeguard the information of its more than two billion monthly users Although his statement addressing a chorus of criticism fell short of a full throated apology  Mr  Zuckerberg said that Facebook would contact users whose data had been harvested through a personality quiz app and passed along to the political data firm Cambridge Analytica  We have a responsibility to protect your data   Mr  Zuckerberg said Wednesday in a Facebook post   and if we can t then we don t deserve to serve you  Mr  Zuckerberg  33  was trying to quell the crisis over the disclosure last weekend that Cambridge Analytica had used data that had been improperly obtained from Facebook as the firm worked on behalf of Donald J  Trump s presidential campaign  Are there other Cambridge Analyticas out there   Mr  Zuckerberg said later in an interview with The New York Times  He added   Were there apps which could have gotten access to more information and potentially sold it without us knowing or done something that violated people s trust  We also need to make sure we get that under control  Mr  Zuckerberg said the company would investigate apps like the third party quiz app that had previously obtained access to  large amounts of information  from the social network  He also said the company would restrict third party developers  access  We also made mistakes  there s more to do  and we need to step up and do it   he wrote in his Facebook statement The Cambridge Analytica revelations added to the questions that have been raised about Facebook s handling of user data and security  Those questions have only intensified as the company has faced criticism over the role its platform played in Russian attempts to influence the 2016 presidential election and the way it has been used to spread misinformation on the internet The resulting backlash is Facebook s worst crisis since it was founded by Mr  Zuckerberg and others in 2004  The information  photos and other content that users post and their frequent engagement with the platform is crucial to the social network  and to the company s profitability  Questions about user privacy and security threaten the company s standing at a time when people are already uneasy about whether the use of technology can bring good or ill Last Friday  after The New York Times  The Observer of London and Channel 4 in Britain told Facebook that Cambridge Analytica had not deleted all of the data it had obtained  the social network banned the political consulting firm and Aleksandr Kogan  the Cambridge University researcher who created the personality quiz app that was used to harvest user data  This was a breach of trust between Kogan  Cambridge Analytica and Facebook   Mr  Zuckerberg wrote on Wednesday   But it was also a breach of trust between Facebook and the people who share their data with us and expect us to protect it  Facebook representatives confirmed that Cambridge Analytica representatives met with Facebook on Tuesday to discuss lifting the ban  Mr  Zuckerberg told The Times he did not rule out allowing Cambridge Analytica back  saying Facebook must first conduct a  full forensic audit of the firm  and  have full confirmation that there s no wrongdoing here  The reaction to the Cambridge Analytica disclosure has been severe  Politicians in the United States and Britain have called for Mr  Zuckerberg to explain how his company handles user data  and state attorneys general in Massachusetts and New York have begun investigating Cambridge Analytica and Facebook  A  DeleteFacebook movement calling on people to close their accounts has also gathered steam In Washington  there have been more calls for regulation of internet companies like Facebook  Mr  Zuckerberg s troubles there were illustrated by the final passage on Wednesday of a bill to combat sex trafficking  The bill would lift liability protections that internet companies have enjoyed for content that users post on their platforms  Facebook and other internet giants had quietly fought the bill for more than a year  but eventually dropped their opposition Lawmakers who have demanded that Mr  Zuckerberg testify before Congress about Facebook s relationship with Cambridge Analytica were not appeased by his statement  You need to come to Congress and testify to this under oath   Senator Ed Markey  Democrat of Massachusetts  tweeted in response to Mr  Zuckerberg s post Independent researchers who have used data from Facebook said that Mr  Zuckerberg s statement did not acknowledge how the gathering of user data was fundamental to the company s operations  He avoided the big issue  which is that for many years  Facebook was basically giving away user data like it was handing out candy   said Jonathan Albright  research director at the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University   There is no question that handing out that data made Facebook the success it is as a company  This has to be recognized as part of their business model and not just a one off problem  In his statement  Mr  Zuckerberg laid out a timeline of Facebook s dealings with Cambridge Analytica  He traced the information sharing issue to 2007  when Facebook decided to become an open platform   enabling people to use Facebook to log into other apps and share detailed personal information about themselves and their friends In 2013  Mr  Kogan  the Cambridge researcher  created a personality quiz app that about 300 000 people installed  Mr  Zuckerberg wrote  Because Facebook was an open platform  Mr  Kogan was able to collect data on tens of millions of friends of those users who had installed the personality quiz app A year later  Mr  Zuckerberg said  Facebook changed its policy to limit how much data third party apps could access   These actions would prevent any app like Kogan s from being able to access so much data today   he wrote By 2015  Mr  Kogan had shared his data and findings with Cambridge Analytica  which later used the material to single out American voters  Mr  Zuckerberg said Facebook had banned Mr  Kogan s app and demanded that the researcher and Cambridge Analytica formally certify that the data had been deleted  He did not address in his post why Facebook had not already disclosed those activities to its users whose data had been harvested by Mr  Kogan and Cambridge Analytica  Whenever there s an issue where someone s data gets passed to someone who the rules of the system shouldn t have allowed it to  that s rightfully a big issue and deserves to be a big uproar   Mr  Zuckerberg said in the interview For Mr  Zuckerberg  the outcry over Cambridge Analytica has been personally damaging  Inside Facebook  even his staunch supporters have described a tense atmosphere  Some employees have sought to transfer to other divisions  such as the messaging app WhatsApp and the photo sharing platform Instagram  calling their work on Facebook s main product  demoralizing  Mr  Zuckerberg spent part of the past week hunkered down with a small group of engineers to discuss how to make information on Facebook s users more secure  and to potentially give them more control of their data  according to two Facebook employees who declined to be named because the proceedings were confidential His silence on the matter has prompted mounting criticism in the past few days  Facebook held a staff meeting on Tuesday to answer questions about Cambridge Analytica and the surrounding outcry  but Mr  Zuckerberg did not appear at the event  He was scheduled to appear at a staff meeting that was set for Friday In his interview with The Times  Mr  Zuckerberg said that the company s efforts to safeguard its platform from bad behavior   which includes preparing for possible interference attempts in the 2018 midterm elections   were an important part of a larger transformation at the company  which has had to adjust from its roots as a social network for college students into a powerful global information hub  If you had asked me  when I got started with Facebook  if one of the central things I d need to work on now is preventing governments from interfering in each other s elections  there s no way I thought that s what I d be doing if we talked in 2004 in my dorm room   Mr  Zuckerberg said 
LONDON   Two senior advisers to Prime Minister Theresa May might have conspired to bypass electoral spending laws when they were leading a campaign for Britain to leave the European Union  a former employee of their effort said this week  in an interview and in testimony he gave to the country s elections regulator The allegations led to a heated exchange  conducted in the British news media  involving allegations of hard feelings over an old romance and of the deliberate outing by the prime minister s office  No  10 Downing Street  of the former employee as gay The former employee  Shahmir Sanni  said in the interview and in a witness statement submitted to the regulator  the Electoral Commission  that the two advisers had funneled more than  900 000 in campaign spending through a puppet organization that they had set up  They did so  he said  by paying the money to a digital advertising firm that was indirectly linked to the Trump campaign and also worked on the push to exit the European Union Mr  Sanni volunteered at Vote Leave  the main campaign led in part by the two advisers to the prime minister  and then at the organization that he now says was a puppet  called BeLeave  He spoke with The New York Times for a joint reporting project with The Observer of Britain The allegations are the latest of many raised on both sides of the referendum about the possible diversion of money through allied organizations to get around funding limits on each of them  and campaign finance experts said the multitude of such claims pointed to holes and ambiguities in the regulations that governed the referendum In response  one of the two Downing Street advisers  Stephen Parkinson  said that Vote Leave had adhered to all relevant laws  Mr  Parkinson also suggested that Mr  Sanni was lashing out because the two had  dated for 18 months  before splitting up   I thought amicably   in September 2017  He said he had not spoken to Mr  Sanni as a supervisor from the Vote Leave campaign  but as a friend   That is the capacity in which I gave Shahmir advice and encouragement  and I can understand if the lines became blurred for him   Mr  Parkinson said in the statement   but I am clear that I did not direct the activities of any separate campaign groups  The other adviser  Cleo Watson  could not be reached for comment Mr  Sanni said his relationship with Mr  Parkinson had been a short fling that started after the referendum  In a statement  he said the disclosure of his sexual orientation had endangered his family  who live in Pakistan  and he accused Mr  Parkinson of intimidation  I never imagined that he  with the help of No  10  would choose to tell the world I am gay  in a last  desperate attempt to scare me   Mr  Sanni said His lawyer  Tamsin Allen  said in a statement   We believe this is the first time a Downing Street official statement has been used to out someone  British campaign finance experts said the allegations about Vote Leave underscored the porousness and ineffectiveness of rules on spending around referendums like the vote in 2016 to exit the European Union  They were useless   said Justin Fisher  a professor of political science at Brunel University London who has studied the regulations for the Electoral Commission  which oversees elections and regulates political finance in Britain Multiple organizations  each with its own spending limit  were allowed to campaign in parallel on either side of the referendum issue  and they were allowed to work together in ill defined ways  allowing donors on either side many ways to sidestep spending limits  Mr  Fisher noted The rules  had never really been tested before because we never had a referendum of any consequence before   Mr  Fisher said  noting that in total the supporters of remaining in the European Union had outspent the advocates of leaving Mr  Sanni s allegations have come to light because of a tangle of connections to an online consulting company with ties to the campaign that elected President Trump   Cambridge Analytica Mr  Sanni is friends with Christopher Wylie  a former research director of Cambridge Analytica who has recently provided information to journalists indicating that the company improperly obtained  the data of 50 million Facebook users in order to help target voters The Vote Leave campaign relied heavily for online ad placement on a Canadian company called AggregateIQ  which according to documents and testimony submitted to the Electoral Commission by Mr  Wylie was a satellite business set up to support Cambridge Analytica Public filings also show that Vote Leave provided virtually the entire  990 000 budget of BeLeave   625 000 pounds   which took the form of additional spending paid directly to AggregateIQ As Mr  Wylie was coming forward with his disclosures about Cambridge Analytica  he encouraged his friend Mr  Sanni to come forward with his claims about Vote Leave and BeLeave as well Testimony and documents provided by Mr  Wylie in his filing to the Electoral Commission show that AggregateIQ was founded in 2013 in discussion with executives at Cambridge Analytica s parent company  initially licensed all its software from that company  and for a time received virtually all its income from the company In a statement this week  Jeff Silvester  one of the founders of AggregateIQ  said it was a  digital advertising  web and software development company  and  has never managed  nor did we ever have access to  any Facebook data or database allegedly obtained improperly by Cambridge Analytica  Mr  Silvester did not address the company s work for Vote Leave and BeLeave  A spokesman for Cambridge Analytica did not respond to a request for comment An initial investigation by the Electoral Commission found nothing improper in the relationship between the two organizations  but a court appeal last fall prompted the commission to reopen its inquiry  Mr  Sanni s testimony is additional information recently submitted to that ongoing inquiry He and Mr  Wylie also gave the commission records showing that anyone at Vote Leave continued to have access to the Google Drive used for BeLeave s strategy  planning and internal discussion after the referendum  on June 23  2016 Mr  Sanni graduated from the University of East Anglia at the end of 2015  and began volunteering the next March for the Vote Leave campaign  He worked with a small team of young volunteers in what was then a unit of Vote Leave called BeLeave that tried to craft messages to turn young and liberal people against the European Union by arguing  for example  that it closed doors to the non European world The small BeLeave team initially worked in the same office as Vote Leave and under the oversight of its senior staff  including Mr  Parkinson and Ms  Watson  as did two AggregateIQ employees managing the campaign s online advertising  Mr  Sanni testified to the commission By mid May  however  with the referendum little more than a month away  the Vote Leave campaign was nearing its spending cap At about the same time  the leaders of the Vote Leave campaign instructed their lawyers to draw up a charter for BeLeave to become an independent group  Mr  Sanni was named its secretary and research director while another friend  Darren Grimes  was named its principal and campaign director Mr  Sanni told the commission he was surprised to learn that the leaders of Vote Leave had also decided to direct  900 000 to BeLeave  given that it was overseen by two unpaid  inexperienced people  He and Mr  Grimes were then both 22  But then his friend Mr  Grimes explained that virtually all of that money would be paid directly to AggregateIQ for online advertising In practice  Mr  Sanni said  nothing changed  The BeLeave staff continued to work inside the Vote Leave office  The senior officials of Vote Leave continued to approve their messages  And the same AggregateIQ workers continued to place BeLeave s online advertisements while providing the same service to Vote Leave  We never saw ourselves as a separate organization from the get go   Mr  Sanni said in an interview  echoing his testimony   We were just volunteers  The money paid to AggregateIQ for online advertising produced few results for BeLeave   1 164 email sign ups and 1 005 mobile phone numbers for more than  900 000   leading Mr  Sanni to suspect the money may have gone to promote the larger Vote Leave campaign instead He insisted in the interview that the reason he provided testimony to the commission was not about any past feelings for Mr  Parkinson  now at No  10 Instead  he said  it was out of concern for Mr  Grimes  the other young volunteer  By making Mr  Grimes the nominal owner of BeLeave  the leaders of Vote Leave had made him a target of critical news coverage and potential legal claims  Mr  Sanni argued   He is getting thrown to the dogs   Mr  Sanni said   Everything I am doing is to protect Darren   I now feel sick about what happened   Mr  Sanni said in his testimony  The officials of Vote Leave  used two 22 year olds to cheat in the referendum  Mr  Grimes did not respond to messages seeking comment

Perhaps at some point in the past few years you ve told Facebook that you like  say  Kim Kardashian West  When you hit the thumbs up button on her page  you probably did it because you wanted to see the reality TV star s posts in your news feed  Maybe you realized that marketers could target advertisements to you based on your interest in her What you probably missed is that researchers had figured out how to tie your interest in Ms  Kardashian West to certain personality traits  such as how extroverted you are  very   how conscientious  more than most  and how open minded  only somewhat   And when your fondness for Ms  Kardashian West is combined with other interests you ve indicated on Facebook  researchers believe their algorithms can predict the nuances of your political views with better accuracy than your loved ones As The New York Times reported on Saturday  that is what motivated the consulting firm Cambridge Analytica to collect data from more than 50 million Facebook users  without their consent  to build its own behavioral models to target potential voters in various political campaigns  The company has worked for a political action committee started by John R  Bolton  who served in the George W  Bush administration  as well as for President Trump s presidential campaign in 2016   We find your voters and move them to action   the firm boasts on its website Cambridge Analytica now says it has destroyed the user data it collected on Facebook  Raw data reviewed by The Times suggests the information  or copies of it  may still exist  In either case  specific user information was merely a means to an end  a building block in a far more ambitious construction  a behavioral model powerful enough to manipulate people s activity and  potentially  sway elections The firm adapted its approach to personality modeling from studies conducted by researchers at Stanford University and the Psychometrics Center at the University of Cambridge  The studies relied on data collected by a Facebook app called myPersonality  a 100 question quiz developed by the Psychometrics Center that assessed a person s openness  conscientiousness  extroversion  agreeableness and neuroticism  traits commonly referred to in the academic community by the acronym Ocean Many respondents who took the quiz through the myPersonality app authorized it to gain access to their Facebook profile data  and information about their friend network   access that was allowed by the social network at the time  That allowed researchers to cross reference the results of the quiz   numeric Ocean scores   with the users  Facebook  likes   and build a model from the correlations they found between the two  With that model  the researchers could often make precise guesses about subsequent users  personalities using only a list of their likes  no 100 question quiz necessary One of the studies the Psychometrics Center produced  published in 2015 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences  was built on the  likes  and Ocean scores of more than 70 000 respondents who took the myPersonality quiz on Facebook  It found that a person who liked the movie  Fight Club   for example  was far more likely to be open to new experiences than a person who liked  American Idol   according to a review of data provided to The Times by Michal Kosinski  an author of the 2015 study and a professor of organizational behavior at Stanford In that study  the researchers compared the accuracy of their model with personality assessments made by the respondents  friends  The friends were given a 10 question version of the myPersonality quiz and asked to answer based on their knowledge of the respondents  personalities Based on a sample of more than 32 000 participants who were assessed by both the model and one or two friends  the researchers found that the model  using just 10 likes  was more accurate than a work colleague  With 70 likes  it was more accurate than a friend or roommate  with 150  more accurate than a family member  and with 300  more accurate than a spouse The model  the researchers said  was particularly adept at  predicting life outcomes such as substance use  political attitudes and physical health   The real world efficacy of the approach  however  has been called into question When Cambridge Analytica approached the Psychometrics Center about using its models  the center declined  Cambridge Analytica then turned to Aleksandr Kogan  a psychology professor at Cambridge University who was familiar with the center s work  Dr  Kogan developed a Facebook app called  thisisyourdigitallife   a quiz similar to myPersonality  and used it to harvest data from more than 50 million Facebook profiles  Of those  30 million contained enough information to generate personality profiles  Only 270 000 users authorized Dr  Kogan s app to have access to their data  and all were told that their information was being used for academic research Cambridge then pitched its services to potential political and commercial clients  ranging from Mastercard and the New York Yankees to the Joint Chiefs of Staff Facebook has now banned Cambridge Analytica from its platform  as well as its parent company and Dr  Kogan  In Facebook s eyes  Dr  Kogan s infraction was not collecting the data  but giving it to Cambridge Analytica  Although Kogan gained access to this information in a legitimate way and through the proper channels that governed all developers on Facebook at that time  he did not subsequently abide by our rules   Facebook s deputy general counsel said in a statement on Friday By handing over that information to a private company  Facebook said  Dr  Kogan violated its terms of service Facebook in 2015 changed its policies  including altering rules about how third party apps can gain access to information about users  friends  But user data collected through such apps over the years probably remains in the wild  not to mention the models that can continue to be used to target people around the world 
As Facebook grapples with a backlash over its role in spreading disinformation  an internal dispute over how to handle the threat and the public outcry is resulting in the departure of a senior executive The impending exit of that executive   Alex Stamos  Facebook s chief information security officer   reflects heightened leadership tension at the top of the social network  Much of the internal disagreement is rooted in how much Facebook should publicly share about how nation states misused the platform and debate over organizational changes in the run up to the 2018 midterm elections  according to current and former employees briefed on the matter Mr  Stamos  who plans to leave Facebook by August  had advocated more disclosure around Russian interference of the platform and some restructuring to better address the issues  but was met with resistance by colleagues  said the current and former employees  In December  Mr  Stamos s day to day responsibilities were reassigned to others  they said Mr  Stamos said he would leave Facebook but was persuaded to stay through August to oversee the transition of his responsibilities and because executives thought his departure would look bad  the people said  He has been overseeing the transfer of his security team to Facebook s product and infrastructure divisions  His group  which once had 120 people  now has three  the current and former employees said Mr  Stamos would be the first high ranking employee to leave Facebook since controversy over disinformation on its site  Company leaders   including Mark Zuckerberg  Facebook s chief executive  and Sheryl Sandberg  the chief operating officer   have struggled to address a growing set of problems  including Russian interference on the platform  the rise of false news and the disclosure over the weekend that 50 million of its user profiles had been harvested by Cambridge Analytica  a voter profiling company The developments have taken a toll internally  said the seven people briefed on the matter  who asked not to be identified because the proceedings were confidential  Some of the company s executives are weighing their own legacies and reputations as Facebook s image has taken a beating  Several believe the company would have been better off saying little about Russian interference and note that other companies  such as Twitter  which have stayed relatively quiet on the issue  have not had to deal with as much criticism One central tension at Facebook has been that of the legal and policy teams versus the security team  The security team generally pushed for more disclosure about how nation states had misused the site  but the legal and policy teams have prioritized business imperatives  said the people briefed on the matter  The people whose job is to protect the user always are fighting an uphill battle against the people whose job is to make money for the company   said Sandy Parakilas  who worked at Facebook enforcing privacy and other rules until 2012 and now advises a nonprofit organization called the Center for Humane Technology  which is looking at the effect of technology on people Mr  Stamos said in statement on Monday   These are really challenging issues  and I ve had some disagreements with all of my colleagues  including other executives   On Twitter  he said he was  still fully engaged with my work at Facebook  and acknowledged that his role has changed  without addressing his future plans Facebook did not have a comment on the broader issues around Mr  Stamos s departure Mr  Stamos joined Facebook from Yahoo in June 2015  He and other Facebook executives  such as Ms  Sandberg  disagreed early on over how proactive the social network should be in policing its own platform  said the people briefed on the matter  In his statement  Mr  Stamos said his relationship with Ms  Sandberg was  productive  Mr  Stamos first put together a group of engineers to scour Facebook for Russian activity in June 2016  the month the Democratic National Committee announced it had been attacked by Russian hackers  the current and former employees said By November 2016  the team had uncovered evidence that Russian operatives had aggressively pushed DNC leaks and propaganda on Facebook  That same month  Mr  Zuckerberg publicly dismissed the notion that fake news influenced the 2016 election  calling it a  pretty crazy idea  In the ensuing months  Facebook s security team found more Russian disinformation and propaganda on its site  according to the current and former employees  By the spring of 2017  deciding how much Russian interference to disclose publicly became a major source of contention within the company Mr  Stamos pushed to disclose as much as possible  while others including Elliot Schrage  Facebook s vice president of communications and policy  recommended not naming Russia without more ironclad evidence  said the current and former employees A detailed memorandum Mr  Stamos wrote in early 2017 describing Russian interference was scrubbed for mentions of Russia and winnowed into a blog post last April that outlined  in hypothetical terms  how Facebook could be manipulated by a foreign adversary  they said  Russia was only referenced in a vague footnote  That footnote acknowledged that Facebook s findings did not contradict a declassified January 2017 report in which the director of national intelligence concluded Russia had sought to undermine United States election  and Hillary Clinton in particular Mr  Stamos said in his statement that  we decided that the responsible thing to do would be to make clear that our findings were consistent with those released by the U S  intelligence community  which clearly connected the activity in their report to Russian state sponsored actors  But Facebook s decision to omit Russia backfired  Weeks later  a Time magazine article revealed that Russia had created fake accounts and purchased fake ads to spread propaganda on the platform  allegations that Facebook initially denied By last September  after Mr  Stamos s investigation had revealed further Russian interference  Facebook was forced to reverse course  That month  the company disclosed that beginning in June 2015  Russians had paid Facebook  100 000 to run roughly 3 000 divisive ads to show the American electorate In response  lawmakers like Senator Mark Warner of Virginia  the top Democrat on the intelligence committee  said that although Facebook s revelation was a good first step   I m disappointed it s taken 10 months of raising this issue before they ve become much more transparent  And the revelation also prompted more attention into how Russians had manipulated the social network  Last October and November  Facebook was grilled in front of lawmakers on Capitol Hill for Russian meddling on its platform  along with executives from Twitter and YouTube The public reaction caused some at Facebook to recoil at revealing more  said the current and former employees  Since the 2016 election  Facebook has paid unusual attention to the reputations of Mr  Zuckerberg and Ms  Sandberg  conducting polls to track how they are viewed by the public  said Tavis McGinn  who was recruited to the company last April and headed the executive reputation efforts through September 2017 Mr  McGinn  who now heads Honest Data  which has done polling about Facebook s reputation in different countries  said Facebook is  caught in a Catch 22   Facebook cares so much about its image that the executives don t want to come out and tell the whole truth when things go wrong   he said   But if they don t  it damages their image  Mr  McGinn said he left Facebook after becoming disillusioned with the company s conduct By December 2017  Mr  Stamos  who reports to Facebook s general counsel  proposed that he report directly to higher ups  Facebook executives rejected that proposal and instead reassigned Mr  Stamos s team  splitting the security team between its product team  overseen by Guy Rosen  and infrastructure team  overseen by Pedro Canahuati  according to current and former employees Apart from managing a small team of engineers in San Francisco  Mr  Stamos has largely been left as Facebook s security communicator  Last month  he appeared as Facebook s representative at the Munich Security Conference Over the weekend  after news broke that Cambridge Analytica had harvested data on as many as 50 million Facebook users  Facebook s communications team encouraged Mr  Stamos to tweet in defense of the company  but only after it asked to approve Mr  Stamos s tweets  according to two people briefed on the incident After the tweets set off a furious response  Mr  Stamos deleted them Roger B  McNamee  an early investor in Facebook who said he considered himself a mentor to Mr  Zuckerberg  said the company was failing to face the fundamental problems posed by the Russian meddling and other manipulation of content  I told them   Your business is based on trust  and you re losing trust    said Mr  McNamee  a founder of the Center for Humane Technology   They were treating it as a P R  problem  when it s a business problem  I couldn t believe these guys I once knew so well had gotten so far off track  
Each week  Kevin Roose  technology columnist at The New York Times  discusses developments in the tech industry  offering analysis and maybe a joke or two  Want this newsletter in your inbox  Sign up here You know those weeks when crazy things happen at work  your entire schedule goes haywire and the concept of a good night s sleep starts to resemble a hazy and futile dream  like full employment or healthy pizza Well  folks  this was one of those weeks  On Friday night  when Facebook published a blog post saying that it had suspended Cambridge Analytica for misappropriating user data   a post that was intended to pre empt articles by The New York Times and The Observer of London about that very subject  which were published the next day   it became clear that this was a new kind of Facebook privacy scandal  It has already led to congressional inquiries and user revolts  thrusting the company into the kind of chaos it had not seen in its 14 year history On Wednesday  after a five day silence and lots of speculation about his whereabouts  Mark Zuckerberg  Facebook s chief executive  finally re emerged with a Facebook post and an interview with my colleague Sheera Frenkel and me  among others  You can read the transcript of our interview here  and read our article about Facebook s horrible week here We had only about 30 minutes on the phone with Mr  Zuckerberg  but we managed to get him to address several important topics  the Cambridge Analytica mess  Facebook s lax data policies  its plans to clamp down on third party developer access and notify users whose data was misused  election interference  including previously unreported Macedonian attempts to interfere in last year s Alabama special election  and Facebook s broader responsibility as a global power But Mr  Zuckerberg s responses also raised more questions Here  for example  is how he answered a question about Facebook s business model  which is based on selling advertisers and developers the ability to target Facebook users based on their personal data Narrowly  it may be true that being free and ad supported helps Facebook achieve its goals of connecting billions of people to its services  Facebook has developed a number of ways to make itself cheaper and easier to access   including  in some countries  effectively subsidizing use through its Free Basics program  which allows people to use Facebook without its counting toward their data plans But it s not clear this approach has served society well  Especially in countries like Myanmar  where Facebook was recently blamed by United Nations investigators for fueling ethnic violence against the Rohingya  it s possible that having a slightly higher barrier to entry would be a net good  even if it cost Facebook some users in the short term   And it s not even clear that it would  People already pay for their cellphones and data plans all over the world  and might be willing to part with a small fee to keep using their favorite social network  Switching to a subscription model wouldn t fix all of Facebook s problems overnight  There would still be foreign actors trying to interfere in elections  false news and divisive content intending to sway public opinion  and innumerable other issues  But moving away from an ad supported model would make the network harder to exploit   Bot networks are less effective on subscription platforms  for example   And it would lessen the company s incentive to sell out its users  privacy to advertisers Facebook has already shown a willingness to try new models  WhatsApp  for example  makes money by charging businesses for an enterprise product that lets them message their customers  And this week  in an announcement immediately buried by an avalanche of other news about the company  Facebook said it was experimenting with a subscription model that would allow popular creators to charge  5 per month for access to their posts What if all of Facebook cost  5 per month to use  and certain types of divisive and exploitable ad categories and behaviors were removed from the network entirely  Would users revolt en masse  and decide to colonize some other free social media app  Would Facebook collapse without a pipeline of advertising dollars Maybe  But being smaller might not be a bad thing  If we ve learned anything from this year s troubles  it s this  Facebook s platform problems multiply as it gets bigger and more complex  but its ability to deal with those problems stays fairly constant  Zuckerberg might be dedicated to fixing Facebook s problems  but unless he addresses its biggest problem of all   its enormous scale  paired with a business model that requires the company to monetize its users  private data to the greatest extent possible   there s only so much he can do Kevin Roose writes a column called The Shift and is a writer at large for The New York Times Magazine  You can follow him on Twitter here   kevinroose 
When a former engineer revealed a pattern of sexual harassment at Uber last year  Travis Kalanick  then the company s chief executive  said he would immediately open an investigation When users complained about bugs and problems with the Apple Maps app in 2012  Tim Cook  the company s chief executive  released a statement that said  we fell short  And in 2011  when Netflix tried to split off its mail order DVD business into a company called Qwikster  its chief executive  Reed Hastings  wrote a letter to the public   I messed up   he said   I owe everyone an explanation  But in the past week  as Facebook plunged into a crisis over how Cambridge Analytica  a political consulting firm that provided voter targeting services to the Trump campaign  improperly obtained data on 50 million Facebook users  Mark Zuckerberg  the social network s chief executive  said  well  nothing Neither Mr  Zuckerberg nor Sheryl Sandberg  Facebook s chief operating officer  has made any public appearances this week  Mr  Zuckerberg s last public post on Facebook was a March 2 photo of himself and his wife  Priscilla Chan  baking hamantaschen cookies to celebrate the Jewish holiday of Purim  Ms  Sandberg s most recent post was a four day old photo from her child s debate competition  Updated  Mark Zuckerberg Breaks His Silence  Vows Action to Bolster Data Privacy Facebook employees have described a tense atmosphere in which some joked about selling their stock in the company before it took another dip  The company has lost about  50 billion in market value in the last couple of days  Over the past few months  as criticism of the company s role in the 2016 election has escalated  some employees have sought to transfer to other divisions of the company  such as WhatsApp and Instagram  calling their work on Facebook s main product  demoralizing  On Monday  The New York Times reported that Alex Stamos  the company s chief security officer  was slated to leave the company in August after disagreements with other top executives over the handling of Russia s exploitation of Facebook s platform during the 2016 election season  On Tuesday  Brian Acton  a co founder of WhatsApp  which was acquired by Facebook in 2014 for  19 billion  posted a tweet that read   It is time   deletefacebook   Mr  Acton did not return a request for comment Two people familiar with the matter  who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the discussions were confidential  said that Mr  Zuckerberg planned to address the Cambridge Analytica situation and the larger data privacy issues with a public statement on Wednesday  The statement will be aimed at rebuilding trust with users  one of the people said  In the past week  one of the people said  Mr  Zuckerberg has spent significant time hunkered down with a small group of engineers to discuss how to make Facebook s users more secure  with more control of their data Kate Losse  an early Facebook employee and Mr  Zuckerberg s former speechwriter  said that the Cambridge Analytica controversy was different from previous Facebook privacy scandals  in that it was about an issue at the core of the company s business model that will not be easily remedied  the disclosure of Facebook data to outside sources through its third party developer platform  My guess is that what is giving Zuckerberg pause at this point is the question of how to acknowledge and explain this state of affairs while at the same time mitigating the concerns that will come from people finally understanding how this all worked   she said Mr  Zuckerberg is no stranger to speaking out during times of company crisis  In 2006  users rebelled after Facebook introduced the first version of its news feed  which showed users for the first time what their friends were doing on the social network  As groups formed to protest what they felt was an incursion on their privacy  Mr  Zuckerberg posted a peacemaking note on his Facebook page  Calm down  Breathe  We hear you   he wrote 
WASHINGTON   Facebook on Sunday faced a backlash about how it protects user data  as American and British lawmakers demanded that it explain how a political data firm with links to President Trump s 2016 campaign was able to harvest private information from more than 50 million Facebook profiles without the social network s alerting users Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota  a Democratic member of the Senate Judiciary Committee  went so far as to press for Mark Zuckerberg  Facebook s chief executive  to appear before the panel to explain what the social network knew about the misuse of its data  to target political advertising and manipulate voters  The calls for greater scrutiny followed reports on Saturday in The New York Times and The Observer of London that Cambridge Analytica  a political data firm founded by Stephen K  Bannon and Robert Mercer  the wealthy Republican donor  had used the Facebook data to develop methods that it claimed could identify the personalities of individual American voters and influence their behavior  The firm s so called psychographic modeling underpinned its work for the Trump campaign in 2016  though many have questioned the effectiveness of its techniques But Facebook did not inform users whose data had been harvested  The lack of disclosure could violate laws in Britain and in many American states Damian Collins  a Conservative lawmaker in Britain who is leading a parliamentary inquiry into fake news and Russian meddling in the country s referendum to leave the European Union  said this weekend that he  too  would call on Mr  Zuckerberg or another top executive to testify  The social network sent executives who handle policy matters to answer questions at an earlier hearing in February  It is not acceptable that they have previously sent witnesses who seek to avoid answering difficult questions by claiming not to know the answers   Mr  Collins said in a statement   This also creates a false reassurance that Facebook s stated policies are always robust and effectively policed  The fallout from the reports added to questions Facebook was already confronting over the use of its platform by those seeking to spread Russian propaganda and fake news  The social media giant has grappled with the criticism over the issue for much of the past year  and struggled to keep public opinion on its side Over the weekend  Facebook was on the defensive  Top executives took to Twitter to argue that the company s protections had not been breached  and that Facebook was thus not at fault  This was unequivocally not a data breach   tweeted Andrew Bosworth  a Facebook executive   No systems were infiltrated  no passwords or information were stolen or hacked  The data was obtained in 2014  when Cambridge Analytica  through an outside researcher  paid users small sums to take a personality quiz and download an app  which would scrape some private information from their profiles and from those of their friends   activity that Facebook permitted at the time  The approach was based on a technique pioneered at Cambridge University by data scientists who claimed it could reveal more about a person than even their parents or romantic partners knew The researcher hired by Cambridge Analytica  Alexandr Kogan  told Facebook and his app s users that he was collecting information for academic purposes  not for a political data firm owned by a wealthy conservative  Facebook did nothing to verify how the information was being used Mr  Bosworth argued on Twitter that a violation had been committed only by Cambridge Analytica and Mr  Kogan  whose app  did not follow the data agreements  Facebook s chief security officer  Alex Stamos  issued a similar defense in a series of tweets that have since been deleted  The recent Cambridge Analytica stories by the NY Times and The Guardian are important and powerful  but it is incorrect to call this a  breach  under any reasonable definition of the term   Mr  Stamos tweeted The explanation did little  however  to stem the tide of anger as independent researchers pointed out that many others could have similarly misused Facebook data  Facebook s platform must protect us from predatory behavior   wrote a Twitter user named Evan Baily   or we can t and shouldn t trust the platform  Jonathan Albright  research director at the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University  wrote that the lack oversight and transparency into what sort of data Facebook collected on its users meant that the company s platform could continue to be exploited  Unethical people will always do bad things when we make it easy for them and there are few   if any   lasting repercussions   Mr  Albright said Paul Grewal  a vice president and deputy general counsel at Facebook  said in a statement that the company was looking into whether the data in question still existed   That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people s information   he said This month  The Times viewed a set of raw data from the profiles Cambridge Analytica obtained  And a former employee of the data firm described having recently seen hundreds of gigabytes of unencrypted data files on Cambridge servers There were also questions from technology experts and others about Facebook s reaction to the news reports by The Times and The Observer  especially its decision to suspend the account of Christopher Wylie  a data expert who oversaw Cambridge Analytica s data harvesting   but also spoke out about it to the two news organizations On Friday  Facebook threatened to sue The Observer to stop it from publishing  the newspaper s outgoing editor  John Mulholland  said on Twitter Then  late Friday evening  Facebook posted a statement that expressed alarm at the data leak  The company promised to take action and announced that it was suspending the accounts of Cambridge Analytica  Mr  Kogan and Mr  Wylie By then  Facebook had learned that Mr  Wylie  who left Cambridge Analytica in 2014  was a named source for the news reports In a statement on Sunday  Mr  Wylie described himself as  a curious and naïve 23 year old   when he first went to work for Cambridge Analytica  I feel a sense of regret every day when I see where they have helped take our world   he added   I need to make amends  and that s why I m coming forward  His lawyer  Tamsin Allen  said that last week Mr  Wylie offered to help Facebook recover the missing data Now  though  Facebook said on Sunday  Mr  Wylie is refusing to cooperate with the company until the suspension is lifted   a move the social network is not willing to make because of his role in the data harvesting In both Britain and the United States  lawmakers said that in the light of the new reports  they wanted fresh answers from both Facebook and Cambridge Analytica about how the data was obtained and what was done with it Mr  Collins  the British lawmaker  said he planned to call Alexander Nix  the chief executive of Cambridge Analytica  to return to Parliament and answer questions about testimony last month in which he claimed that the company never obtained or used Facebook data  It seems clear that he has deliberately misled the committee and Parliament   Mr  Collins said In the United States  the attorney general of Massachusetts  Maura Healey  announced on Saturday that her office was opening an investigation   Massachusetts residents deserve answers immediately from Facebook and Cambridge Analytica   she said in a Twitter post that linked to the Times article Also on Saturday  the two top Congressional Democrats leading inquiries into Russian interference in the 2016 election   Senator Mark Warner of Virginia and Representative Adam Schiff of California   called for investigations of the Facebook data leak  This raises serious questions about the level of detail that Cambridge Analytica knew about users   said Mr  Schiff  who is the ranking Democrat on the House intelligence committee 
In 2007  a young Mark Zuckerberg stood on a stage in San Francisco and announced that Facebook was throwing open its doors No longer  he said  would Facebook be a closed off software product like every other social network  Instead  it would become an open platform and invite outside developers to build apps and programs on top of it  We want to make Facebook into something of an operating system   Mr  Zuckerberg told a reporter At the time  the announcement drew little notice outside the programming world  Developers quickly went to work making fun and quirky apps that plugged into Facebook   early hits included  Rendezbook   a kind of proto Tinder that allowed users to match with each other for  random flings   and CampusRank  which allowed college students to nominate their peers for yearbook type awards Later  popular games like FarmVille arrived  and apps like Tinder and Spotify began allowing their users to log in using their Facebook credentials  In some ways  it was a fair trade  Facebook got to weave itself more deeply into users  internet habits  and the outside app developers got access to a big audience and valuable data about their users  In all  millions of apps have been created with Facebook s open platform tools Through it all  Facebook s users were mostly unfazed  Sure  these apps collected data about their lives  But they seemed convenient and harmless  and  really  what could go wrong Today  more than a decade later  the consequences of Facebook s laissez faire approach are becoming clear  Over the weekend  The New York Times reported that Cambridge Analytica  a British consulting firm  improperly acquired the private data of about roughly 50 million Facebook users  and used it to target voters on behalf of the Trump campaign during the 2016 presidential election What happened with Cambridge Analytica wasn t technically a data breach  since this trove of personal information wasn t stolen from Facebook s servers  Rather  it was given away freely to the maker of a Facebook personality quiz app called  thisisyourdigitallife  That app  which was developed by a University of Cambridge professor  collected data about the 270 000 people who installed it  along with data about their Facebook friends  totaling 50 million people in all  The professor  Aleksandr Kogan  then gave the data he had harvested to Cambridge Analytica Technically  only this last step violated Facebook s rules  which prohibit selling or giving away data collected by a third party app  The rest was business as usual  Third party apps collect vast amounts of detailed personal information about Facebook users every day  including their ages  location  pages they ve liked and groups they belong to  Users can opt out of sharing specific pieces of information  but it s unclear how many do This kind of broad data collection is not only allowed but encouraged by Facebook  which wants to keep developers happily building on top of its platform  Permissiveness is a feature  as they say  not a bug But in the wake of incidents like the data leak to Cambridge Analytica  some are questioning the costs of such loose policies on an influential platform with 2 2 billion registered users  It seems insane that you can make haphazard decisions about so many people s data   said Can Duruk  a technology consultant and software engineer  Facebook  he said  was  extremely lax with what kind of data they allowed people to get  In a Facebook post on Monday  Andrew Bosworth  a Facebook vice president  admitted that that thinking may have been a mistake  We thought that every app could be social   Mr  Bosworth wrote   Your calendar should have your events and your friends birthdays  your maps should know where your friends live  your address book should show their pictures  It was a reasonable vision but it didn t materialize the way we had hoped  An early clue about the potential for misuse of Facebook s third party developer tools came in 2010 when my colleague Emily Steel  then at The Wall Street Journal  reported that an online tracking company  RapLeaf  was collecting and reselling data it had gathered from third party Facebook apps to marketing firms and political consultants  In response  Facebook cut off RapLeaf s data access and said it would  dramatically limit  the misuse of its users  personal information by outside parties But preventing data hungry developers from exploiting Facebook s treasure trove of personal information remained challenging  In 2015  Facebook removed the ability of third party developers to collect detailed information about the friends of users who had installed an app  citing privacy concerns   Cambridge Analytica s data trove  which included this type of information  was gathered in 2014  before the change   Facebook has also taken away tools used by developers to create games and quizzes that barraged users with annoying notifications But the core functions of Facebook s open platform tool are still intact  There are still many third party apps like  thisisyourdigitallife  out there  vacuuming up intimate data about Facebook users  That data doesn t disappear  and Facebook has no real recourse to stop it from falling into the wrong hands Not all open data access is used irresponsibly  Researchers and nongovernmental organizations have used Facebook s third party development tools to respond to natural disasters  And many of the functions that internet users depend on   for example  the ability to import their digital address books into a new messaging app   are possible thanks only to the tools that allow for third party development known as application programming interfaces  or A P I s  Everything we depend on uses A P I s   said Kin Lane  a software engineer who maintains a website called API Evangelist   They re in your home  in your business  in your car  It s how these platforms innovate and do cool  interesting things  In Facebook s case  permissive data policies were also good for business  Third party developers built millions of apps on top of Facebook s platform  giving Facebook users more reasons to spend time on the site and generating more ad revenue for the company  Restricting access to data would limit Facebook s usefulness to developers and could drive them to build on a rival platform instead  making those products better In this context  it s even less surprising that Dr  Kogan and Cambridge Analytica were able to use a silly personality quiz to collect information about millions of Americans  After all  why else would the quiz be there

Good Thursday Here s what we re watching   Tariffs will test investors  resolve   Trump on Tariffs   If they charge us  we charge them    The stock market is proving Gary D  Cohn right   China tech stocks are also tumbling  Dropbox has priced its I P O Get this in your inbox each morning  Sign up here An unorthodox action by President Trump unsettles investors  but after a freakout  their optimism returns and the stock market moves higher But will investors shrug off President Trump s tariffs on China The stock market plunged Thursday after Mr  Trump announced the measures against China  Since mid February  when the Trump administration laid out its case for steel and aluminum tariffs  the S  P  500 is down 3 2 percent  The Dow Jones industrial average is off nearly 5 percent Until now  investors might have thought they could take Mr  Trump s trade pronouncements in stride  After all  many countries have won a reprieve from the steel and aluminum tariffs  And as Edward Alden of the Council on Foreign Relations wrote Thursday of the anti China measures   The administration is delaying the action to solicit comments from affected U S  companies  and it is quite possible the final tariffs will fall short of the threats  Just as the Trump administration has stepped back from quickly imposing the steel and aluminum tariffs  it may soften its stance if China suggests that its open to negotiations  The world could relax But China may not budge  As our colleague Steven Lee Myers reports  President Xi Jinping has so far managed to navigate Mr  Trump s rhetoric while maintaining a strong nationalist image at home  Yet Mr  Trump s tariff announcement  along with moves perceived by the Chinese as humiliating  may prompt China to retaliate with force Investors would then scramble to quantify the economic repercussions  They might not be terrible Some American companies  like computer chip makers  get substantial revenue from China  But on average  companies in the S  P  500 index derive a small share of their sales from the country And some investors may take a long view  believing that U S  companies have long been treated unfairly in China  A trade fight that eventually relaxes some of those disadvantageous conditions could bolster the long term prospects of those firms  And if the U S  is able to recruit other countries to its cause  China may relent Still  much could go wrong  A true test of investor sentiment will come if China fights back  Markets could fall further  creating a financial chain reaction that dampens the wider economy  A lot would depend on how Mr  Trump responds to Chinese actions  Would he up the ante  It s genuinely hard to predict how this will turn out   said Scott Kennedy  an expert in Chinese trade at the Center for Strategic and International Studies   whether one side will back down or whether it will spiral into a trade war    Peter EavisHere are the details   The data storage and collaboration company sold 36 million shares at  21 apiece  its expected range of  18 to  20 a share   At that price  the offering raised  756 million   At  21 a share  the company has a market value of gave Dropbox a market value of  9 2 billion The contextThe demand for Dropbox s shares suggests investors overcame any concern about daunting competition from the likes of Microsoft  Google and Amazon  all of which provide cloud storage services  A successful debut could pave the way for other unicorns to soon go public President Trump said he would impose about  60 billion worth of annual tariffs on Chinese imports as the White House moved to punish China for what it says is a pattern of co opting American technology and trade secrets and robbing companies of jobs and billions of dollars in revenue The tariffs will target 1 300 lines of Chinese goods   everything from shoes and clothing to electronics   the NYT reports administration officials said Mr  Trump  the officials added  will also direct the Treasury Department to impose restrictions on Chinese investment in American technology companies  a practice that they said the Chinese government uses to develop its own  national champions  in cutting edge industries like A I  and autonomous vehicles  The end objective of this is to get China to modify its unfair trade practices   Everett Eissenstat  the deputy director of the National Economic Council  told reporters Peter Navarro  the director of the White House National Trade Council and an architect of the measures  cast the tariffs as part of a seminal shift in how the U S  views China  Rather than trying to draw it into the rules based international economic order   a policy that dates back to Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger   the U S  now regards China as a strategic competitor  bent on eroding American security and prosperity   Mark Landler and Jim TankersleyBefore he said he was leaving his White House position earlier this month  Mr  Cohn reportedly warned that protectionist trade policies could jeopardize the stock rally that has taken place since Donald Trump became president  After Mr  Trump announced tariffs on steel and aluminum  the stock market slid  but soon recovered those losses  reassuring the president that his decision to introduce tariffs was right On Thursday  the Trump administration announced trade restrictions against China  The news appeared to weigh on markets  So  how have stocks done since important dates in the trade skirmish One important milestone was the Commerce Department s announcement last month that suggested the Trump administration was serious about introducing steel and aluminum tariffs  The S  P  500 index is down 2 3 percent since the day before that announcement  Mr  Trump actually announced plans for those tariffs on March 1  The S  P  500 is down 1 7 percent since Feb  28 The Dow Jones industrial average has done a lot worse  however  It is down 3 7 percent since the Commerce Department s announcement  and 3 1 percent since Mr  Trump announced his intentions  The decline encapsulated how trade tension might hurt specific businesses  in particular  Boeing s   Peter EavisMuch of the Dow s underperformance can be traced to the aircraft maker s stock The Trump administration s trade policies have hit Boeing  the most heavily weighted stock in the Dow  particularly hard Aluminum makes up about 80 percent of the weight of most commercial aircrafts  according to Brooke Sutherland and David Fickling of Gadfly  That means tariffs on imported aluminum would likely raise Boeing s costs more than its competitors  Boeing also views China  the main target of the Trump administration s protectionist trade policies  as an important growth market  The country is set to overtake the U S  as the biggest aviation market by 2022  Ms  Sutherland and Mr  Fickling write China could target Boeing if the country decides to retaliate against the U S Boeing is down 3 6 percent today  shaving more than 80 points off the blue chip index  Since the Commerce Department released its report calling for tariffs on imported steel and aluminum  the stock is down 8 7 percent  worth more than 200 points off the Dow Boeing drove the Dow higher for much of Mr  Trump s presidency  more than doubling during his first 12 months in office Boeing s climb has had an outsized impact on the Dow  The index is price weighted  meaning that the higher priced stocks have a bigger pull on the index MoneyBeat s Ben Eisen noted that at the end of January  the stock accounted for 9 4 percent of Dow  up from 6 percent a year earlier  By comparison  Boeing makes up just 0 8 percent of the market capitalization weighted S  P  500 Chinese tech stocks are also tumbling Shares of Alibaba are off 4 2 percent  Tencent 5 percent and Baidu 4 3 percent in the wake of the Trump administration s plan to impose about  60 billion worth of annual tariffs on Chinese imports That is much worse than their American counterparts  Amazon  Facebook and Google s parent Alphabet are down between 1 2 percent and 2 2 percent by comparison Shares of Baidu  Alibaba and Tencent   collectively known as BAT   have soared over the past year  pushing their combined market value above  1 trillion As these companies have grown  so have their ambitions  All three have moved to expand beyond their core business and home market and have aggressively invested in Americantech start ups to help them do so China s largest internet companies   the BAT plus the e commerce company JD com   have invested  5 6 billion in 48 tech deals in the United States over the past two years  according to CBI Insights data via CNBC Such investments have raised concerns in the United States  The Trump administration officials said the Chinese government uses these investments to develop its own  national champions  in cutting edge industries like A I  and autonomous vehicles  As part of the China tariffs  the Trump administration plans to place restrictions on Chinese investment in American technology companies Shrugging off hikes by the Federal Reserve and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority this week  the Bank of England maintained its key interest rate at 0 5 percent today Two members of the central bank s monetary policy committee called for an immediate rate

projection for inflation In the minutes from the committee s latest meeting  the central bank said that there had been  few surprises  in recent economic data and its February projections for inflation appeared  broadly on track   The bank said that the May inflation report would allow the committee to  undertake a fuller assessment of the underlying momentum in the economy  the degree of

When the Russia question came up during a hearing at the British Parliament last month  Alexander Nix did not hesitate  We ve never worked in Russia   said Mr  Nix  head of a data consulting firm that advised the Trump campaign on targeting voters  As far as I m aware  we ve never worked for a Russian company   Mr  Nix added   We ve never worked with a Russian organization in Russia or any other country  and we don t have any relationship with Russia or Russian individuals  But Mr  Nix s business did have some dealings with Russian interests  according to company documents and interviews Mr  Nix is a director of SCL Group  a British political and defense contractor  and chief executive of its American offshoot  Cambridge Analytica  which advised the Trump campaign  The firms  employees  who often overlap  had contact in 2014 and 2015 with executives from Lukoil  the Russian oil giant Lukoil was interested in how data was used to target American voters  according to two former company insiders who said there were at least three meetings with Lukoil executives in London and Turkey  SCL and Lukoil denied that the talks were political in nature  and SCL also said there were no meetings in London The contacts took place as Cambridge Analytica was building a roster of Republican clients in the United States   and harvesting the Facebook profiles of over 50 million users to develop tools to analyze voters  behavior Cambridge Analytica also included extensive questions about Russia s president  Vladimir V  Putin  in surveys it was carrying out in American focus groups in 2014  It is not clear what   or which client   prompted the line of questioning  which asked for views on topics ranging from Mr  Putin s popularity to Russian expansionism On two promotional documents obtained by The New York Times  SCL said it did business in Russia  In both documents  the country is highlighted on world maps that specify the location of SCL clients  with one of the maps noting that the clients were for the firm s elections division  In a statement  SCL said an employee had done  commercial work  about 25 years ago  for a private company in Russia  Cambridge Analytica has been a political flash point since its role in the Trump campaign attracted scrutiny after the election  While Mr  Nix s firm turned over some records to the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence during its investigation of Russian interference  Democrats on the committee want a fuller review   It is imperative to interview a broader range of individuals employed by or linked to Cambridge Analytica   they said in a report this month Asked about the Russian oil company  a spokesman for SCL said that in 2014 the firm s commercial division  discussed helping Lukoil Turkey better engage with its loyalty card customers at gas stations   The spokesman said SCL was not ultimately hired Arash Repac  chief executive of Lukoil Eurasia Petrol  offered a different explanation for the talks  He said that a meeting he attended with SCL in Turkey involved a promotional campaign with local soccer teams  We needed somebody to guide us with the customer data that we were collecting   he wrote in response to a question from The Times   Even though our campaign went ahead  we decided not to cooperate with SCL  No contracts were signed  But Christopher Wylie  who helped found Cambridge Analytica and develop the company s voter profiling technology  said Lukoil showed interest in how the company used data to tailor messaging to American voters  I remember being super confused   said Mr  Wylie  who took part in one of the Lukoil meetings  I kept asking Alexander   Can you explain to me what they want    he said  referring to Mr  Nix   I don t understand why Lukoil wants to know about political targeting in America   We re sending them stuff about political targeting   they then come and ask more about political targeting   Mr  Wylie said  adding that Lukoil  just didn t seem to be interested  in how the techniques could be used commercially Mr  Wylie  a former contractor  left SCL before the talks concluded and could not say what became of the relationship with the oil company  He had a falling out with SCL and tried to set up a rival business  SCL said he had violated a nondisclosure agreement and that his comments were an attempt to hurt the company A second person familiar with the discussions backed up Mr  Wylie s account  but spoke on the condition of anonymity because of a confidentiality agreement Though Lukoil is not state owned  it depends on Kremlin support  and its chief executive  Vagit Alekperov  has met with Mr  Putin on a number of occasions  Reuters reported last year that Lukoil and other companies received instructions from the state energy ministry on providing news stories favorable to Russian leadership 
 Good Monday  Here s what we re watching   Facebook s stock slides as lawmakers want answers on the latest controversy   Mark Zuckerberg is on the hot seat following the Cambridge Analytica revelations   Congress is racing to complete its spending bill   U S  companies warn President Trump about sweeping tariffs Get this in your inbox every morning  Sign up here Larry Ellison is the founder of Oracle and the 10th richest man on the planet  according to Forbes  Dr  David Agus is a best selling author and physician whose clients included Steve Jobs and Sumner Redstone Of all the companies the two could have started together  they ve chosen an unusual approach  a hydroponic farming start up focused on creating more healthful food Their new business  Sensei  formally unveiled itself Monday afternoon  wading into an industry that has become increasingly popular among investors Silicon Valley Start up Plenty raised  200 million from SoftBank s  100 billion Vision Fund  Bowery Farming  whose vegetables are now sold in a few grocery stores in New York City  has collected money from the likes of Google s venture arm and General Catalyst Sensei is focused more on wellness  While the company ultimately plans to expand into an array of businesses  its initial focus is on hydroponic farming  using software and sensors to monitor growing conditions   Its first farm is on Lanai  the Hawaiian island of which Mr  Ellison owns roughly 98 percent  Sensei s first batch of crops includes Black Trifele tomatoes and Komatsuna mustard greens  with its yardstick for production being nutrition per acre  So far  the conversation in agriculture has been dominated by productivity  How much food can we grow in a square foot  But scale is just part of the equation   Dr  Agus said in a statement   To properly nourish the world  we need to consider how nutritious that food is  This is where Sensei is focused  Its first customer is Hawaii  which imports the majority of its food  Sensei said that it can provide the state fresh food within 24 hours of harvesting  compared with over a week for imported vegetables But the company is also eager to tout its tech bona fides  Its farm runs off solar power provided by Tesla panels  And it claims to use just 10 percent of the water used in traditional farming methods  For so long  agriculture has been one of the least digitized industries   Daniel Gruneberg  Sensei s president  said in a statement   Now  we can combine software  sensors and robotics to make giant leaps in sustainable farming and perhaps  more importantly  the quality of our food    Michael de la MercedFacebook s stock had its worst day in about four years Shares of the social media giant finished down about 7 percent after the NYT reported that a political data firm with ties to 2016 Trump campaign harvested private information from over 50 million user profiles The news reports raised the specter of greater government scrutiny and potential regulatory action toward the technology sector  Already  government officials in the United States  Europe and elsewhere have been demanding tougher oversight of the world s largest tech companies  That  in turn  could erode the industry s profits and potentially force some companies to adjust their business models Facebook s stock is now down more than 12 percent from its all time high hit at the start of February  We think this episode is another indication of systemic problems at Facebook   said Brian Wieser  an analyst at New York based brokerage Pivotal Research Group Facebook s woes showed signs of spreading  too The S  P  500 tech sector is the worst performing of the index s 11 sectors Shares of Google parent Alphabet closed down about 3 2 percent  Amazon fell around 1 7 percent and Apple finished off 1 5 percent In all  Monday s slide wiped more than  80 billion off the market value of Facebook  Amazon  Netflix and Alphabet  Facebook accounted for more than  35 billion of that total  In fact  the company is no longer among the five biggest companies in the S  P  500 by market capitalization Fund flows added fuel to the selloff  MoneyBeat s Akane Otani reports that mutual funds and exchange traded funds tracking U S  technology stocks posted a record  2 6 billion in net inflows last week  according to data from fund tracker EPFR Global  That put year to date inflows at  47 5 billion Given the outsized role the tech sector has played in the aging bull market  its declines Monday dragged down the broader stock indexes The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 336 points  or 1 35 percent  while the S  P  500  was off nearly 39 points  or 1 42 percent Is Mark Zuckerberg s unusually powerful position at Facebook in part to blame for the latest backlash against the company The giant social media company is under the spotlight because a political data firm apparently misused information about more than 50 million Facebook users  Facebook is still facing questions about Russia linked accounts that had significant reach within the United States through the social network  In both cases  Facebook has struggled to show the public that it can get in front of its problems  Information about the Russia linked accounts came out piecemeal  and Facebook knew as early as 2015 that the political data firm had violated its data policies Mr  Zuckerberg at first downplayed concerns about Facebook s role in the 2016 presidential election  something he later said he regretted   His recent communications contain more high minded deliberation than hard discussion of the company s problems and how to deal with them These look like the reactions of a leader who thinks he is not going anywhere  Indeed  through his holding of special voting shares  Mr  Zuckerberg has an especially powerful position at Facebook that might shield him from the normal forces of accountability  C E O s without that protection might do more to tackle a big problem because it more directly threatens their job security Facebook  of course  has taken steps to address the abuse of its network  It has added hundreds of new employees to help police posts  and it has implemented artificial intelligence technology to spot material that falls afoul of the company s guidelines  Such initiatives cost money  Mr  Zuckerberg earlier this year said that such initiatives would have a significant impact on Facebook s profitability  Indeed  there s a strong argument to make that Mr  Zuckerberg s protected position will allow the company to press ahead with expensive investments in the face of any shareholder grumbling that may arise In the near term  though  it s hard to envision shareholders applying significant pressure on Facebook to be more responsive to the political and legal risks  They may believe Facebook s extraordinary profitability   its operating profits are roughly equivalent to 40 percent of its revenue   will help the stock ride what they see as a passing storm If governments propose restrictions on using members  data  Facebook s business model would be tested  The company s board  in theory  should press Mr  Zuckerberg for details on how he will deal with such shackles  But prominent board members like Marc L  Andreessen and Peter A  Thiel are skeptical of regulation  Facebook might be tempted to fight back Lawmakers may hold the line  however  sensing that the public has real concerns about the company  And if Facebook s responses look tardy and inadequate  the consequences could be harsh  as the fate of Wells Fargo  shows  Mr  Zuckerberg  in his uniquely dominant position  is the one person who can make sure this doesn t happen   Peter EavisLawmakers in the U S  and Britain want Mark Zuckerberg to explain how Cambridge Analytica  the political data firm founded by Steve Bannon and Robert Mercer  harvested private information from over 50 million user profiles  It s clear these platforms can t police themselves   tweeted Senator Amy Klobuchar  a Democratic member of the Senate Judiciary Committee What happened  The NYT and The Observer of London reported how Cambridge had collected data from an outside researcher to better target Facebook users  Christopher Wylie  who oversaw Cambridge s data collection until 2014  told the NYT of his former company   For them  this is a war  and it s all fair  Facebook argued that the incident wasn t a data breach and that Cambridge had committed a violation  But former Federal Trade Commission officials told the WaPo that Facebook may have violated a privacy pact reached with the regulator   The tech giant is reviewing whether one of its employees had been aware of the data leak  More on Cambridge Analytica  Alexander Nix  the company s chief  is facing scrutiny over business dealings with Russian interests  Mr  Wylie said that one Russian company  the oil giant Lukoil  appeared more interested in political message targeting than commercial uses  And Cambridge is reportedly trying to block the airing of a report by Channel 4  a British television channel  in which reporters went undercover at the firm Critic s cornerJeffrey Goldfarb of Breakingviews writes A woman in Tempe  Ariz   has died after being hit by a self driving car operated by Uber  in what appears to be the first known death of a pedestrian struck by an autonomous vehicle on a public road The Uber vehicle was in autonomous mode with a human safety driver at the wheel when it struck the woman  who was crossing the street outside of a crosswalk  the Tempe police said in a statement  The episode happened on Sunday around 10 p m  The woman was not publicly identified Uber said it had suspended testing of its self driving cars in Tempe  Pittsburgh  San Francisco and Toronto  Our hearts go out to the victim s family  We are fully cooperating with local authorities in their investigation of this incident   an Uber spokeswoman  Sarah Abboud  said in a statement The fatal crash will most likely raise questions about regulations for self driving cars  Testing of self driving cars is already underway for vehicles that have a human driver ready to take over if something goes wrong  but states are starting to allow companies to test cars without a person in the driver s seat  This month  California said that  in April  it would start allowing companies to test autonomous vehicles without anyone behind the wheel   Daisuke WakabayashiThe newspaper publisher announced Monday that Michael W  Ferro Jr   a Chicago entrepreneur and its biggest shareholder  has stepped down as the company s chairman  The move came just weeks after Mr  Ferro helped negotiate the sale of Tronc s crown jewel  The Los Angeles Times Justin Dearborn  the company s chief executive  will replace Mr  Ferro as chairman  I am confident that under the leadership of Justin and the rest of the board and management team Tronc will continue to deliver value for investors while executing the plan for digital transformation   Mr  Ferro said in a statement Mr  Ferro will remain an investor in Tronc  But his decision to step down as chairman follows a period of intense public scrutiny   Sydney EmberThe Long Term Stock Exchange hoping to popularize long term thinking as a corporate governance strategy has taken another step toward making its goal a reality The start up disclosed today that its partner  the IEX stock exchange  has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to let it apply its listing rules to the IEX The filing   which will commence the public part of the S E C  s review of the rule changes at IEX   advances the LTSE s aim of enshrining what it believes are best practices in running companies into corporate charters If the S E C approves the rules  it means that companies can go public using the LTSE principles  but also have their stocks trade on traditional exchanges like the N Y S E  and the Nasdaq like any other listing  That means these companies can get the liquidity they need along with the corporate governance structure that they want  according to the LTSE s founder  Eric Ries It also formalizes a tie up between LTSE and IEX  the exchange best known as the subject of Michael Lewis s  Flash Boys  What the principles include  Letting so called  citizens   or investors who plan on sticking with companies for the long term  eventually accumulate more voting power over the years than  tourists  who plan on sticking around for a shorter time   Blocking the use of certain kinds of compensation  including short term bonuses paid to executives based on metrics like reaching a certain milestone for quarterly earnings   Banning short term guidance   Having long term investors register their holdings with the company   The company will know effectively in real time who their long term investors are   Mr  Ries said   Reporting requirements that include disclosing earnings per share net of buybacks  to provide a more accurate way of measuring how a company is doing without factoring in financial engineering The context  Mr  Ries has spoken of the need to reward long term investors   Most of the listing standards are designed to align managers and long term shareholders   he told me   That frees up management to do what s right    It comes as companies continue to bemoan short term thinking in the stock markets that has C E O s focused more on meeting a quarter s targets than longer term goals   LTSE s goal is to eventually become a stock exchange on which companies list their shares  But for now  it wants to be allowed to create a special kind of listing for IEX that lets companies go public under its principles   LTSE also plans to promote itself as serving companies first and foremost and to make money more from listing fees and tools and services for its companies  rather than from trading offerings and data aimed at investors The caveatIt s a long road ahead  Not just for the rule change process  but also in convincing start ups to adopt these rules when they go public  What we have promised our venture investors is not that this is going to instantly transform the market overnight   Mr  Ries said   Michael de la MercedFriday is the deadline for lawmakers to pass a budget  and they are considering a plan that would cost more than  1

tactics  According to this view  the tariff proposal was a jarring move partly aimed at getting China to see that the U S  was serious about wanting to make trade with China fairer From a CNBC interview with Kevin Hassett  the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers Mr  Hassett s comments were in response to a WSJ article reporting that China and the U S  were quietly engaged in trade negotiations Investors seemed somewhat relieved  The stock market was up 1 5 percent on Monday  Of course  if the stakes are small enough  a deal may get done in the coming months that allows both sides to claim victory  But it seems unlikely that China would quickly agree to a far reaching overhaul of the rules that govern foreign investment in the country  a major area of dispute  Our colleagues Raymond Zhong and Paul Mozur showed the depth of the divide there Mr  Trump could up the ante if China shows no real signs that it will open up considerably  That could roil the markets again  The White House may want to signal that it can take market turmoil in stride  Mr  Hassett on Monday seemed to say that the White House expects market sell offs as it pursues its trade agenda  Rising risk premiums means investors require a better return on their stocks and bonds to cover higher risks  This usually involves a decline in price to make their returns look better to prospective buyers  Still  the more conciliatory tone from the White House after the sell off suggests there is not a strong desire for a full on trade war   Peter EavisThe stock is down 6 5 percent Monday morning as the Federal Trade Commission confirmed that it has opened an investigation into Facebook s privacy practice Also on Monday  Senator Chuck Grassley  Republican of Iowa and chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee  invited Mr  Zuckerberg to testify about privacy standards next month and also extended the invitation to Google s chief executive  Sundar Pichai  and Twitter s chief executive  Jack Dorsey Facebook s shares are down nearly 22 percent since its high in early February and off more than 18 percent since the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke more than a week ago To put Facebook s recent tumble in perspective  The stock is set for its worst monthly performance since August 2012  Over the past 10 days  Facebook has lost  100 billion in market value Despite the fall  Wall Street has not soured on Facebook  Forty four analysts have buy ratings on the stock  compare to just two who have sell ratings  according to Bloomberg The Apple C E O  said at the China Development Forum in Beijing that the government should tighten privacy regulations  after last week s revelations about Facebook and Cambridge Analytica Apple often uses privacy as a selling point  but Mr  Cook wasn t the only critic  Elon Musk deleted SpaceX and Tesla s Facebook pages  saying that the Tesla one  looks lame anyway   Sir Martin Sorrell of the ad giant WPP said Facebook needed to  step up to the mark  and be responsible for content on its platform  And some companies have stopped buying ads on Facebook  highlighting how advertisers want more transparency about performance   Users also complained that the Android app tracked calls and text messages  Meanwhile  Facebook took out full page ads in several British and American newspapers   including the NYT   for an apology signed by Mark Zuckerberg Elsewhere in Cambridge Analytica news  A volunteer for the campaign for Britain to leave the E U  said that a Canadian data company linked to Cambridge Analytica had played a role in the organization s work  Groups campaigning against Brexit have written to Prime Minister Theresa May demanding an investigation into what members of her cabinet and her staff knew Andrew s takeMr  Cook s points on privacy are absolutely right  But he has a tough needle to thread  given that Apple does business in China and acknowledges that it is  subject to each country s laws  that it does business in  Apple encrypts all user data and says there is no back door   and I believe that   most security and political experts have speculated that Beijing might ultimately be able to gain access iCloud data for Chinese customers  It adopted a law requiring all cloud services to be operated by Chinese companies  Apple says that it lobbied against the new law  but ultimately complied As for Facebook s ad  take note of this   We expect there are others  And when we find them  we will ban them and tell everyone affected   Settle in for more episodes before this soap opera ends Elsewhere in privacy  Growing calls for privacy could seriously dent the business model of ad supported internet  Federal law enforcement officials are renewing a push for a legal mandate that would allow access to encrypted data in criminal investigations The activist investor s fund  Third Point  has built a position in United Technologies  according to an antitrust filing He is the second activist investor to reveal a stake in the United Technologies during the past 30 days  On Feb  28  Bill Ackman told CNBC that his Pershing Square had a position in the defense contractor Context At a

Knauf disclosed in a filing on Monday that it had offered to buy USG for  42 a share  or about  6 billion  That marked a 25 percent premium to USG closing price on Friday In rejecting the offer  USG

with a 31 percent stake Berkshire had proposed an option for Knauf to buy Berkshire s stake in USG  according to the filing  The option would be exercisable only if Knauf bought all of USG s shares

As Silicon Valley experiences a wave of criticism  even some former colleagues are becoming adversaries Another prominent skeptic spoke out this week  as a creator of one of Facebook s top products waded into criticism of the internet giant  It is time   deletefacebook   wrote Brian Acton  one of the founders of WhatsApp  wrote on Twitter  His company was bought by Facebook for  19 billion in 2014  The deal made him a billionaire Mr  Acton s anti Facebook message  retweeted more than 10 000 times  captured a moment in the tech industry when even some of its best known people are publicly calling for change  The chorus has grown louder this week  as Facebook faces questions over how it allowed a political consulting firm  Cambridge Analytica  to obtain data on 50 million users  The question is   What are you loyal to    said Tristan Harris  a former Google employee who has started The Center for Humane Technology  an organization for Silicon Valley workers who want to change corporate culture  He has been critical of social media companies for creating addictive products that inflame cultural tensions  Are you more loyal to your company   Mr  Harris said   Or are you more loyal to protecting the fabric of our society  The tech defections have accelerated in recent months  especially for Facebook Justin Rosenstein  the creator of the Facebook  like  button  deleted the product from his phone and spoke out about the industry using psychologically manipulative advertising  Chamath Palihapitiya  Facebook s former head of user growth  said in December that the company was  ripping apart the social fabric of how society works   And Sandy Parakilas  a former Facebook platform operations manager  wrote on Tuesday in The Washington Post that Mark Zuckerberg  Facebook s chief executive  must  be held accountable for the negligence of his company  Loyalty to a company is beginning to crack because many tech workers are being asked to build or defend products they question  Mr  Harris said  His center is making resources for engineers on how to build more ethical products and starting an educational campaign  called  The Truth About Tech   in 55 000 American schools  More people are speaking up because they feel like they ve been told lies   Mr  Harris said   You can t just repeat   We re making the world more open  over and over and over again while democracy is burning  Silicon Valley companies have long prized secrecy and loyalty among their workers  who often exercise  play sports and eat three meals a day together  Facebook especially is known for its tight knit community  Each employee has an annual  Faceversary  on his or her hire date  a ritual that within the company is seen as deeply meaningful and is usually accompanied by balloons  Until very recently  it was taken as a given that tech equaled progress and tech equaled good and tech equaled economic strength   said Leslie Berlin  the author of Troublemakers  a history of Silicon Valley She said the defections she sees now are historically unique  The Valley was founded on this notion of   We re very open     Ms  Berlin said   But the secrecy has always been there   It s been pretty much a straight line since the start of the Cold War until now   she said   This is something new  Employees may feel the freedom to rebel because of Silicon Valley s success  both technologically and financially  The technology platforms have become more powerful   and the fortunes much bigger   than the programmers ever expected  So while the industry s power disturbs them  the wealth allows them to speak out without fear of retribution  Ms  Berlin said  It s the shadow of the success   she said   You have to understand them together  Certainly  not everyone is critical  Mr  Acton s WhatsApp co founder  Jan Koum  is on the Facebook board of directors and remains deeply active on the platform  regularly posting pro President Trump and anti immigration news And when former leaders have spoken out with criticisms of Facebook  the company has often responded aggressively  They do yell   said Roger McNamee  an early investor and adviser to Mark Zuckerberg  referring to Facebook leadership s approach But the culture of fear that the company has fostered among employees is not working anymore  he said  Facebook is at one of those moments where everybody who works there has to ask which side of history do you want to be on   Mr  McNamee said   The facts are not only indisputable  they re not even complete  It s going to get worse  
Good Tuesday  Here s what we re watching    What to expect from Powell s first Fed meeting   Trump  tariffs and the G20   Pressure continues to mount on Facebook   Facebook had a terrible day   So did Uber   Leaders at the G 20 summit are still trying to avert a trade war Get this in your inbox each morning  Sign up here Federal Reserve policymakers conclude their March rate setting meeting on Wednesday  It is the first such session with Jerome H  Powell as the central bank s new chairman With the job market tight and inflation picking up only gradually  the Fed is widely expected to raise rates by a quarter of a percentage point in what is likely to be the first of three rate increases this year After the meeting  Mr  Powell will hold his first news conference in his new role  where observers will be listening closely for any suggestion that the Fed might depart from its anticipated path  and  if so  why Here s a look at what economists and money managers are expecting Jan Hatzius  Goldman Sachs   Public remarks by Fed officials suggest a broad shift in the committee s outlook towards a potentially faster pace of tightening  and we expect the median dot to show four hikes in 2018  up from three at the December meeting  Additional hawkish changes a move to three hikes in 2019 or an increase in the longer run funds rate estimates are also possible but not our base case  Michelle Meyer  Bank of America Merrill Lynch  Ms  Meyer says she expects the Fed raise rates this meeting  but  unlike December where there were two dissents  we expect this decision to be unanimous given the shift in voters this year in the hawkish direction  The focus will be on the evolution of the dots  we look for the median to hold at three hikes for this year  but to shift up from two to three hikes in 2019  We also think the long run dot will edge up to 2 875   This would show a Fed that is more confident about its ability to deliver rate hikes  but without an urgency to front load the tightening  Ian Shepherdson  Pantheon Macroeconomics  Mr  Powell  is bound to be faced with questions along the lines of  Why are you not raising the dots in the wake of the substantial  unfunded fiscal easing    His reply  we suspect  will be something like   It s not our job to tell Congress how to conduct fiscal policy  and it s too soon to assess the impact of the tax cuts and spending increases  Much of the easing of policy could be saved rather than spent  and there are encouraging signs that productivity is picking up  so any upturn in wage growth as a result of fiscal loosening need not necessarily generate higher inflation  In any event  with inflation well below target  gradual normalization is the best way to balance the risks of both future inflation and the premature ending of the cycle via excessive tightening  Stephen Stanley  Amherst Pierpont   The bulk of the interest in this week s F O M C  meeting will come from the updated dot and economic projections as well as any meaningful tweaks to the key elements of the F O M C  statement  Any changes to the dots and statement language are likely to be in the hawkish direction  though I would expect that the new information will be more evolutionary than a radically different  Steve Rick  CUNA Mutual Group  There is  a very strong case for not only raising rates this week  but potentially doing so in a more aggressive manner than previously forecasted at the end of 2017  I think we could see projections get updated to call for four hikes instead of three  with plans for lifting rates more in coming years as well  Chris Zaccarelli  Independent Advisor Alliance   Whether we have 3 or 4 rate hikes this year shouldn t be that big of a difference to the economy  but it WILL have a big impact on market prices and market psychology  Every statement   whether spoken or written   will be highly scrutinized looking for clues as to whether the Fed Funds rate will be 1  higher  or only 75 bps  a year from now  President Trump s plan to hit countries around the world with stiff tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum has dominated a gathering of world economic leaders amid fears that the United States is on the cusp of starting an international trade war On Monday  Steven Mnuchin  the United States Treasury secretary  was peppered with requests from several countries for exemptions from the tariffs  which are being imposed in the name of national security In an interview on the sidelines of the meeting  Mr  Mnuchin suggested exemptions to the tariffs could be announced  relatively quickly  Mr  Mnuchin said Mr  Trump has already said he would exempt Canada and Mexico from the tariffs upon a successful renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement  and he has indicated that other countries could also get exemptions  But the United States has yet to detail exactly what would qualify a country for an exemption  other than a vague reference to protecting the United States  national security and reducing bilateral trade deficits Countries including France  Argentina and South Korea pressed Mr  Mnuchin on Monday about being freed from the metals tariffs  arguing that  as United States allies  they should not be penalized on national security grounds  Mr  Mnuchin said that decisions were being made on a case by case basis and that there was not a one size fits all approach to deciding which countries would be exempt  The tariffs go into effect on Friday   Alan RappeportThe Federal Trade Commission has opened an investigation into whether Facebook violated an agreement with the agency on data privacy  reports Cecilia Kang of the NYT The probe comes after reports that information on 50 million users was improperly obtained by the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica  according to a person with knowledge of the inquiry The investigation  started in recent days  adds to the mounting pressureagainst Facebook in the United States and in the United Kingdom about its handling of the data  Cambridge Analytica used the information to help President Trump s presidential campaign profile voters during the 2016 election The F T C  and Facebook reached a settlement in 2011 after the agency accused the company of deceiving customers  by telling them they could keep their information on Facebook private  and then

WASHINGTON   For 10 days  Mark Zuckerberg  Facebook s chief executive  has been under increasing pressure from lawmakers and regulators to answer questions about the improper harvesting of data of 50 million Facebook users by a British political consulting firm  Cambridge Analytica Now Mr  Zuckerberg plans to go to Washington to explain himself The chief executive has agreed to testify in at least one congressional hearing over the social network s handling of customer data  according to people familiar with the decision  Specifically  he plans to appear next month before the House Energy and Commerce Committee  said the people  who asked not to be identified because the arrangements were not public  Mr  Zuckerberg may make other appearances  he has also been asked to testify before the Senate and House Judiciary and Commerce Committees His appearing on Capitol Hill could create a spectacle that is replayed online and on television for years to come  especially amid a backlash against the power of tech behemoths  Late last year  executives from Facebook  Google and Twitter showed up at congressional hearings to discuss Russian meddling online in the 2016 presidential election  putting faces to the tech platforms during criticism of their misuse Congressional testimony by Silicon Valley chief executives is rare  and their appearances have each set off a media circus  In 2013  Apple s chief executive  Timothy D  Cook  addressed senators about his company s tax practices  In 2011  Google s chairman at the time  Eric Schmidt  spoke about the company s search practices in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee  And in 1998  Bill Gates  who was Microsoft s chief executive  defended his company against lawmakers  assertions that he was building a monopoly   an argument he eventually lost in court  The committee is continuing to work with Facebook to determine a day and time for Mr  Zuckerberg to testify   said Elena Hernandez  a spokeswoman for the House Energy and Commerce Committee CNN earlier reported that Mr  Zuckerberg had decided to testify in front of Congress He has been under pressure to appear before Congress since reports on March 17 that Cambridge Analytica improperly obtained and used the data of 50 million Facebook users  The revelations immediately sparked a furor on both sides of the Atlantic  with regulators in Britain and the United States calling for Mr  Zuckerberg to discuss what happened Those calls haven t subsided  even though the chief executive issued a public statement last week outlining the steps that Facebook was taking to prevent improper  harvesting of the data of its 2 2  billion users  On Monday  the Federal Trade Commission confirmed that it was investigating how Facebook handles information about its users  Politicians including Senator Charles E  Grassley  Republican of Iowa  have also pressed for Mr  Zuckerberg to appear on Capitol Hill Mr  Zuckerberg has turned down some requests to go before lawmakers  He declined to appear this week before the British Parliament and answer questions about data privacy Facebook staff have held marathon meetings and phone calls with staff from congressional committees over the past week  according to Facebook employees and others briefed on the matter  Rob Sherman  Facebook s deputy chief privacy officer  and Molly Cutler  its associate general counsel  have met with staff from the House and Senate Commerce  Judiciary and Intelligence Committees  they said Mr  Zuckerberg initially resisted speaking to Congress  and had asked if a senior Facebook executive could be sent to represent the company in his name  two Facebook employees familiar with the conversations said After the public outcry over Facebook s data and privacy settings  Mr  Zuckerberg was persuaded that he needed to appear  they said  In recent days  he told Facebook employees that he had come to understand he would have to testify In an interview with CNN last week  Mr  Zuckerberg said that he would be  happy to  testify in front of Congress and that  it s the right thing to do   He added of Cambridge Analytica   This was a major breach of trust  and I m really sorry that this happened  Google and Twitter have also been called to testify before Congress on data privacy  The companies didn t respond to requests for comment Lawmakers have been frustrated in the past by Mr  Zuckerberg s absence from hearings  Last year  Facebook sent its general counsel  Colin Stretch  to join lawyers from Twitter and Google to testify about social media s role in spreading disinformation during the 2016 election  Lawmakers noted the absence of senior executives  including Mr  Zuckerberg  and repeatedly challenged Facebook to send its leaders to answer questions In a recent interview  Senator John Kennedy  Republican of Louisiana  said Mr  Zuckerberg needed to directly answer questions from Congress about what kind of user data was being gathered and shared  because Facebook has been too vague about its practices  He said the attorneys for Facebook  Google and Twitter who testified about the 2016 election had  dodged questions   They didn t say a damn thing  which was what they were paid to do   Mr  Kennedy said   I d encourage Mr  Zuckerberg to do the common sense thing and roll up his sleeves and take a meaningful amount of time talking to us about this  
WASHINGTON   Federal regulators and state prosecutors are opening investigations into Facebook  Politicians in the United States and Europe are calling for its chief executive  Mark Zuckerberg  to testify before them  Investors have cut the value of the social networking giant by about  50 billion in the past two days They are all focused on the same thing  whether Facebook mishandled users  data Facebook has built its highly profitable social network off its users  selling advertisements based on their ages  interests and other details  But the scrutiny over the company s vast trove of personal data   following a report that a political consulting firm had improperly obtained information of 50 million users   is taking direct aim at that lucrative formula  Investors are reacting to fears of regulation and the consequences of regulation   said Brian Wieser  a senior research analyst at Pivotal Research Group   The scale of errors can only lead one to conclude these are systemic problems  So far  most of the social network s top executives have been silent  Mr  Zuckerberg  its founder  and Sheryl Sandberg  his top deputy  have not made any public statements in recent days  The pair did not appear at an employee meeting on Tuesday in Menlo Park  Calif   where the company is based At the meeting  employees asked questions about the continuing internal investigation into the use of Facebook data by the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica  The firm  which was tied to President Trump s 2016 campaign  used the data to target messages to voters The meeting  which included Facebook s deputy counsel  Paul Grewal  largely focused on the steps that Facebook was taking to ensure its data could no longer be misused by independent researchers  according to Facebook employees in attendance  Mr  Zuckerberg was expected to address employees on Friday  when the company holds an all hands meeting The company has faced internal dissent over its broader role in spreading disinformation during the presidential campaign and its response to it  The tensions have prompted the planned departure of Alex Stamos  Facebook s chief security officer  who plans to leave in August The pressure on Facebook has been building for years It started in the European Union  where regulators have taken an aggressive attitude toward Facebook and other American technology giants for their sway over the region s 500 million people  The company has been the subject of several privacy investigations and charges by European regulators  Europe has approved a new privacy law  which takes effect in May  that will give users of Facebook  Google and other internet services more control over how their data is collected and what Silicon Valley companies know about them After the 2016 presidential campaign  lawmakers at home joined the chorus of critics  citing the company s role in Russia s disinformation efforts  The social network was one of the top tools used by Russians to spread false news  and the company s executives have struggled to explain what happened and how they would prevent foreign interference in the future The Cambridge Analytica revelations have forced Facebook to scramble to assuage fresh concerns by regulators and lawmakers  The company is sending its representatives to Capitol Hill and arranging conversations with state attorneys general to try to answer questions about how the firm collected the information of Facebook users The social networking giant is also facing an investigation by the Federal Trade Commission  which is looking into whether Facebook violated an agreement with the agency  according to a person with knowledge of the inquiry The F T C  investigation is connected to a settlement the agency reached with Facebook in 2011 after finding that the company had told users that third party apps on the social media site  like games  would not be allowed to access their data  But the apps  the agency found  were able to obtain almost all personal information about a user The current investigation has parallels  The information on the 50 million users was harvested in 2014 by an outside researcher  Aleksandr Kogan  Mr  Kogan  a professor at Cambridge University  paid users small sums to take a personality quiz and download an app  which collected private information from their profiles and from those of their friends  Facebook allowed that sort of data collection at the time Then  Mr  Kogan gave the information to Cambridge Analytica  a firm founded by Stephen K  Bannon  the former White House political adviser  and Robert Mercer  the wealthy Republican donor  Passing the information to a third party violated Facebook s policies  the company said last week  There are all sorts of obligations under the consent decree that may not have been honored here   said David Vladeck  a former director of consumer protection at the F T C The company could face fines of  40 000 a day per violation if the agency finds that Facebook broke the agreement  We are aware of the issues that have been raised but cannot comment on whether we are investigating   an F T C  spokeswoman said in a statement on Tuesday   We take any allegations of violations of our consent decrees very seriously  Facebook said it expected to receive questions from the F T C  related to potential violations of the 2011 consent decree   We remain strongly committed to protecting people s information   Facebook s deputy chief privacy officer  Rob Sherman  said in a statement   We appreciate the opportunity to answer questions the F T C  may have  The F T C  inquiry is just one piece of the regulatory backlash  On Tuesday  the New York attorney general  Eric T  Schneiderman  announced that he was joining the Massachusetts attorney general  Maura Healey  in an investigation into whether Facebook had failed to protect the privacy of users in those states  New Jersey s attorney general announced a similar investigation Mr  Schneiderman and Ms  Healey sent a letter to Facebook on Tuesday that demanded records of the communications between the company and Cambridge Analytica  Consumers have a right to know how their information is used   and companies like Facebook have a fundamental responsibility to protect their users  personal information   Mr  Schneiderman said   Today s demand letter is the first step in our joint investigation to get to the bottom of what happened  There have also been growing calls for the top leadership at Facebook to appear before American and British lawmakers to testify about the company and Cambridge Analytica Senators Amy Klobuchar  Democrat of Minnesota  and John Kennedy  Republican of Louisiana  have asked the chairman of the Judiciary Committee  Charles E  Grassley  Republican of Iowa  to hold a hearing  Republican leaders of the Senate Commerce Committee  organized by John Thune of South Dakota  wrote a letter on Monday to Mr  Zuckerberg demanding answers to questions about how the data had been collected and if users were able to control the misuse of data by third parties  It s time for Mr  Zuckerberg and the other C E O s to testify before Congress   Senator Mark Warner  Democrat of Virginia  said on Tuesday   The American people deserve answers about social media manipulation in the 2016 election  Facebook staff members were scheduled to brief the office of Mr  Warner  the top Democrat on the Intelligence committee  and the offices of members of other committees  including Commerce  this week  The possibility that Facebook has either not been transparent with consumers or has not been able to verify that third party app developers are transparent with consumers is troubling   Mr  Thune said in his letter On Tuesday morning  a committee within the British Parliament sent a letter to Mr  Zuckerberg that asked him to appear before the panel to answer questions on the company s connection to Cambridge Analytica  The president of the European Parliament also requested an appearance by Mr  Zuckerberg  The committee has repeatedly asked Facebook about how companies acquire and hold on to user data from their site  and in particular about whether data had been taken without their consent   wrote Damian Collins  chairman of the British committee   Your officials  answers have consistently understated this risk  and have been misleading to the committee  
In the wake of news that the Facebook data of 50 million people was obtained by Cambridge Analytica  a political data firm  many users are mulling whether it is time to leave the social network  Even a co founder of WhatsApp  which Facebook bought for  16 billion in 2014  declared that it was time to delete Facebook But while deleting your account is as simple as clicking on a few buttons  Facebook may be too ubiquitous to truly quit  For one  it would probably be inaccurate to say you have removed Facebook from your life just by leaving the site  Chances are you still use WhatsApp  the largest messaging app in the world  or Instagram  the most popular photo sharing app  Facebook owns both Keep in mind that Facebook isn t the only company capable of collecting your information  One big culprit  Web trackers  like cookies embedded into websites and their ads  They are everywhere  and they follow your activities from site to site You can quit Facebook if you simply find no joy in it  But if you re looking to leave for philosophical reasons concerning privacy  it s a futile effort  You may be better off tweaking your privacy settings on the site Here are some answers to questions that many people are posing to The New York Times via social media What are the alternatives to using Facebook  Instagram and WhatsApp There is no real substitute for Facebook if you re looking for a social network that includes virtually everyone you meet in real life  Social networks are all about the people on them  and Facebook has more than 2 billion monthly users  You could consider Snapchat  which has about 187 million daily users  but it s a far different experience   you primarily use it to send photos that self destruct   with an interface that many people find confusing There are plenty of alternatives to WhatsApp  But they have drawbacks and aren t as far reaching as WhatsApp  which has more than 1 5 billion monthly users Signal is a solid app for secure encrypted messaging   but it is still a young service with a relatively small number of users  You might be able to get hundreds of your friends to join Signal  But chances are you have friends or family in other countries  and WhatsApp is the go to messaging service internationally  For example  practically every smartphone user in India   more than 200 million people   uses WhatsApp Another WhatsApp alternative is WeChat  a Chinese messaging app that has about a billion monthly users  But the majority of people on that service are in China  And WeChat faces its own privacy issues because of China s notorious reputation for mass surveillance  Tencent  the company that runs WeChat  denies that it stores the chat histories of its users  But WeChat users have been arrested over conversations they have had in the app  and chat transcripts have been used as evidence in court proceedings Instagram  which has more than 800 million monthly users  is also a tough one  giving Facebook a stranglehold on photo sharing  The only real competitor to Instagram is Facebook itself  which has its own photo sharing features  Remember Flickr  The Yahoo owned site is the closest thing either has to a competitor  and it s like a graveyard of people s digital memories before they abandoned it for Facebook and Instagram Google Photos is a compelling service  but it is a photo album management tool  not so much a social network How else do you keep in touch with friends and family  How do you create and discover events  How do you market and manage customer service for your small business  How do you spark and build grass roots movements Facebook is the one stop shop to accomplish all those tasks  But if you have the patience  you can juggle multiple apps to cobble together the same experience Messaging apps are popular for keeping in touch with friends and family   a group chat between family members via text message  for example  is still an efficient way to keep in touch  And sites like MeetUp are designed for hosting and discovering events As for customer service  many companies use Twitter to engage with their customers and resolve complaints  Yelp  the reviews site for local businesses  is a common place for customers to talk about their experiences  and business owners often engage with people there For grass roots movements  a Twitter hashtag might be enough  Recent examples include  metoo  the movement for people to discuss sexual assault   deleteuber  the campaign to protest Uber last year amid political controversy  and now  there is the movement to  deletefacebook in response to the Cambridge Analytica controversy What does it mean to delete Facebook  How can you actually delete your account You can permanently delete your account by clicking a few buttons on Facebook s website  The company delays deletion for a few days  so do not log back in  Facebook also offers a tool for extracting a copy of your data before deleting your account After you delete your account  it won t be recoverable  But there are caveats Shadows of your digital self would remain on the site  For example  if people uploaded photos of you  those photos will still be there  The conversations you had with friends through Facebook won t disappear  either When you delete your account  you are only deleting the media you posted  like your status updates and photos that you uploaded  That s not going to do much for your privacy  considering that an overwhelming amount of what you do on Facebook involves engaging with other people  All of your friends  and their friends  too  would also have to delete their accounts in order to have any sort of meaningful effect What other things are you losing access to if you delete Facebook  Why do so many apps require a Facebook login One painful part of breaking up with Facebook would be potentially losing access to the many third party apps and websites that are tied to your account  Over the past decade  many shopping sites and apps teamed up with Facebook to use the company s login tool  Facebook Login Facebook Login became popular because it was a good product  By clicking a button  you could sign up for an account with an app or website just by sharing your Facebook account data  That allowed you to skip manually entering details like your name and email address   a process that is especially cumbersome on a small smartphone screen  This sped up the process of signing up for an account to buy that pair of shoes you saw go on sale If you were to delete Facebook  you would break your access to many sites and apps that you signed up for using Facebook Login  But fortunately  many sites and apps still let you sign up for accounts directly through them  and many also let you log in through your Google account It s not impossible to delete Facebook  But it would be a long and tedious process to create new accounts for all the apps and sites you use Where does Facebook really equal the internet Keep in mind that Facebook reaches well beyond the United States  As my colleague Sheera Frenkel noted on Twitter  deleting Facebook is a privilege  In some parts of the world  like Myanmar  Egypt and Indonesia  people rely on Facebook as a primary means to conduct business and stay in touch with friends and family  In Africa  Facebook has struck deals that offer basic services   centered on those provided by Facebook   to residents for free 
LONDON    The computer expert who alleges a trove of Facebook data was improperly used to help Donald Trump s White House bid said Tuesday that he strongly believes the information was also used by the Brexit movement that persuaded Britain to quit the European Union In a 3  hour hearing  Chris Wylie told the House of Commons media committee that he believes the breach exceeded the 50 million Facebook users reported earlier   though he didn t give an exact figure  And he said the data compiled by the political consulting business Cambridge Analytica was available to other firms with links to it  All kinds of people had access to the data   said Wylie  who helped develop Cambridge Analytica s methods for using the information to target and persuade voters   It was everywhere  Among the companies that had access to the data was AggregateIQ  a Canadian political consultant that did work for Vote Leave  the official campaign backing Britain s withdrawal from the EU  Wylie said Wylie described Cambridge Analytica as just one arm of a global company  SCL Group  that gets most of its income from military contracts but is also a political gun for hire  often in countries where democratic institutions are weak  He suggested the company combines computer algorithms and dirty tricks to help candidates win regardless of the cost The 28 year old Canadian with a swath of pink hair says he helped set up Cambridge Analytica in 2013  He left the next year Wylie has previously alleged that Cambridge Analytica used personal data improperly collected from Facebook users to help Trump s 2016 presidential campaign Cambridge Analytica says none of the Facebook data was used in its work on the Trump campaign  It denies any wrongdoing Cambridge Analytica s acting CEO  Alexander Tayler  said in a statement that Wylie was a part time contractor who  has no direct knowledge of our work or practices  since he left the company Wylie said he  absolutely  believes AggregateIQ drew on Cambridge Analytica s databases for its work on the Brexit campaign  In the closely fought referendum in 2016  51 9 percent of voters backed Britain s departure from the EU  I think it is incredibly reasonable to say that AIQ played a very significant role in Leave winning   Wylie said He testified that AggregateIQ was formed when Cambridge Analytica sought to expand but Canadians he wanted to bring into the business didn t want to relocate to Britain  The two firms shared underlying technology and worked so closely together that Cambridge Analytica staff often referred to the Canadian firm as a  department   he said Because of the links between the two companies  Vote Leave got the  the next best thing  to Cambridge Analytica when it hired AggregateIQ   a company that can do virtually everything that  Cambridge Analytica  can do but with a different billing name   Wylie said AggregateIQ  based in Victoria  British Columbia  issued a statement saying it has never been part of Cambridge Analytica or SCL  AggregateIQ works in full compliance within all legal and regulatory requirements in all jurisdictions where it operates   the company said   All work AggregateIQ does for each client is kept separate from every other client  Wylie s testimony came a day after Wylie and two other former insiders presented 50 pages of documents that they said proved Vote Leave violated election finance rules during the referendum campaign They allege that Vote Leave circumvented spending limits by donating 625 000 pounds   888 000  to the pro Brexit student group BeLeave  which then sent the money directly to AggregateIQ Vote Leave denies breaking any campaign finance regulations  Dominic Cummings  the Vote Leave strategist  called Wylie a  fantasist charlatan  
LONDON    A Cambridge Analytica whistleblower said on Tuesday that Canadian company AggregateIQ worked on software called Ripon which was used to identify Republican voters ahead of the 2016 U S  presidential election AggregateIQ did not immediately respond to request for comment on the remarks by Christopher Wylie  a whistleblower formerly of British political consultancy Cambridge Analytica Wylie has previously disclosed how users  data from Facebook was used by Cambridge Analytica to help elect U S  President Donald Trump Ripon  the town in which the Republican Party was founded in 1854  was the name given to a tool that let a campaign manage its voter database  target specific voters  conduct canvassing  manage fundraising and carry out surveys  There s now tangible proof in the public domain that AIQ actually built Ripon  which is the software that utilised the algorithms from the Facebook data   Wylie told the British Parliament s Digital  Culture  Media and Sport Committee AggregateIQ told Reuters on March 24 that it had never been and is not a part of Cambridge Analytica nor ever entered into a contract with Cambridge Analytica It said it works in full compliance within all legal and regulatory requirements and had never knowingly been involved in any illegal activity Cambridge Analytica said on Tuesday that it had not shared any of the Facebook profile data procured by a Cambridge academic with AggregateIQ  It said it had not had any communication with AggregateIQ since December 2015  Reporting by Alistair Smout  Andy Bruce and Eric Auchard  editing by Guy Faulconbridge

 Reuters    The European Commission pressed Facebook on Monday over whether EU citizens  data were among those improperly harvested by a British political consultancy  after the U S  regulator said it was investigating the firm s privacy practices That piled yet more pressure on a firm that has lost more than  100 billion in market value in the last 10 days Facebook shares fell more than 5 percent on Monday after the U S  consumer protection regulator made public its investigation of how the social network allowed data of 50 million users to get into the hands of Cambridge Analytica Facebook executives have apologized after reports emerged that Cambridge Analytica had used personal data to target U S  voters  Have any data of EU citizens been affected by the recent scandal   EU Justice Commissioner Vera Jourova wrote in a letter to Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg  seen by Reuters   If this is the case  how do you intend to inform the authorities and users about it  Jourova said that statements by Facebook executives had not alleviated her concerns  This is particularly disappointing given our efforts to build a relationship based on trust with you and your colleagues     this trust is now diminished  A Facebook spokeswoman said the company remained strongly committed to protecting people s information and appreciated  the opportunity to explain what we know and will respond to the questions that the Commissioner has asked  Jourova asked Sandberg whether she was certain that a similar situation could  not be repeated today  and if she thought stricter rules were needed for platforms  like those that exist for traditional media   As Mark Zuckerberg said this week  we are working hard to tackle past abuse  prevent future abuse and give people more prominent controls   the Facebook spokeswoman said Germany s justice minister called for stricter rules for Facebook after meeting with company executives on Monday who said around 1 percent of 300 000 users of a personality quiz whose results were later fed into Cambridge Analytica s voter targeting algorithms were in Europe Jourova said she wanted a reply to her letter within two weeks The Cambridge Analytica scandal emerged only a few months before a landmark EU data protection law comes into force under which companies found to be in breach could be fined up to 4 percent of global turnover Any eventual sanctions for Facebook will fall under the current privacy regulations  and so would be much lower Britain s data watchdog is taking the lead in investigating Facebook and Cambridge Analytica from the European side  and Jourova said she expected the social network to cooperate fully with European data protection authorities  Reporting by Julia Fioretti  Editing by Andrew Roche and David Evans

Facebook said it would roll out a centralized system for its users to control their privacy and security settings in response to an outcry over the way it has handled personal data The system  which will be introduced to Facebook users globally over the coming weeks  will allow people to change their privacy and security settings from one place rather than having to go to roughly 20 separate sections across the social media platform From the new page  users can control the personal information the social network keeps on them  such as their political preferences or interests  and download and review a file of data Facebook has collected about them  Facebook also will clarify what types of apps people are currently using and what permissions those apps have to gather their information Facebook began developing the centralized system last year but sped it up after revelations that a British political consulting firm  Cambridge Analytica  improperly harvested the information of 50 million users of the social network  The amount of data Cambridge Analytica obtained about Facebook users reawakened fears over how much information the social network has gathered about people  leading to a  DeleteFacebook movement and other criticism  The last week showed how much more work we need to do to enforce our policies  and to help people understand how Facebook works and the choices they have over their data   Erin Egan  Facebook s chief privacy officer  and Ashlie Beringer  a Facebook deputy general counsel  said in a statement announcing the new system   We ve heard loud and clear that privacy settings and other important tools are too hard to find  and that we must do more to keep people informed  The Cambridge Analytica scandal has plunged Facebook into its worst crisis in years  with regulators and lawmakers in the United States and Britain demanding answers about how the social network deals with data privacy  Mark Zuckerberg  Facebook s chief executive  has agreed to appear in front of lawmakers on Capitol Hill next month  people familiar with the decision have said Last week  Mr  Zuckerberg said in a statement that Facebook had to do better with user data and promised to roll out products that give users more control over their information and privacy settings  One of our biggest responsibilities is to protect data   he told The New York Times last week   Whenever there s an issue where someone s data gets passed to someone who the rules of the system shouldn t have allowed it to  that s rightfully a big issue and deserves to be a big uproar Late Wednesday  Facebook also said that it was halting its practice of allowing advertisers to target ads using information from third party data brokers  These are business to business companies that can collect a vast range of details about individual consumers such as their shopping habits  health concerns  income range and preferred credit card The social network had previously allowed advertisers to use consumer details from data brokers like Experian  Acxiom and Oracle s Datalogix unit to help target ads to Facebook users  But Facebook said it was now mothballing that option  called  Partner Categories   We want to let advertisers know that we will be shutting down Partner Categories   Graham Mudd  a product marketing director at Facebook  said in a statement  This product enables third party data providers to offer their targeting directly on Facebook   he added   While this is common industry practice  we believe this step  winding down over the next six months  will help improve people s privacy on Facebook  In 2012  the Federal Trade Commission opened an inquiry into data brokers and subsequently recommended that Congress consider enacting a law  to make data broker practices more visible to consumers and to give consumers greater control over the immense amounts of personal information about them collected and shared by data brokers  How much of a difference these actions may make to Facebook s data privacy practices was unclear  Some privacy advocates noted  for instance  that the company s new centralized privacy and security settings page has been tried in the past  The platform made similar promises many times before   said Zeynep Tufekci  an associate professor at the University of North Carolina who studies how technology affects society  She pointed out that in 2010  Mr  Zuckerberg said in The Washington Post that Facebook users needed simpler controls over their privacy and had promised then that Facebook would  add privacy controls that are much simpler to use  Yet eight years later  the same concerns have resurfaced  Ms  Tufekci said  The past decade shows that user concerns over privacy appear to have little teeth on changing how the platform behaves  aside from a recycling of contrite statements and promises to do better from its C E O    she said

JERUSALEM    Israel announced Wednesday it was launching a domestic digital health database that could make it a global medical powerhouse  The move aims to improve public health worldwide but critics warn it risks compromising personal privacy Eli Groner  director general of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu s office  said the system could help prevent disease by pairing each individual with his or her own relevant data  With easy access to a person s medical history  he said it may be possible to become informed of a looming disease before one actually contracts it  The database will be unlike anything in the world   Groner said If successful   something he said depends on the number of those willing to participate   the database could be shared with medical researchers globally and help diagnose trends and help develop better medication worldwide Groner said the launch is expected by the end of 2018  stressing that divulging data depends on individual consent and that teams are now hammering out details on how to ensure maximum privacy The innovation is possible in part because of Israel s relatively small size and already centralized health care system  Most of the country s 8 7 million citizens are members of four main health care providers  which have been maintaining their records digitally for years  The new database aims to collect all the information in one place At his weekly Cabinet meeting  Netanyahu said Sunday the  275 million project is of  historic significance  and that its goal is to improve  preventive medicine  and also achieve  personal medicine  personally calibrated for each person  The announcement comes as Facebook s privacy practices have come under fire following revelations that it failed to prevent the data mining firm Cambridge Analytica from amassing personal information about millions of users and that the social network has been collecting Android users  phone call and text message histories without notice Critics say the selling of medical records for profit could spell disaster for patient confidentiality Tehilla Shwartz Altshuler  a senior fellow at the Israel Democracy Institute  said even data entered anonymously does not guarantee long term confidentiality and it is unclear what uses will be made in the future with data disclosed now  Medical records are the most private information you could think about  it includes DNA  bloodwork  all medical history   she said   Stuff you may not want insurance companies  employers  spouses  whoever to know   you don t even want Facebook to know so that it won t be able to mesh it up with other information it has about you  
NEW YORK    Fair housing advocates sued Facebook Tuesday  saying it lets landlords and real estate brokers target advertising to discriminate against women  those with disabilities and families with children The lawsuit in Manhattan federal court alleges investigations by fair housing supporters in New York  Washington  D C   Miami and San Antonio  Texas  prove Facebook continues to let advertisers discriminate even though civil rights and housing groups have notified the company since 2016 that it is violating the federal Fair Housing Act  It seeks unspecified damages and a court order to end discrimination Facebook said in a statement that the lawsuit is without merit and the company will defend itself vigorously  There is absolutely no place for discrimination on Facebook   the company said The lawsuit was filed by the National Fair Housing Alliance and other organizations  It comes as Facebook faces criticism over allegations British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica used details of 50 million Facebook users to help Republican candidate Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential campaign The housing groups say the Menlo Park  California based Facebook abused its power as it became what amounts to the biggest advertising agency in the world The lawsuit s explanation of how the discrimination is carried out begins with a description that would sound appealing to most advertisers  It said Facebook  with a customer base of over 2 billion people  collects a  treasure trove of information  to enable advertisers to target customers they believe are right for their businesses Then it lets advertisers scroll through hundreds of demographics  behaviors and interests to decide which characteristics they want to include or exclude  the lawsuit said The lawsuit said that the National Fair Housing Alliance did its own study after the investigative news nonprofit ProPublica published an article in October 2016 that said Facebook s online platform enabled advertisers to exclude from advertisements in the housing category those customers assigned black  Hispanic and other  ethnic affinities  It said the housing alliance was able to post a Facebook ad for a fictitious rental apartment after it selected options that excluded blacks and Hispanics from the ad s potential audience  After complaints  Facebook took steps to counter those kinds of discriminatory ads  the lawsuit said But it said additional work by ProPublica and the housing alliance revealed that as recently as weeks ago the company was approving advertising that  in effect  discriminated against mothers  families with young children and those with disabilities  Although Facebook stopped approving housing advertisements that used its  ethnic affinity  option in late 2017  it continues to create and develop content that facilitates advertisers excluding certain audiences based on legally protected characteristics   the lawsuit said It said Facebook from Dec  14 to Feb  23 had accepted 40 advertisements that the housing alliance and affiliates created that excluded potential home seekers based on family status or gender

Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg have clashed on artificial intelligence  space travel and the direction of technology On Friday  Mr  Musk showed just how little love lost there was between the two tech titans Mr  Musk  the chief executive of SpaceX and Tesla  deleted the Facebook pages of both of his companies  In doing so  he joined a growing chorus of tech leaders calling for people to abandon Mr  Zuckerberg s social network after it allowed a political consulting firm  Cambridge Analytica  to obtain and misuse data on 50 million users  The revelations have plunged Facebook into its worst public relations crisis in years As with most news in 2018  Mr  Musk s decision started with a barrage of tweets The tech luminary began by criticizing Sonos  a maker of wireless speakers  which had pulled some ads from Facebook for a week  Wow  a whole week  Risky       Mr  Musk tweeted in response to a news article about Sonos s move A minute later  he replied to Brian Acton  the founder of WhatsApp  which Facebook had acquired for  19 billion several years ago  Mr  Acton  who has since left Facebook  had on Wednesday called for people to   deletefacebook   What s Facebook   Mr  Musk replied to Mr  Acton  Then Mr  Musk announced he would shut down the SpaceX and Tesla pages  He said the Tesla Facebook page  looks lame anyway  The posts  which sent the Twittersphere into a virtual frenzy  escalated a public feud between Mr  Musk and Mr  Zuckerberg  Mr  Musk has often urged people to be cautious of embracing technology such as artificial intelligence because of the consequences it might bring  once saying that it could become so powerful it would start wars and turn people into its  house cats  Mr  Zuckerberg has argued that people need to trust and embrace technology in their lives  When the Facebook chief executive was asked about Mr  Musk s warnings around artificial intelligence during a Facebook Live broadcast in 2017  he called Mr  Musk a  naysayer   That s an insult in a technology world that celebrates perpetual optimism  With A I  especially  I m really optimistic   Mr  Zuckerberg said   People who are naysayers and kind of try to drum up these doomsday scenarios   I just  I don t understand it  I think it s really negative and in some ways I actually think it is pretty irresponsible  In response  Mr  Musk shot back that Mr  Zuckerberg did not fully comprehend the issues  I ve talked to Mark about this   Mr  Musk wrote   His understanding of the subject is limited  The two have also clashed on space travel  Mr  Zuckerberg traveled to Kenya in 2016 for the launch of a Facebook affiliated satellite called Amos 6  which was set to go to outer space in a SpaceX rocket  But the rocket exploded  Mr  Zuckerberg released a chilly statement  As I m here in Africa  I m deeply disappointed to hear that SpaceX s launch failure destroyed our satellite that would have provided connectivity to so many entrepreneurs and everyone else across the continent   he wrote on Facebook Mr  Musk is a frequent Twitter presence  who has posted increasingly macho and humor focused messages including video of himself playing with a flamethrower He said he plans to keep using his Instagram account  which is owned by Facebook  and on which he has 6 9 million followers When one reporter said on Twitter that it was remarkable Mr  Musk had so much time to troll online  Mr  Musk wrote   What  a troll  me   Facebook and SpaceX didn t immediately have a comment on Mr  Musk s deleted pages  A Tesla spokeswoman did not have a comment beyond Mr  Musk s tweets 
Good morning  Want to get California Today by email  Here s the sign up  Facebook has had a particularly bad few days  even for a Silicon Valley giant that has been under fire for months  The social network  which was once Silicon Valley s pride and joy  is now facing a new scandal over data privacy   and the fallout has been intense and keeps widening Let s recap how it all unfolded Over the weekend  The New York Times  along with The Observer of London and The Guardian  broke the news that a British political consulting firm  Cambridge Analytica  improperly obtained data on 50 million Facebook users and used it to target messages to potential American voters The revelations set off an immediate hue and cry  American and British lawmakers demanded that Facebook explain how the data had been harvested without people being alerted  Senator Amy Klobuchar  a Democrat from Minnesota  pressed Mark Zuckerberg  Facebook s chief executive  to appear before lawmakers in person  Others have since piled on On Monday  The Times reported that Facebook s executive in charge of information security  Alex Stamos  was planning to leave the social network by August  The move reflected heightened internal tensions at the top of the company  showing how the scrutiny has taken a toll Criticism of Facebook intensified on Tuesday  Wall Street investors sold off the company s shares  with a nearly 7 percent drop on Monday and a 2 5 percent fall on Tuesday  To top it off  the Federal Trade Commission opened an investigation into whether Facebook violated an agreement on data

Times The rain storms hitting California this week have been called many things  but two related terms keep popping up to describe this weather system   atmospheric river  and  Pineapple Express  So which one is it  Pineapple Express was a term for many years used to identify storms that came from Hawaii and hit the West Coast   said Marty Ralph  a research meteorologist affiliated with U C  San Diego s Scripps Institution of Oceanography   About 15 years ago we recognized that there s a broader definition called an atmospheric river  and those happen all over the planet  For non scientists  atmospheric rivers can be conceptualized visually  If you look from space from a satellite  it does look like a sinuous river   said Daniel Swain  a climate scientist at U C L A   It s a colorful term  and it s actually the official meteorological term to describe this process  But while all Pineapple Express storms are atmospheric rivers  not all atmospheric rivers are classified as Pineapple Express storms The source for the particular atmospheric river hitting California this week is near the Hawaiian Islands  hence the playful  Pineapple Express   Not everyone agrees  though  that this storm falls under that category  I wouldn t call this one a Pineapple Express  The storm is coming from the West  but the tail of this atmospheric river didn t come from Hawaii  it came from east of Hawaii   Mr  Ralph said   But I m not sure about arguing the jargon too much on this  The modern term is atmospheric river  Nomenclature aside  Mr  Swain urged residents in burn areas not to ignore the orders because of storm fatigue  Though the storm may not hit Los Angeles too hard  it could wallop those in Santa Barbara County  The forecast is severe  and if water falls too quickly it could lead to substantial flooding and mudslides  The forecast is for a really  really big rain   he said   Maybe half a foot or more of water is going to fall in a lot of places that have had intense fire activity  Whether all those inches of rain fall over three days or in a six hours is hard to predict  California Today goes live at 6 a m  Pacific time weekdays  Tell us what you want to see  CAtoday

NEW YORK SAN FRANCISCO    Fewer than half of Americans trust Facebook to obey U S  privacy laws  according to a Reuters Ipsos poll released on Sunday  illustrating the challenge facing the social media network after a scandal over its handling of personal information The poll  taken Wednesday through Friday  also found that fewer Americans trust Facebook than other tech companies that gather user data  such as Apple Inc  Alphabet Inc s Google  Amazon com Inc  Microsoft Corp and Yahoo Some 41 percent of Americans trust Facebook to obey laws that protect their personal information  compared with 66 percent who said they trust Amazon  62 percent who trust Google  60 percent for Microsoft and 47 percent for Yahoo The Reuters Ipsos poll was conducted online in English throughout the United States  It gathered responses from 2 237 people and has a credibility interval  a measure of accuracy  of 2 percentage points   Graphic  https   tmsnrt rs 2pA8DoG Facebook  the world s largest social media firm  has been offering apologies as it tries to repair its reputation among users  advertisers  lawmakers and investors for mistakes that let 50 million users  data get into the hands of political consultancy Cambridge Analytica   Graphic  Poll data   https   tmsnrt rs 2pFHBfN Facebook shares tumbled 14 percent last week  while the hashtag  DeleteFacebook gained traction online and the company s chief executive officer  Mark Zuckerberg  faced demands that he appear before U S  lawmakers to testify in a hearing Zuckerberg and Facebook s chief operating officer  Sheryl Sandberg  said last week that shoring up trust was their priority   We know this is an issue of trust  We know this is a critical moment for our company   Sandberg told CNBC on Thursday It is too early to say if distrust will cause people to step back from Facebook  eMarketer analyst Debra Williamson said  Customers of banks or other industries do not necessarily quit after losing faith  she said  It s psychologically harder to let go of a platform like Facebook that s become pretty well ingrained into people s lives   she said One reason that Facebook and other internet companies collect personal information from users is to deliver advertisements for products and services to people who are most likely to want them Facebook  with more than 2 billion monthly active users  made almost all its  40 6 billion in revenue last year from advertising The poll found that many people take a dim view of those  targeted  advertisements Some 63 percent said they would like to see  less targeted advertising  in the future  while 9 percent said they wanted more  When asked to compare them with traditional forms of advertising  41 percent said targeted ads are  worse  while 21 percent said they are  better   I think they make a lot of assumptions that are not true   poll respondent Maria Curran  56  who lives near Manchester  New Hampshire  said in a follow up interview  It s like if I show an interest in healthy eating  all of a sudden all of the ads are about weight control and exercise and how to lose weight  I just get inundated   she said Curran said she knows online retailer Amazon com also collects her information for targeted marketing  but that it is less annoying because it is a shopping site  not a place for personal conversations Another poll respondent  Kamaal Greene  26  said he likes targeted ads better than traditional ones because they provide a service  steering him to products he wants  A while ago I was looking for a special kind of glove for my job   said Greene  a firefighter from Detroit  I put it in my Amazon cart and forgot about it  Then  later  the ad popped up on     Facebook  and I was like  oh shoot   It reminded me and I clicked on it and bought it  A plurality of adults said they would like the government to take a bigger role in overseeing the industry s handling of user information  According to the poll  46 percent of adults said they want more government regulation  while 17 percent said they want less  Another 20 percent said they wanted no change  and the remaining 18 percent said they did not know  Reporting by Chris Kahn in New York and David Ingram in San Francisco  Editing by Leslie Adler 
WASHINGTON   House Intelligence Committee Republicans said Thursday that opposition to Donald J  Trump by the party s national security establishment had opened the door for two foreign policy advisers whose interactions with Russian intelligence prompted F B I  scrutiny The Republicans said they had found no evidence that either man  George Papadopoulos and Carter Page  had colluded with the Russians  despite the F B I  s interest in the men  Nor did campaign advisers and aides provide evidence that any member of the Trump campaign had colluded either  according to summaries of 44 findings and more than two dozen recommendations the committee voted to release Thursday  When asked directly  none of the interviewed witnesses provided evidence of collusion  coordination or conspiracy between the Trump campaign and the Russian government   one of the findings read First previewed last week  the findings are the culmination of a year old investigation by the committee  Democrats say the Republicans hurried the investigation  ignored crucial evidence and failed to follow obvious leads in an effort to clear Mr  Trump Other findings were less controversial and reflected the consensus position of American intelligence agencies and both parties on Capitol Hill  Representative K  Michael Conaway  Republican of Texas  who led the inquiry  said that the committee had found  a pattern of Russian active measures in the United States  both through cyberattacks and their use of social media to sow discord   This poses a serious threat to future U S  elections  including the primary elections that are already underway   he said in a statement   It s critical to release this information now to protect our country and our elections from foreign interference  In addition to releasing the summary findings  the committee voted to release a Republican written 250 page report over the objections of the committee s Democrats  who offered a series of unsuccessful last ditch motions to subpoena witnesses and documents  as well as to urge the House to hold Stephen K  Bannon  Mr  Trump s former adviser  in contempt  It was a fundamentally unserious effort   said Representative Adam B  Schiff of California  the top Democrat on the panel Democrats are drafting a dissenting report based on the committee s work thus far and have pledged to push on with their investigation without Republican cooperation  They have secured the cooperation of at least one new witness  Christopher Wylie  who helped found Cambridge Analytica and develop the company s voter profiling technology The Republican report chronicles Russia s increasingly brazen efforts in the run up to the 2016 election to compromise the United States  political institutions and fan existing divisions among voters  It concludes that the response by the Obama administration had been  insufficient  and said an October 2016 public statement calling out Russia proved  ineffective  The report takes issue with the  analytical tradecraft  used by intelligence agencies that concluded that President Vladimir V  Putin of Russia had wanted to harm the candidacy of Hillary Clinton and help Mr  Trump More divisive are the findings on collusion  That subject remains an area of inquiry by the Senate Intelligence Committee and the special counsel  Robert S  Mueller III  who took over the F B I  s investigation of the Trump campaign last year The House Republicans said that they had found repeated contacts between members of the Trump campaign team and Russians  but in each case  they concluded that there was no evidence of improper collaboration  Mr  Papadopoulos s attempts to connect the Trump campaign with the Russians had been  unsuccessful  Contacts with WikiLeaks were  ill advised   but did not show evidence that Trump associates were involved in the hacking or publication of Democratic emails  Republicans said  And though the Republicans said they were  concerned  about Mr  Page s  seemingly incomplete accounts  of a summer 2016 trip to Moscow  they noted that he had not been traveling on behalf of the campaign  Possible Russian efforts to set up a  back channel  with Trump associates after the election suggest the absence of collusion during the campaign  since the communication associated with collusion would have rendered such a  back channel  unnecessary   the Republicans wrote in another finding Many of the committee s recommendations center on the securing of the United States  voting systems and echo those presented by the Senate Intelligence Committee in recent days  including steps to improve communications of threats between states and the federal government and to ensure voting systems are not hacked Others could prove more controversial  For instance  the Republicans recommend that Congress consider repealing the Logan Act  a 1799 statute that bars private citizens from interfering with American diplomatic relations  The statute has never been successfully used in court but has been discussed in connection with contacts between Michael T  Flynn  Mr  Trump s first national security adviser  and the Russian ambassador at the time during the presidential transition They also recommend that the executive branch consider mandatory polygraph tests for political appointees with top secret security clearances who are not confirmed by the Senate 
 Good Friday  Here s what we re watching   Dropbox s valuation gives investors reason for caution   Dropbox rises 45 percent in its first day of trading   President Trump signs spending bill   GlaxoSmithKline withdrew its bid for Pfizer s consumer division   Bank of America Merrill Lynch paid  42 million to settle with N Y  s attorney general over trading practices   How bad will the U S  China trade fight be Get this in your inbox each morning  Sign up here Dropbox faces fierce competition  doesn t make a profit  its user growth has slowed  and outside shareholders have negligible voting power Yet for now  at least  investors think the company has an amazing future This optimism is reflected in the price of Dropbox s shares after they traded publicly for the first time on Friday  They leaped to  29 per share from  21  giving Dropbox  which charges businesses and individuals to store files on its computers  a market value of  12 7 billion  Putting that number in context reveals the bullishness of investors  Dropbox didn t have any profits in recent years  so comparisons have to be done using revenue and cash flows At  29  Dropbox is trading at 11 5 times last year s revenue of  1 1 billion  That is far higher than the 2 6 times sales for the companies in the Nasdaq index  according to Bloomberg data Of course  Dropbox s shares have benefited from demand for initial public offerings by technology companies  The stock might give back the gains  just as Snap s did after its I P O  last year Still  Dropbox s fans believe that the company has a strong financial future  despite competition from the likes of Google and Amazon  One of their main arguments is that the company can increase its revenue faster than its costs  a dynamic that should expand profit margins over time  Rishi N  Jaluria  an analyst at D A  Davidson  zeros in on its free cash flows  the amount of cash generated by a business after subtracting spending on plants and certain lease payments  to show this His measure of free cash flows was equivalent to 16 percent of revenue last year  but  in his estimation  that margin could rise to 19 percent this year  then 22 percent in 2019 After Friday s huge pop  Dropbox s stock has arguably  priced in  the impressive future cash flows that some analysts expect  Indeed  using Mr  Jaluria s forecasts  Dropbox s shares are already trading at a far higher cash flow valuation than that of Salesforce  a software and cloud computing company with a long track record What is more  Dropbox has areas of concern that should  in theory  give investors pause  The number of paid users grew 25 percent last year  slower than the 35 percent rate in 2016  Its average revenue per paying user edged up just 1 percent last year  Facebook s shares trade at the same multiple to sales as Dropbox s  Yet its revenue per user surged 26 percent last year   Peter EavisDropbox finished at  28 48  up 36 percent from its initial public offering price The file storage company on Thursday sold 36 million shares at  21 apiece  That was above its expected range of  18 to  20 a share and valued the company  9 2 billion At Friday s close  Dropbox is valued at  12 5 billionHere are some more numbers to put the I P O  market into perspective   So far this year  38 companies have listed shares on American exchanges  raising  12 8 billion  That s up 13 percent from a year ago and the most year to date since 2011  according to Thomson Reuters   The shares of companies that have debuted on American exchanges this year are up  on average  15    The average gain for tech I P O  this year is 43    Since the start of 2017  shares of tech companies that have gone public are up 72 percent The three best performing I P O s in 2018  Armo Biosciences   126 percent   CueBiopharma   120 percent   Menlo Therapeutics   102 percent The three worst performing I P O s in 2018  ADT   38 percent   Corporacion America Airports   39 percent   Solid Biosciences LLC   48 percent The closer investors look at President Trump s tariffs against China  the less they seem to like them This can be seen in the way the stock market has responded to the trade restrictions  which were announced on Thursday but were flagged a few days earlier  The S  P  500 index was down 5 95 percent this week  falling every day but one  And the selling at the end of the week looked like like it was turning into a rout  with the S  P  500 skidding 2 52 percent on Thursday and 2 1 percent on Friday We know that Mr  Trump watches the stock market s response to his policies  He was reassured when the stock market rose after he announced tariffs on imported steel and aluminum  Will this week s nosedive unsettle him to the point he softens his stance on trade with China  Mr  Trump sounded unfazed on Friday   I think the stock market is going to be great   he said   Peter EavisThe president abruptly backed down from his threat to veto the  1 3 trillion spending bill and signed it into law on Friday  avoiding a government shutdown Early in the day  the president had tweeted his displeasure with the bill  citing Congress s failure to fund his long promised border wall From this morning Julie Hirschfeld and Michael D  Shear of the NYT  The backstory to the bill  Here s how Congressional leaders settled lawmakers  objections  As Facebook plunged into a crisis over how Cambridge Analytica  a political consulting firm that provided voter targeting services to the Trump campaign  improperly obtained data on 50 million Facebook users  Mark Zuckerberg came under criticism for saying nothing  Finally  on Wednesday he released a statement and sat down for interviews  We asked Paul Pendergrass  a long time corporate communication professional and formerly DealBook s  Jack Flack  columnist  to offer his insights into the situation  In most of the interviews on Wednesday  Mark Zuckerberg was asked if he would be willing to testify before Congress  a task he has previously delegated to other senior Facebook executives  I d be happy to   he told CNN s Laurie Segall  before immediately qualifying that answer with   if it s the right thing to do  He then went on to offer Facebook s standard response to questions about why it has previously chosen other executives for Congressional hearings He elaborated Mr  Zuckerberg was surely being coy  When Congress requests the presence of a C E O  embroiled in a high profile controversy  they re usually not looking for information  They want a pelt to hang on the wall  and celebrity chief executives are particularly attractive So it s definitely a media opportunity  but for members of Congress  not the C E O If Mr  Zuckerberg wants proof of that  he can ask John Stumpf  the former C E O  of Wells Fargo  and the bank s current chief executive  Tim Sloan  how much information they were asked to provide  He could ask the same of the C E O  of United Airlines  Oscar Munoz  about his trip to Capitol Hill just after a passenger was dragged off one of his airplanes  For that matter  Mr  Zuckerberg could walk down the hallway and ask Facebook s general counsel  Colin Stretch  Just last fall Mr  Stretch endured a Senate lashing over the use of Facebook by Russian operatives When Mr  Zuckerberg is brought in to testify  the committee s  goal  will be to ensure the American public understands why social media platforms can t be trusted to regulate themselves  Mr  Zuckerberg s goal will be to try to avoid acting in a way that would elevate his role as the designated villain in the story Mr  Zuckerberg seems resigned to the fact that he will likely end up testifying   I would imagine at some time there will be a topic where I will be the sole authority on  and it will make sense for me to do it   he told Ms  Segall After this past week  he will have little leeway to refuse  Having been roundly accused of hiding in the crucial early days of the Cambridge Analytica scandal  he won t want to provide further evidence that he is inaccessible when people need to see him most Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg have clashed on artificial intelligence

As questions mounted last year about whether Facebook had been exploited to tilt the U S  presidential election  Mark Zuckerberg landed on a fishing trawler off Alabama s Gulf coast But the chatter surrounding the CEO s arrival in port was that it signaled something bigger than just the start of a 30 state personal tour  his designs on a job even more powerful than leading the social network that links 2 2 billion people worldwide  I asked him if he was interested in running for president of the United States   said Dominick Ficarino  who owns a shrimp business in Bayou La Batre  Alabama  and hosted Zuckerberg that afternoon   And his answer to me was   Can I answer you with a question  If you were me  would you   Thirteen months later  Zuckerberg no longer has the luxury of mulling a hypothetical next act  Instead  he is grappling with a crisis that has enveloped the company synonymous with his face and name  It does not help that the most glaring reminder of Facebook s flaws is the unabated uproar over the American presidency itself  The world feels anxious and divided  and Facebook has a lot of work to do   Zuckerberg wrote in January  laying out his annual  personal challenge  In 2017  the billionaire sought to travel to every state he d never visited  This year  Zuckerberg said his personal goal is to  fix  Facebook Yet things continue to get worse  Scrutiny of Facebook has intensified following reports that it failed to prevent the data mining firm Cambridge Analytica from amassing personal information about millions of users   possibly used to aid Donald Trump s campaign   and that the social network has been collecting Android users  phone call and text message histories without notice  That adds to criticism that Facebook manipulates its users and has allowed Russian bots to divide Americans by spreading false information On Monday  the Federal Trade Commission announced it was investigating Facebook for its privacy practices Zuckerberg preaches transparency  but flinches at questioning  He is undeniably brilliant  but stubborn about acknowledging the extent of Facebook s problems Is he prepared to do all it will take the right the ship  If he fails to do it  it may take a while but eventually people are going to rebel   said Roger McNamee  an early Facebook investor and adviser who has become a pointed critic  I thought Facebook was a force for good in the world for a really long time   McNamee said   I think it s really hard to make that case today  Days after Trump s election  Zuckerberg was pressed on the possibility that foreign agents had used his social network to divide voters  The idea that fake news on Facebook     influenced the election in any way  I think  is a pretty crazy idea   the CEO said at a technology conference  I think all of us were shocked to learn how wrong he was   said David Kirkpatrick  the author of a 2010 book about Facebook who questioned Zuckerberg that day Zuckerberg walked back the remark soon after  continuing a years long routine of self correction  But errors that reflect his stubbornness  those who know him say  are tempered by an eagerness to learn and a deep sense of reflection Naomi Gleit  Facebook s longest serving employee after the CEO  said Zuckerberg   who declined an interview request from The Associated Press   has talked about making the world a better place since he was 21  But his view of his place in that world seemed like  a burden of responsibility   she said With Zuckerberg   its experiment  learn  experiment  learn   said LinkedIn co founder Reid Hoffman  who has known him since 2004 But in the process of learning  Zuckerberg s inexperience has sometimes played out in public view  such as when he donated  100 million to Newark  New Jersey  schools in 2010 with few specifics outlining how the money should be spent  He was just a very young  naive  inexperienced guy who was brilliant     but just really didn t know much about how the world worked   said Dale Russakoff  author of  The Prize   a book chronicling the Newark experiment Zuckerberg and his wife  Priscilla Chan  have since chartered their own foundation to take on mammoth goals  like a  3 billion investment to cure  prevent or manage all diseases To free up his fortune for philanthropy  Zuckerberg last year pushed board members to restructure Facebook s stock  allowing him to sell off part of his stake while maintaining control  That prompted a suit by a group of shareholders who argued that the move would benefit only Zuckerberg while diluting the value of other investors  stakes  The company dropped the plan The gambit hints at the complexity of being Zuckerberg  who advocates for transparency and community but whose individual interests don t always align Zuckerberg  who has 105 million Facebook  friends   is compelled to share far more about himself than would be expected of another CEO  Yet he fiercely guards his privacy  Intellectually  he believes in transparency   Kirkpatrick said   But emotionally  it s very difficult for him  Shortly before the 2016 election  McNamee sent a letter to Zuckerberg and Facebook s chief operating officer  Sheryl Sandberg  warning the company was being manipulated in ways its creators never intended  It wasn t just about the U S  election  A consulting firm had collected data on people interested in the Black Lives Matter movement and sold it to police departments  and critics had detected a well organized  clandestine campaign supporting Brexit McNamee said he has been disappointed in the incremental changes announced since  but Zuckerberg s supporters say he is unfairly blamed Hoffman  the LinkedIn co founder  credits him with leading Facebook through a shift in mindset  nudging users into a more positive virtual environment   without completely shutting out inflammatory content Kirkpatrick argues  though  that Zuckerberg still must deal with existential threats to Facebook s business   its potential to negatively affect democracy and the way it hooks in users  I do not think he has yet grasped the gravity with which his service is being perceived to be a socially harmful force all around the world  And I also don t think he realizes the extent to which that really is true  McNamee  recalling Zuckerberg as a 22 year old visionary  said the CEO must be willing to rethink long held assumptions  But that does not mean he has to abandon building his global community  You ve achieved more than your wildest dreams   McNamee said he would tell Zuckerberg if asked again for his counsel   You re a billionaire  Now you have a chance to be a hero  
 Silicon Valley  returns to HBO Sunday after a particularly terrible week for Silicon Valley  as Facebook dealt with fallout from revelations about the Cambridge Analytica data breach and Uber notched a horrific milestone  The first pedestrian killed by a driverless car  The tech world of four or five years ago is definitely different than now   said Mike Judge  the creator of the show  The public conception of Silicon Valley as a place of whiz kids in hoodies  boldly claiming all the time that they were making the world a better place  has been replaced with something darker  he said For its fifth season  TV s  Silicon Valley  has undergone changes of its own  albeit of the less tragic variety  The largely luckless Pied Piper crew finally finds itself in charge  as well as a man down  T  J  Miller  the excitable comic who played the feckless blowhard Erlich Bachman  last seen in a Tibetan opium den in Season 4  left the show  bashing colleagues in interviews on the way out   In December  after Mr  Miller had quit the series  he was the subject of sexual assault allegations involving a former college classmate  he has denied the allegations  Mr  Judge was previously best known for creating the long running  King of the Hill  as well as diverse cult favorites that have had equally lengthy afterlives  like  Beavis and Butt Head    Office Space  and  Idiocracy   The new direction of  Silicon Valley   along with the changes and struggles in the tech world  has him reassessing his original plan to end the show after six seasons   It s taken on a second wind   he said  How many seasons did  Dallas  go   he added   I think it could go that long    For the record  14  In a phone conversation  Mr  Judge discussed the new season  Mr  Miller s departure  possible reboots of  King of the Hill  and  Idiocracy  and which of his creations are his favorites  These are edited excerpts from the conversation For the first time  the Pied Piper crew is running things  Did that change how you approached the story It felt pretty natural  In a way  some of this to me is analogous to stuff that happens in Hollywood  I started out making animated shorts in my house by myself  Then when  Beavis and Butt Head  happened  I had people fighting over it   there was the stress of  am I getting screwed here  And eventually I had about as many people working for me on  Beavis and Butt Head  as Richard  Thomas Middleditch  does in Season 5  and that became just as stressful  I m not someone who enjoys telling people to do something they don t want to do  and Richard is the same way  So there s plenty of comedy that can come from stuff like that How did T  J  Miller s departure affect the show Had he left after Season 1 or 2  it would have been really rough to try to make it work  But now it s actually kind of perfect timing because we were having trouble keeping him in the story  Not because of him  just because his character is not a programmer  He s just the guy who owned the house  We had done a bunch of comedy about that  about how he s kind of marginal and trying to make himself relevant  We have a lot of really great characters and actors  and I try to service them all  So it actually freed us up in the writing   Mr  Judge declined to comment on reports that Mr  Miller had been a disruptive presence on the set  What did you make of his bomb throwing exit   Laughs   It seemed very much like T  J    I m sure he wouldn t have it any other way  He s a brilliantly funny guy  I ve seen these quotes   he s always been a good put down artist  But yeah  I don t know what to really make of it  and it s not any of my business anymore  you know Jian Yang  Jimmy O  Yang  has been the new  expletive  of the house for a while  and he becomes a bigger one  like on a grander scale  And there are a lot of other characters picking up the slack  Laurie  Suzanne Cryer   there s more of her and Monica  Amanda Crew   There s definitely a lot more Jared  Zach Woods   And we ve got a really great robot coming up The show started off making fun of the goofy grandiosity of the tech industry  but the current perception of Silicon Valley is more critical  Has the show changed as a result Because we write it several months ahead of when it airs  we were already kind of noticing  just because we talk to a lot of people  in the industry  and a lot of them are just starting to realize the lack of conscience  And if they re not realizing that  people are pointing it out to them  I noticed when I worked in the tech world that there s just this belief that every gain they make is for the good of mankind  and never really questioning it  I m not saying they re all horrible people  but they look at the task at hand and don t really consider whether it s right or wrong Or whether people want their data to be sold to political operatives Yeah  and actually we deal with that this season  with what Richard s building  It s like that quote  If you re getting the service for free  then you re the product  Those servers and all the infrastructure and engineers cost money  So  you re paying by them looking for keywords in your email and popping ads up Which is familiar to anyone who s had a sneaker ad follow them around online Yeah a friend of mine told me through text message what hotel he was going to be staying at in Nashville  and the next thing I know  there s an ad for it on my Facebook page  It s all tied together Fox has said it wants to bring back  King of the Hill   Would you be involved in that Yeah  if they did  There have been a couple discussions about it  and about how we would do it  but nothing concrete yet  I think you d have to have Bobby and all of them be older  The Simpsons are such iconic characters  Bart could be that age forever because it s a more surreal show  But with  King of the Hill  being on 13 years  I think people were really starting to wonder why Bobby s still the same age Another old film of yours   Idiocracy   from 2006  has become a common reference point for  well  many things happening right now  Do people mention this to you On Twitter  like all day long  There was at one point talk about possibly a series  an animated series  a reboot like that  There were talks of musicals  I would like to have another stab at it one way or another  It was almost like a bigger concept than it was a movie   it was difficult to make and probably should have been a TV show  But yeah  I get it all the time  which is nice  But I don t really know what to make of it  or how much of it relates to the movie when people throw around the word  idiocracy  on Twitter Well when the C E O  of Carl s Jr  gets nominated for a cabinet position  That s what was really weird for me  specific things like that  There s Carl s Jr   The company had a notably unflattering presence in the film   There was the W W E  thing   The president in the movie was a former professional wrestler  in real life  President Trump appeared in a World Wrestling Entertainment match in 2007  Even when we were shooting the movie  the wardrobe designer showed me these shoes   they weren t out in the world yet  And she said   This is a start up  they re making these shoes and they re going to look completely ridiculous   Plastic shoes with holes in them  And I said to her   The only thing I m worried about is  what if these things blow up and by the time the movie comes out  they re everywhere   And she said   Oh  that s never going to happen  No one is going to buy these things   And then  the movie comes out  and they are all wearing Crocs  and those shoes were just becoming huge  So  I think that was a sign that maybe a lot of these dumb things are going to come to pass It was the Croc in the coal mine  Laughs   Oh man You have a remarkable track record of creating things that seem to stick with people  whether it s  Idiocracy  or  Office Space  or characters like Hank and Bobby Hill  Do you have a personal favorite That s a hard one to pick  I m probably a little partial to Beavis  Beavis and Butt Head  but mostly Beavis  I d say Lumbergh  from  Office Space   is another one  I d say those two probably come to mind the most because   well  I don t know Well for Lumbergh   I m old enough to remember when an office job sounded great  I worked at Jack in the Box and worked construction  those kinds of jobs  and I remember thinking   Oh my God  you can work in an office  That would be wonderful   And then the first time I did it  I had that type of boss   that passive aggressive boss  I would rather have a guy yelling at me on a construction site  I had done an animated version but the way Gary Cole played that character  I thought that was something really great that hadn t been done yet  So  I don t know  I m pretty proud of that one 
John R  Bolton is hardly known for sugarcoating his views  He once derided the United Nations by citing its 38 story headquarters in New York   If it lost 10 stories   he said   it wouldn t make a bit of difference  As it happened  Mr  Bolton went on to serve as the United States ambassador to the United Nations  perhaps the most undiplomatic of diplomats  But if President Trump wanted a national security adviser who would match his blunt  hard edge  confrontational approach to the world  then Mr  Bolton fits the bill With his trademark bushy gray mustache and his take no prisoners style  Mr  Bolton positioned himself to the right even of the foreign policy veterans who emerged from President George W  Bush s administration  a hawk among hawks  a hard liner who thrills conservatives and chills moderates and liberals  From his perch on Fox News  he has impressed Mr  Trump with a muscular vision of American power and a dark assessment of America s adversaries When he takes over as Mr  Trump s third national security adviser in 14 months  Mr  Bolton will almost surely encourage Mr  Trump s instincts against diplomatic agreements both consider weak and unwise  He shares the president s derisive opinion of the Iran nuclear deal and will presumably prod him to scrap it when a May deadline arrives  He likewise takes a dim view of international agreements like the Paris climate change accord  from which Mr  Trump announced last year that he would withdraw the United States  He has called the  two state solution  for Israel and the Palestinians dead But Mr  Bolton is not always in step with a president who sometimes veers back and forth between threatening  fire and fury  and eagerly seeking talks with foreign leaders  Mr  Bolton argues the virtues of pre emptive military action against North Korea and scorns diplomacy of the sort Mr  Trump has embarked on with Kim Jong un  He promotes more punitive sanctions against Russia rather than the kind of hand holding flattery of President Vladimir V  Putin that Mr  Trump practiced even this week  He supported the Iraq war  which Mr  Trump calls a catastrophic mistake In an interview on Thursday evening on Fox  Mr  Bolton said he recognized that his role would be to play the honest broker bringing different views to the president  and that it would be up to Mr  Trump to make the decisions But he made clear that he also planned to be Mr  Trump s enforcer  When the president makes a decision  he said  part of his job will be  making sure the bureaucracies get the decision and implement it  Mr  Bolton criticized the frequent leaks out of Mr  Trump s national security team  saying that a president cannot conduct diplomacy  if some munchkin in the White House  is leaking information to the news media   Leaking of that sort is simply unacceptable   he said Mr  Bolton s appointment elicited mixed reviews   Selecting John Bolton as national security adviser is good news for America s allies and bad news for America s enemies   said Senator Lindsey Graham  Republican of South Carolina   He has a firm understanding of the threats we face from North Korea  Iran and radical Islam  Critics  however  expressed concern that a bomb thrower in words could become a bomb thrower in deeds   Bolton played a key role in politicizing the intel that misled us into the Iraq War   Senator Edward J  Markey  Democrat of Massachusetts  wrote on Twitter   We cannot let this extreme war hawk blunder us into another terrible conflict  Clifford Kupchan  the chairman of the Eurasia Group  a consultant firm  sent a note to clients warning that Mr  Bolton s appointment  increases risk across the board   adding that it  makes U S  foreign policy  America First on Steroids   At one point  Mr  Bolton toyed with running for president himself  only to back off  Instead  he created an organization to support like minded candidates  His  super PAC  was one of the earliest customers of Cambridge Analytica  which has found itself confronting a deepening crisis after reports last weekend that the firm had harvested the data from more than 50 million Facebook profiles in its bid to develop techniques for predicting the behavior of individual American voters The firm was founded with a  15 million investment from Robert Mercer  the wealthy Republican donor who has backed both Mr  Bolton s PAC and Mr  Trump  Cambridge s so called psychographic modeling techniques  which were built in part with the data harvested from Facebook  underpinned its work for the Trump campaign in 2016  setting off a furious debate about the merits of the firm s methods  The same techniques were also the focus of its work for Mr  Bolton s PAC Using the psychographic models  the company designed advertisements from candidates supported by Mr  Bolton s PAC  including the 2014 campaign of Thom Tillis  the Republican senator from North Carolina  One advertisement  a video that was posted on YouTube  was aimed at fearful and neurotic voters   it emphasized security and the idea that Mr  Tillis could keep the United States safe Mr  Bolton also recorded a video used by a Russian gun rights group in 2013 to encourage Moscow to loosen gun laws  according to a report by NPR  The report said the video was part of an effort by Russian and American gun rights groups to collaborate in the years leading up to the 2016 election A native of Baltimore  Mr  Bolton  69  received undergraduate and law degrees from Yale University  In between stints in private practice  he took a series of increasingly important jobs in government  starting at the United States Agency for International Development under President Ronald Reagan and later as an assistant attorney general After the 2000 election  Mr  Bolton joined the Republican legal team in Florida during the recount battle between Mr  Bush and Vice President Al Gore  After the Supreme Court halted the recount  resulting in Mr  Bush s victory  Dick Cheney  the new vice president  persuaded the incoming secretary of state  Colin L  Powell  to make Mr  Bolton an under secretary in charge of arms control  In that role  he helped pull the United States out of the Antiballistic Missile treaty but negotiated a separate treaty with Russia paring nuclear arsenals When Condoleezza Rice succeeded Mr  Powell  she rebuffed pressure from Mr  Cheney to make Mr  Bolton her deputy  Instead  Mr  Bush nominated him for the United Nations post  but key Republicans opposed him  including a former assistant secretary of state who testified that Mr  Bolton was a  kiss up  kick down sort of guy  who abused underlings After the Senate refused to confirm Mr  Bolton  Mr  Bush gave him a recess appointment instead   a decision he would come to regret  Mr  Bolton clashed regularly with Ms  Rice and  after leaving office  broke with Mr  Bush over what he saw as weak kneed policies on North Korea and Iran He titled his memoir  Surrender Is Not an Option   and called the Foreign Service officers in the State Department s East Asian and Pacific Affairs Bureau the  EAPeasers   He even went after Mr  Bush   Nothing can erase the ineffable sadness of an American presidency  like this one  in total intellectual collapse   he wrote in The Wall Street Journal Mr  Bush bristled and  in a private meeting with a group of conservatives  said   Let me just say from the outset that I don t consider Bolton credible   Other former colleagues fought back more publicly  Christopher Hill  who negotiated with North Korea for Mr  Bush  dismissed Mr  Bolton as  Phyllis Schlafly with a mustache  After Mr  Trump s election in 2016  Ms  Rice and other Bush administration veterans like former Defense Secretary Robert M  Gates and Stephen J  Hadley  the former national security adviser  privately warned against an appointment for Mr  Bolton Mr  Trump considered Mr  Bolton for several posts but ultimately backed away each time  Unlike some of them  national security adviser does not require Senate confirmation  In the interim  Mr  Bolton has repeatedly praised Mr  Trump on television and in his Wall Street Journal columns even when the two disagreed He wrote on Twitter this month that sanctions on Mr  Putin and his inner circle needed to be tougher   If you want to punish a country for behavior you don t accept  you need punishing sanctions that are broad  not targeted  and they need to be enforced   he wrote In a Journal column  he made the case for a pre emptive military strike against North Korea   Given the gaps in U S  intelligence about North Korea  we should not wait until the very last minute   he wrote   That would risk striking after the North has deliverable nuclear weapons  a much more dangerous situation   Other options  he told a reporter  would be persuading China to topple North Korea s government or reuniting the peninsula under South Korean rule  although he acknowledged neither was likely A couple of weeks ago  he went on Fox to disdain South Korea s willingness to negotiate with North Korea   They re like putty in North Korea s hands   he said   As the great international relations theorist P  T  Barnum put it  there s a sucker born every minute   Two days later  Mr  Trump accepted an invitation to meet with North Korea s Mr  Kim As he prepared to take on his new assignment  however  Mr  Bolton was careful to minimize any differences with Mr  Trump  Asked Thursday evening on Fox about the president s decision to congratulate Mr  Putin on winning an election that most of the world considered a sham  Mr  Bolton said   I don t consider it a significant point one way or the other   adding   it s a matter of being polite  
As questions mounted last year about whether Facebook had been exploited to tilt the U S  presidential election  Mark Zuckerberg s to do list landed him on a fishing trawler off Alabama s Gulf coast But the chatter surrounding the CEO s arrival in port was that it signaled something bigger than just the start of a 30 state personal tour  his designs on a job even more powerful than leading the social network that links 2 2 billion people worldwide  It was one of the last things I asked him  thinking it would put a smile on his face   and it did   said Dominick Ficarino  who owns a shrimp business in Bayou La Batre  Alabama  and hosted a dockside lunch for Zuckerberg that Sunday afternoon  I asked him if he was interested in running for president of the United States  And his answer to me was   Can I answer you with a question  If you were me  would you   Thirteen months later  Zuckerberg no longer has the luxury of mulling a hypothetical next act  Instead  he is grappling with a crisis that has enveloped the company synonymous with his face and name  It does not help that the most glaring reminder of Facebook s flaws is the unabated uproar over the American presidency itself  The world feels anxious and divided  and Facebook has a lot of work to do   Zuckerberg wrote in January  laying out the  personal challenge  that he sets for himself each year In 2017  the billionaire challenged himself to travel to every state he d never visited  This year  long after critics began demanding an overhaul  Zuckerberg said his personal goal is to  fix  the platform that he has engineered to build community   but that is increasingly blamed for warping it Yet things continue to get worse  Scrutiny of Facebook has intensified following reports that it failed to prevent the data mining firm Cambridge Analytica from amassing personal information about millions of users   possibly used to aid Donald Trump s campaign   and that the social network has been collecting Android users  phone call and text message histories without notice  That adds to criticism that Facebook manipulates its users and has allowed Russian bots to divide Americans by spreading false information On Monday  the Federal Trade Commission announced it was investigating Facebook for its privacy practices Throughout the mounting crisis  Zuckerberg s response has been a study in contradictions  He crisscrossed the country  even as his company back home came under increasing fire  He preaches transparency  but flinches at questioning and craves privacy  He is undeniably brilliant  but stubborn in his reluctance to acknowledge the extent of Facebook s problems Even his critics say he is uniquely capable of righting the ship  But at 33  is he prepared to do all it will take  If he fails to do it  it may take a while but eventually people are going to rebel   said Roger McNamee  an early Facebook investor and adviser who has become one of the company s most pointed critics  I thought Facebook was a force for good in the world for a really long time   McNamee said   I think it s really hard to make that case today     Days after Trump s election  Zuckerberg was pressed on the possibility that foreign agents had used his social network to divide voters  The idea that fake news on Facebook     influenced the election in any way  I think  is a pretty crazy idea   the CEO told the audience at a California technology conference  I think all of us were shocked to learn how wrong he was   said David Kirkpatrick  the author of a 2010 book about Facebook who questioned Zuckerberg that day   You can certainly say that he was culpable  in that he was naive and inattentive to what was happening in his system  But I don t think he was lying  Zuckerberg walked back the remark soon after  continuing a years long routine of self correction  But errors that reflect his stubbornness  those who know him say  are tempered by an eagerness to learn from mistakes and a deep sense of reflection Donald Graham  the former chairman of the Washington Post Co   recalled that when he met Zuckerberg in 2005  outsiders still weren t sure what to make of Facebook  I would ask him a question and he would pause long enough   15 seconds  20 seconds   that I would think  Did I insult him  Did he not hear me    said Graham  who went on to serve on the company s board from 2008 to 2015  Since I am from Washington  I m not used to people thinking before they are answering a question      But Mark  then as now  was thinking about the right answer  Zuckerberg s boyish appearance  even today  is a reminder of just how young he was when he created what would become the world s biggest social network  back in his dorm room at Harvard  I didn t know anything about building a company or global internet service   he wrote in January   Over the years I ve made almost every mistake you can imagine  Naomi Gleit  Facebook s longest serving employee after the CEO  said Zuckerberg   who declined an interview request from The Associated Press   has been talking about making the world a better place since he was 21  But his view of that world and his place in it  seemed almost like a gravity  a burden of responsibility   she said That seriousness coincides with a sense of certainty Gleit recalled Zuckerberg s steadfast attachment to a Facebook message service similar to email  even as more people began using phones to send text messages  But co workers eventually swayed the CEO  whom she described as a  learn it all   That change of mind informed Facebook s 2014 purchase of the WhatsApp messaging service for  19 billion  I think he would even say now that he was initially wrong   Gleit said With Zuckerberg   it s experiment  learn  experiment  learn   said LinkedIn co founder Reid Hoffman  who has known him since 2004  Hoffman said that is evident in Zuckerberg s enthusiasm for software  which can be overwritten to fix problems  That facility  he said  makes Zuckerberg the equal of executives with far more experience But in the process of learning  Zuckerberg s inexperience has sometimes played out in public view    In 2010  Zuckerberg announced on Oprah Winfrey s television show that he would donate  100 million to schools in Newark  New Jersey Critics labeled it an attempt to polish his image  just as the biopic  The Social Network  was being released  Still  there was little questioning his generosity  The problem was that Zuckerberg   who knew little about education   made the gift with few specifics outlining how it should be spent  He was just a very young  naive  inexperienced guy who was brilliant at technology and computers and the internet  but just really didn t know much about how the world worked   said Dale Russakoff  author of  The Prize   a book chronicling how the money went to high priced consultants  with minimal effort by leaders to build community support By the end of the process  Zuckerberg had developed a clearer understanding of how to get things done  He and his wife  Dr  Priscilla Chan  have since chartered their own foundation and structured it to take on mammoth goals  like a  3 billion investment to cure  prevent or manage all diseases  He has pledged to donate 99 percent of his Facebook stock to philanthropy  Zuck s maturation has occurred in front of the public   said Kirkpatrick  author of  The Facebook Effect  The Inside Story of the Company that Is Connecting the World     But he also still lives with the consequences of the decisions he made when he was less mature  At Facebook  Zuckerberg has grown increasingly bold in using huge sums of money to pursue corporate goals  which includes purchasing competitors   or companies that could grow into competitors Facebook s  1 billion purchase of Instagram in 2012   then unprofitable and little known   came as a shock to Wall Street  Two years later came the multibillion dollar deal to buy WhatsApp  a company that remains unprofitable but has given Facebook a prime portal into developing countries and other regions outside the U S In 2014  soon after Facebook bought a virtual reality firm called Oculus  Zuckerberg found himself being grilled in a lawsuit brought by a competitor who accused an Oculus executive of stealing trade secrets  Under questioning  he talked about the pressure he exerted to make the Oculus deal happen  and his vision of growing it so fast  that we can get every developer and studio in the world building just for Oculus before any big competitor exists  Last year  in a bid to free up his fortune for philanthropy  Zuckerberg pushed board members to restructure Facebook s stock  allowing him to sell off part of his stake while maintaining control  That prompted a suit by a group of shareholders who argued that the move would benefit only Zuckerberg while diluting the value of other investors  stakes  Days before Zuckerberg was scheduled to testify as part of the suit  the company dropped the plan The gambit hints at the complexity of being Zuckerberg  who advocates for transparency and the interests of the community but whose individual interests don t always align The paradox is self inflicted  the trade off for creating a venture premised on users  willingness to share details of their lives  That requires Zuckerberg  who has 105 million Facebook  friends   to reveal far more about himself than would be expected of any other CEO  whether it s photos of him and Chan baking sweets for the Jewish holiday of Purim or dressing their daughters for the Chinese New Year Yet he fiercely guards his privacy When calls went out last year for Zuckerberg to testify before a Senate committee  the company sent its lawyer  And when he and Chan bought 700 acres on the Hawaiian island of Kauai last year  they quietly filed lawsuits against hundreds of Hawaiians   withdrawn after protests   that would have cut off locals  access to the land by negating their interest in small ancestral tracts within the estate s boundaries  Intellectually  he believes in transparency   Kirkpatrick said   But emotionally  it s very difficult for him      Facebook works hard to present Zuckerberg as someone deeply interested in the ordinary people whose lives are at the heart of its business Stops on last year s U S  tour  never announced  were set up by facilitators who revealed details to only a select few  But many of the visits were covered by the media and documented in professional quality photos on Zuckerberg s Facebook page soon after he d departed Ostensibly  the idea was for Zuckerberg to learn  But in their brief interactions  many people were just as interested in finding a way to connect with him In Hazard  Kentucky  educator Paul Green became custodian of the small town s biggest secret  A staffer from Zuckerberg s foundation  peppering Green with questions about the region s educational cooperative  finally admitted it was because the CEO himself wanted to visit  Green s reward for keeping it quiet was seeing the wide eyed grins when Zuckerberg pulled up and greeted local high schoolers studying robotics and programming Walking through science demonstrations  Zuckerberg spent more time trading tech tales with the teenagers than quizzing the teachers  He just lit up with those kids   Green said   The way he talked with them about some of the things he did when he was in school and his passion for technology  it really was cool  When Zuckerberg toured an oil rig near Williston  North Dakota  last July   from the minute he got out of the car to the minute he got back in the car  he was nothing but questions   said Ron Ness  president of the North Dakota Petroleum Council  which arranged the visit  I had Bakken shale  limestone  dolomite  and he was able to hold them in his hand  along with a bottle of crude oil  And I remember him asking   How do you get that oil out of that rock    geologist Kathleen Neset said In Dayton  Ohio  Zuckerberg met with officials  caregivers and families battling drug addiction  Lori Erion  the founder of the group Families of Addicts  said she told him what it was like to learn her daughter  April  had shot up heroin in their own home  It seemed to get him really emotional   Erion said  recalling how Zuckerberg stood up suddenly and told the group he needed a few minutes to steady himself  When he returned  he asked what makes an addict stay clean and how families got their loved ones into treatment  We didn t ever talk about Facebook at all   Erion said   which is really interesting because Facebook is really the main way of us getting information out  He really was just like a regular person     As Zuckerberg connected with Americans face to face  controversy over Facebook continued to spiral Shortly before the election  McNamee sent a letter to Zuckerberg and Facebook s chief operating officer  Sheryl Sandberg  warning that Facebook was being manipulated in ways its creators never intended  It wasn t just about the U S  election  A consulting firm had collected data on people interested in the Black Lives Matter movement and sold it to police departments  and critics had detected a well organized  clandestine campaign supporting Brexit All this pointed to a deep problem with Facebook   that it was simply not equipped or not willing to prevent the misuse of its platform McNamee said he has been disappointed in the incremental changes announced since Facebook has adopted this  libertarian philosophy that says  we are not responsible for anything downstream  we are allowed to disrupt media  we are allowed to addict our users and we are not responsible for any of the consequences of any of that    he said Zuckerberg could change that  But McNamee said it is not enough to hire thousands of workers to weed through fake and abusive posts if those posts keep getting through  And tweaking Facebook s newsfeed so users see more posts from families and friends does not address his certainty that the algorithms underlying Facebook make it dangerously addictive  You cannot cure addiction by doing more of the thing that got you addicted in the first place  which is what Zuck recommends   McNamee wrote in an email Critics say Facebook continues to ignore the possibility of the social network being used for dark purposes  but Zuckerberg s supporters counter that he is unfairly blamed for problems he could not have foreseen Hoffman  the LinkedIn co founder  credits Zuckerberg with leading Facebook through a shift in mindset  making changes that will nudge users into a more positive virtual environment   without completely shutting out inflammatory content  Facebook basically is saying we enable people based on the way they behave  That s a very democratic argument  If people want to live in filter bubbles  who are we to say  Don t live in filter bubbles   even though we don t want them to   Hoffman said But Kirkpatrick argued that Zuckerberg s and Sandberg s surety that Facebook has a positive impact on society has blinded them to parallel realities  The company can t be fixed  Kirkpatrick said  until Zuckerberg comes to terms with existential threats to the way the social network does business   its potential to negatively affect democracy and the way it hooks in users  There s no question in my mind that Mark Zuckerberg is an ethical and responsible human being who wants to do the right thing   he said   However  I do not think he has yet grasped the gravity with which his service is being perceived to be a socially harmful force all around the world  And I also don t think he realizes the extent to which that really is true  McNamee  recalling Zuckerberg as a 22 year old visionary  said the CEO must be willing to rethink long held assumptions  But that does not mean he has to abandon building his global community  You ve won   McNamee said he would tell Zuckerberg if asked again for his counsel  You ve achieved more than your wildest dreams  You re a billionaire  Now you have a chance to be a hero  
MENLO PARK  Calif    John Tenanes  Facebook s vice president for real estate  is showing off the company s plans for expansion  It will have offices for thousands of programmers to extend Facebook s fearsome reach  But that is not what Mr  Tenanes is excited about He leans over a scale model of the 59 acre site  which is named Willow Village   There will be housing there   he points   There will be a retail street along here  with a grocery store and a drugstore  That round building in the corner  Maybe a cultural center  In just a few years  Facebook built a virtual community that linked more than two billion people  an achievement with few precedents  Now the social network is building a real community  the kind you can walk around  It is a project with many precedents in American history  quite a few of them cautionary tales about what happens when a powerful corporation takes control of civic life Facebook  Mr  Tenanes says  has a dual mission   We want to balance our growth with the community s needs  Willow Village will be wedged between the Menlo Park neighborhood of Belle Haven and the city of East Palo Alto  both heavily Hispanic communities that are among Silicon Valley s poorest  Facebook is planning 1 500 apartments  and has agreed with Menlo Park to offer 225 of them at below market rates  The most likely tenants of the full price units are Facebook employees  who already receive a five figure bonus if they live near the office The community will have eight acres of parks  plazas and bike pedestrian paths open to the public  Facebook wants to revitalize the railway running alongside the property and will finish next year a pedestrian bridge over the expressway  The bridge will provide access to the trail that rings San Francisco Bay  a boon for birders and bikers Mr  Tenanes contemplates the audacity of building a city  It s a good thing  right   he says Depends how it goes  Facebook is testing the proposition  Do people love tech companies so much they will live inside of them  When the project was announced last summer  critics dubbed it Facebookville or  in tribute to company co founder Mark Zuckerberg  Zucktown The company has not warmed to these names   I owe my soul to the company store   Tennessee Ernie Ford sang  But Facebook s ambitions are now confronting a more urgent problem  an escalating crisis over the company s power to sway elections  its casual approach to data privacy and its susceptibility to Russian manipulation  If Facebook s image is permanently sullied by the furor over Cambridge Analytica  the data firm hired by President Trump s 2016 election campaign  Zucktown will falter before it is finished The social media colossus is not the only Big Tech company in the complicated position of dressing up its expansion as a gift to its neighbors A few miles down the 101 highway  another new civic corporate partnership is underway in the city of Mountain View  Google is promising to place the public  in the very heart of Google s vibrant community  The search company plans a 600 000 square foot office building with a roof that melts up into soft peaks  kind of like a meringue  It will have stores  cafes  gardens and even a space for theatrical performances  as well as a place for consumers to test drive new Google technology Google will build 5 000 homes on its property under an agreement brokered with Mountain View in December  Call it Alphabet City as a nod to Alphabet  Google s corporate parent  The company said it was still figuring out its future as a landlord  and declined further comment Zucktown and Alphabet City  as well as similar projects being contemplated across Silicon Valley  could at a minimum have consequences for the start up culture that transformed fruit orchards into the world s greatest tech hub  Silicon Valley was built by engineers jumping from company to company  That drove the innovation that sped the rise of some firms and hastened the demise of others As workers begin to literally live at the office  they will inevitably be more beholden to bosses who also collect the rent  After all  it is much harder to find a place to live in Silicon Valley than a new job  Turnover may slump  and so might the turnover in ideas The push into the physical also has implications for the 1 2 million people in Silicon Valley who are teachers  fitness instructors  clerks  baristas   all those who hold jobs that do not come with stock options  As they inch down the clogged streets and bid money they don t have on miserable houses  they will hear the siren call of Big Tech  We can fix broken communities by building new ones  Trust us  Corporations are paying for things that the city or county and state used to pay for   said Cecilia Taylor of Belle Haven Action  a community advocacy group   They have a lot of money  A lot of money  More than the city does  And a lot more power  On a wall in the Facebook division charged with the company s growth there is a poster with a classic tech admonition   Go Big or Go Home   Facebook is in essence tweaking that to  Go Big at Home   About 12 000 of its 25 000 employees work in Menlo Park  In a decade  it will have space for 35 000   slightly more than the city s current population The notion of communities run by and for companies has been a fixture in the United States almost from the beginning  Often these places were exercises in plunder In the textile town of Lowell  Mass   in 1846  the mill clock slowed down to lengthen shifts and then sped up at night when the workers were off  according to one contemporary reformer  U S  Steel built Gary  Ind   but took little responsibility for its employees  many of whom lived in substandard housing in crime ridden neighborhoods There were more benign examples too  Milton Hershey began building a chocolate factory in the middle of Pennsylvania in 1903 and then surrounded it with a community where  he pledged  there would be  no poverty  no nuisances  no evil   In return for surrendering certain rights   like local elections and privacy   workers in the town of Hershey got medical coverage  a free junior college  parks and a zoo Corporate good will  however  had a way of curdling over time In Wisconsin  the Kohler family established a plumbing fixtures factory in 1900 and then created a town around it  Kohler built houses for couples and dorms for single men  financed schools  had a pension plan and paid well  When economic conditions deteriorated during the Depression  however  the employees tried to strike  Kohler responded by arming its deputies with machine guns  In the ensuing clash  more than 40 strikers were shot and two were killed By the 1960s  the era of the company town in America was fading  even as countries like China picked up the notion  Zhengzhou is a remote Chinese city that was once impoverished  It now has 350 000 workers building iPhones Hardy Green  author of  The Company Town  The Industrial Edens and Satanic Mills That Shaped the American Economy   said that the tech companies had been reviving elements of the company town in the United States for years now The free meals  nap pods  concierge services  yoga classes  on site laundry and haircuts are a perk but also a modern way of slowing down the mill clock so the workers can spend more time working  But in a society where government is increasingly ineffective  company towns are nevertheless likely to be welcomed  or at least tolerated  It may be the best option for many  just as a benevolent dictatorship can be O K  for as long as the benevolence lasts   Mr  Green said Only seven years ago  Silicon Valley had a very different attitude about building housing for workers  much less the community  A gaunt Steve Jobs  in what would turn out to be his last public appearance  made his case before the Cupertino City Council for a new Apple headquarters Mr  Jobs told council members how great the new doughnut shaped headquarters was going to be  It would have a lot of trees  a theater  curved windows  Architecture students would come from all over to study it City Council member Kris Wang had a question  How could the 60 000 Cupertino residents benefit from this new campus  We d like to continue to stay here and pay taxes   Mr  Jobs said   If we can t  we d have to go somewhere like Mountain View  Ms  Wang  a former Cupertino mayor  persisted   Do we get free Wi Fi or something like that   I m a simpleton   Mr  Jobs replied   I always had this view that we pay taxes and the city should do those things  That s why we pay taxes  If we can get out of paying taxes I d be glad to put up a Wi Fi network  Since that June 2011 meeting  the number of hours commuters in Silicon Valley lose every day to congestion has doubled to 66 000  About 300 000 new jobs have been created  pushing the median apartment rental rate up 37 percent and the median cost of a home to  968 000 Meanwhile  the big companies   not only Apple but Amazon  which has an increasingly large presence in Silicon Valley  as well as Facebook and Google   are much wealthier Apple built a  5 billion campus that  for all its splendor  is not readily accessible by mass transit  That problem was compounded by the company s apparent lack of interest in where its new employees would live  Decisions like these are no longer acceptable from a public relations point of view  and would not be smart for the companies in any case  If Silicon Valley continues choking on its traffic  the companies will find hiring not merely difficult but impossible  Even for a tech programmer  a  2 million house is a hurdle So the virtual companies are being forced to grapple with the most intractable physical issues  I don t think Google  for instance  thought they were going to have to get into the transportation business   said Allison Arieff  editorial director of San Francisco Bay Area Planning and Urban Research Association  a research organization   But they now have a giant swath of the company devoted to getting people around  Housing seems the next step  No one bats an eye if universities build housing for students  grad students and tenured professors  When the tech companies played a much smaller role in Silicon Valley 25 years ago  even the working class could afford to live here  So could Stanford University students  Traffic flowed naturally However enticing this past might seem  efforts to put the brakes on growth have had limited success Measure M  a 2014 effort to restrict development in Menlo Park s downtown  was soundly defeated by voters  Patti Fry  a former chairwoman of the Menlo Park City Planning Commission and an architect of the measure  said she is wary of Facebook s increasing size and power  They re doing more than most companies  but most of what they do serves them   she said   I do not expect a company to have as a priority providing community services that a real community needs  They re in business to be in business  Drew Combs is a former journalist who became a member of the Menlo Park Planning Commission and then ran for City Council in 2014  He was loosely associated with Measure M and when it failed  so did his bid  He is now chairman of the planning commission  which reviews the use permits required for large projects  I don t think in a lot of cases this is a good versus evil battle   Mr  Combs said   This is a negotiation between different stakeholders  Mr  Combs has since gotten a new job  He now works at Facebook  He recuses himself when Facebook issues come up before the commission  and also recuses himself from the question of whether Facebook is turning into a one company town  Local issues here are passionately and thoroughly debated   he said   This hasn t waned during the six years I ve been involved and I don t expect that it will in the future  Facebook s move toward openness and community engagement is recent  Its current campus  which it moved into in 2011  is a ring of buildings with a  street  in the middle that has restaurants  pop up shops  a book exchange and other amenities  but only employees can go there Across the street  the company opened in 2015 an office designed by Frank Gehry  It is basically one enormous room   the largest open floor plan in the world  Facebook says  On the landscaped roof is a garden  a walking loop and many trees  The neighbors cannot see any of this In Zucktown  this notion of firmly separated insiders and outsiders will be deliberately blurred  The retail stores will not be managed by Facebook  But we have the mechanism  we are the property owner   says Mr  Tenanes  the real estate chief  adding that he doesn t know exactly how it will work in practice   It is a bit new  Menlo Science   Technology Park  a decaying office park that will be torn down for Willow Village  is not exactly a beloved part of the city  and neither are the other sites on which Facebook has been building  They were in an industrial zone  That has helped insulate the company from criticism  which nonetheless simmers beneath the surface in Belle Haven The Peery Foundation  a grantmaker based nearby in Palo Alto  made a short video two years ago documenting how the area around Facebook s headquarters was changing  It interviewed dozens of local residents  including one woman who referred to landlords who had been renting to low income families and were now selling their properties   Eventually   she said   there s going to be nobody here but Facebook  Facebook  in a comment at the end of the film  acknowledges   We still have a lot of work to do   The company has increased its efforts in the community  So has the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative  a limited liability company set up by Mr  Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan for philanthropy  At the same time  Facebook has continued to expand Ms  Taylor grew up in Belle Haven  left  came back to run for the Menlo Park City Council in 2016  narrowly lost  and last year formed Belle Haven Action  It is an organization on a shoestring  she and two colleagues do not have offices and hold meetings at the local community center  Facebook is very smart   she said   They have money in every problem  Immigration  Housing  Transportation  Education   For example  the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative gave  3 million to an East Palo Alto legal services group that helps low income residents with housing and immigration issues  It has given more than  7 million to create a primary school And it is helping fund Belle Haven Action  In January  the organization got a  75 000 grant from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative Ms  Taylor acknowledged it is awkward for an advocacy group to be funded by the company it is confronting  but said   When you don t have resources  that makes your work so much harder  This is about being a disrupter but also a negotiator  A recent accomplishment by Belle Haven Action  getting a  no right turn  sign on a busy Facebook parking lot to stop workers from heading deeper into the community in an attempt to avoid congestion  Next it would like the company to install cameras on the streets to monitor traffic and pedestrian safety  We need movement because nothing has been done for so long   said Ms  Taylor   Now Facebook comes in and they re willing to give us a few pennies and something for the community  The trains will run  We ll have better schools  a grocery store   although we re going to push for a co op  Mr  Jobs promised Cupertino nothing   and that s about all Cupertino got  Apple gave  6 million to an affordable housing fund and pays certain fees to the city  but the gleaming new campus is resolutely closed to the public Its critics  Apple says  don t understand  We didn t make Apple Park for other people   Apple chief design officer Jonathan Ive said at a recent talk in Washington   It wasn t made for you  Ms  Wang  the former Cupertino council member  has no regrets about not pushing Mr  Jobs harder   I m proud of Apple   she says   They ve done a good job  The campus is very impressive  Her only wish   and it s a small one   is that someday Apple will invite her in to actually see it If Apple is unapproachable  Facebook and its money are becoming inescapable  In addition to the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative s grants to local organizations  the social network is getting more involved with local policing In 2014  Facebook paid  200 000 to create a new Menlo Park police substation adjoining its campus  It pays the annual rent  It also financed the  173 146 annual salary and benefits of an officer  Last year the company proposed giving the city  11 million to pay for a six officer unit  That plan evoked some disquiet  Instead of being beholden to the public  public servants will be beholden to a private company   a local activist  J T  Faraji  said at a City Council meeting  Our goal is to strengthen the community   said Juan Salazar  a Facebook public policy manager   We want a more permeable relationship  where we engage more  The parks  the grocery store  are places to congregate together  to build a sense of place  David Kirkpatrick  whose book  The Facebook Effect  is a history of the company s early years  is ambivalent about the expansion  While he says  Facebook is a company that at least tries to have a conscience   he also worries about so much enforced togetherness on employees  Facebook has the attitude that if you are really a good employee you will live  eat and sleep Facebook   he said   That creates insularity  which is a big problem in Silicon Valley already  If Silicon Valley is the laboratory for the increasingly intimate relationship between big tech  its workers and its neighbors  who are also frequently its users   seeds are being planted elsewhere as well In Toronto  an offshoot of Google won approval last fall to redevelop a 12 acre chunk of the waterfront  Chicago was so eager to land Amazon s new headquarters that it proposed returning to the company half of all the state income tax its employees paid   money that would enrich the company  one of the world s most highly valued  at the expense of the community  Chicago is now a finalist  So is Newark  where the state is offering up to  7 billion in tax credits As Facebook works to make Willow Village a reality  its ambitions can only grow The 1 500 apartments  are a starting point   said Mr  Tenanes   I would hope we could do more  We re solving a problem here  
BOGOTA    A cellphone application blocked by the Colombian commerce regulator said on Thursday it has not shared Colombian users  data with Cambridge Analytica  the political consultancy that has been accused of violating Facebook users  privacy to influence elections in Britain and the United States Colombia  which will hold presidential elections in May  on Wednesday blocked access to the Pig gi app  which gives users free top ups in exchange for receiving ads and completing surveys  The app has more than a million downloads in Colombia and Mexico combined The regulator said the app might be connected to Cambridge Analytica  accused by a whistleblower of improperly accessing data to target U S  and British voters in recent elections A representative for the app told Reuters in an email on Thursday that Pig gi did not have a relationship with the consultancy in the Andean country and that it has not shared any data gained from surveys of Colombian users with Cambridge Analytica Pig gi also said it had not yet been informed of the ban by the Colombian regulator  Pig gi users have the choice to share their opinions consensually in exchange for internet connectivity coins  Their opinions are always anonymized before they are sent in accordance with Colombian and Mexican law   the app said in a statement posted on its Facebook page The app cut ties with Cambridge Analytica in Mexico after the data scandal broke  saying it had shared results of two election polls of Mexican users with the consultancy and other partners The commerce regulator said it would comment when its investigation had concluded Facebook said on Wednesday it would end its partnerships with several large data brokers who help advertisers target people on the social network  The company says the information of about 50 million Facebook users wrongly ended up in the hands of Cambridge Analytica Cambridge Analytica has denied Facebook data was used to help to build profiles on American voters and build support for Donald Trump in the 2016 U S  presidential election  Reporting by Julia Symmes Cobb  editing by G Crosse 
LONDON    A committee of British lawmakers published written evidence on Thursday provided by a whistleblower who says information about 50 million Facebook users ended up in the hands of political consultancy Cambridge Analytica Cambridge Analytica said the documents did not support whistleblower Christopher Wylie s testimony to the committee this week Wylie  who formerly worked for Cambridge Analytica  CA   alleges the data was used to help to build profiles on American voters and raise support for Donald Trump in the 2016 U S  presidential election He also alleges that CA was linked to Canadian firm AggregateIQ  AIQ   which he says was involved in the development of the software used to target voters  AggregateIQ  he says  received payment from a pro Brexit campaign group before the 2016 referendum when Britain voted to quit the European Union This was co ordinated with the lead  Vote Leave  group in a breach of British electoral funding rules  Wylie alleged  Vote Leave denies any wrongdoing Wylie appeared before the Digital  Culture  Media and Sport Committee of the British parliament on Tuesday  The committee said Wylie provided it with documents including a services agreement between AIQ and SCL Elections  an affiliate of Cambridge Analytica  dated September 2014 Reuters was unable to independently verify the authenticity of the documents made public by the committee  None of these documents support the false allegations made in Tuesday s hearing   Cambridge Analytica said in a statement  adding that Wylie had left the company in July 2014 and would have no direct knowledge of its work or practices since then  It is wrong to suggest that Cambridge Analytica s earlier relationship with Aggregate IQ implies that we were involved with their work for Vote Leave  Cambridge Analytica did no work in any capacity in the 2016 EU referendum  AIQ did not respond to a Reuters request for comment after Tuesday s committee hearing  but in an earlier statement said it had never entered into a contract with Cambridge Analytica and had never been part of the firm The parliamentary committee s chairman has said it was  astonishing  that Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg decided not to answer lawmakers  questions  given the claims that Wylie had made about how data was used  Reporting by Alistair Smout  editing by Andrew Roche and David Stamp 
Over the last half decade  few stocks have been more beloved by investors and Wall Street analysts than Facebook  No wonder  After a rocky initial public offering in 2012  it has rolled over one obstacle after another  including the shift to mobile computing and the rise of photo sharing  It delivered revenue and user growth that surpassed even the most optimistic projections By the end of last year  Facebook had 2 2 billion active users  Its stock rose 53 percent last year  single handedly accounting for 3 7 percent of the 21 8 percent gain in the Standard   Poor s 500 stock index  according to S  P  Dow Jones Indices  By early February  its market capitalization had surpassed  560 billion  making it the fifth most valuable company in the index By then Facebook alone accounted for nearly 2 percent of the S  P  500 index  which means that anyone who owns a broad based stock mutual fund or index fund probably owns Facebook shares  Sophisticated investors and institutions  too  have considerable exposure  Goldman Sachs analysts reported last month that Facebook was the second most widely held stock  after Amazon  by hedge funds Over 90 percent of Wall Street analysts covering the company deemed Facebook a  buy  in early February  even though  at  195 a share  its price to earnings ratio  a common valuation measure  was a lofty 35   The average ratio now is about 24  historically  it has been about 15  It was  as Wall Street pundits like to say   priced for perfection  Whatever else can be said about Facebook s recent tribulations  this much is certain  Its situation is far from perfection After revelations that data harvested from Facebook may have been used to try to influence Britain s vote to leave the European Union and the United States presidential election  the social network giant faces multiple investigations in both Europe and the United States  along with potentially profit crimping regulations and limits to its use of data  And investor retribution has been swift Since hitting its peak on Feb  2  Facebook has lost an astonishing  100 billion in market capitalization  Its stock was trading midweek at close to  153 a share  a decline of nearly 22 percent   It rebounded by about 4 5 percent Thursday and closed at  159 79  With Facebook s plunge  investor concerns have spread to other social media and internet stocks with lofty multiples  like the so called FANG stocks   Facebook  Apple and Amazon  Netflix and Google   and Twitter  They accounted for more than 10 percent of the S  P  500 at their peak  People who own an index fund need to realize how important Facebook is  and how big a role it and the FANG stocks played in the market s rise   said Howard Silverblatt  senior industry analyst for the S  P  Dow Jones Indices  who oversees statistical analysis for the S  P  500   The FANG leadership is faltering  Social media hasn t faced much regulation  and now there s a cloud hanging over those companies  In the midst of past Facebook euphoria  few saw this coming  One that did was Aiera  a robot that uses artificial intelligence to make stock recommendations  Aiera  an acronym for artificially intelligent equity research analyst  put out a  sell  recommendation for Facebook last fall So did Brian Wieser  a senior analyst at Pivotal Research Group  who covers media and internet companies  Although he was positive about the stock for most of its long climb  he downgraded Facebook to  sell  last summer based on regulatory and advertiser concerns and what he now considers  systemic management issues  Not only was it a lonely position  but  the stock went up and up   Mr  Wieser told me this week   But I thought the market was wrong  full stop   I didn t know what the catalyst would be  but at some point revenue growth had to slow and the margins go down   he said   There are practical limits  And I felt investors were looking at Facebook in much too positive a light  They just ignored all the bad things  and there were a lot of them  Then  when the news broke this month that a British firm  Cambridge Analytica  had used Facebook data for voter profiling  Mr  Wieser said  he thought it was  the most significant thing that had happened to Facebook since it became a public company   Most people hadn t given much thought to how their data is used   he added   But this really exposed the potential abuse  This is digital advertising s original sin  and there s going to be a reckoning that even now I don t think most investors fully appreciate  The other Facebook skeptic  Aiera  can talk  but Wells Fargo   whose global internet analyst  Ken Sena  developed the robot along with Bryan Healey   wasn t making its wunderkind available for interviews  But based on Aiera s published comments  it issued its sell recommendation after analyzing the frequency of negative mentions in the media of Russia s use of Facebook to influence the presidential election  as well as fundamental valuation and technical factors   Aiera uses artificial intelligence to read and analyze a half million pieces of data per day gleaned from the internet  It currently analyzes more than 1 600 stocks  Wells Fargo has stressed that Aiera remains in experimental mode  but one potential advantage is that it removes all human emotion from its analysis  Thus  Aiera was indifferent to the fact that nearly every other analyst had a buy recommendation on Facebook That included her putative master  Mr  Sena  who was thrust into the somewhat awkward position of explaining his own buy recommendation even as Aiera said sell When I spoke to him this week  Mr  Sena stressed that Aiera was a tool that could detect patterns and eliminate bias   Aiera said election interference was a big deal  and it turned out it was a big deal   Mr  Sena said   But it s not meant to supplant human judgments  He hasn t changed his buy recommendation even though he agrees with Mr  Wieser that investors need to take threats of regulation seriously   The conventional wisdom was that people don t care that much about how their data is used   Mr  Sena said   They like the convenience of targeted advertising  But the level of public outcry over this is new    Facebook is going to have to do a lot of explaining    he added   I believe they have the capability and the technology to make the platform secure  But it s going to distract from other initiatives investors are counting on for growth  like virtual reality and video content  Even so  Facebook s decline has been so steep that even Mr  Wieser and Aiera may reassess their recommendations if they calculate that the stock has bottomed out When he last reiterated his sell recommendation  Mr  Wieser s price target was  152   I don t want to be trigger happy on this   he said   It s not clear yet what happens next  I want to fine tune my thoughts before I revisit this  Aiera canceled her sell recommendation after the stock plunged  She hasn t yet made a new recommendation  Of 45 analysts who cover Facebook  41 currently have a  buy  or  overweight  recommendation  up from 39 a month ago Mr  Sena is even more bullish on Facebook than he was before  and hasn t changed his price target of  230   People are still glued to Facebook and Instagram   he said Its price to earnings ratio is now just 28  barely above the market average  which makes it  the cheapest stock in our coverage area  and it has some of the best growth prospects   he said   There s no way mathematically to justify a loss of more than  70 billion in market cap  
NEW DELHI    India s government has sent a notice to Facebook asking whether the personal data of Indian voters and users has been compromised by U K  based Cambridge Analytica or any other downstream entity A similar notice was dispatched to Cambridge Analytica last week following media reports that it had misused data to profile Indians and influence their elections  The government set a Saturday deadline for Cambridge Analytica and April 7 for Facebook to respond to its inquiry Facebook is facing unprecedented scrutiny following reports that the data mining firm used ill gotten data from tens of millions of its users to try to influence elections India s Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology said in a statement late Wednesday that Facebook has its largest footprint in India in terms of its user base and sought to know  what proactive measures it is taking to ensure the safety  security and privacy of such large user data and to prevent its misuse by any third party  The governing Bharatiya Janata Party and the main opposition Congress Party have accused each other of utilizing the services of the British company  but denied any link with it  Cambridge Analytica s allegedly unauthorized harvesting of Facebook data and a series of leaks linked to India s biometric database has refocused public attention on digital privacy in the country Digital law experts say Indian regulations offered particularly weak safeguards against data breach The Indian government s notice to Facebook sought to know  whether Facebook or its related or downstream agencies utilizing Facebook s data have previously been engaged by any entities to manipulate the Indian electoral process   If any such downstream entity misused data from Facebook  what is the protection available to the data subject   it asked

SAN FRANCISCO    Facebook Inc said on Thursday it had begun  fact checking  photos and videos to reduce the hoaxes and false news stories that have plagued the world s largest social media network Facebook has for months faced an uproar among users whose complaints range from the spread of fake news to the use of the network to manipulate elections and the harvesting of 50 million people s Facebook data by the political consultancy Cambridge Analytica Manipulated photos and videos are another growing problem on social media The fact checking began on Wednesday in France with assistance from the news organization AFP and will soon expand to more countries and partners  Tessa Lyons  a product manager at Facebook  said in a briefing with reporters Lyons did not say what criteria Facebook or AFP would use to evaluate photos and videos  or how much a photo could be edited or doctored before it is ruled fake The project is part of  efforts to fight false news around elections   she said A representative for AFP could not immediately be reached for comment Shares of Facebook closed up 4 4 percent at  159 79 on Thursday after a tumultuous two weeks  It remained down more than 13 percent from March 16  when Facebook disclosed the Cambridge Analytica data leak and sparked fears of stricter regulation Facebook has tried other ways to stem the spread of fake news  It has used third party fact checkers to identify them  and then given such stories less prominence in the Facebook News Feed when people share links to them In January  Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said Facebook would prioritize  trustworthy  news by using member surveys to identify high quality outlets Samidh Chakrabarti  another Facebook product manager  said in the briefing that the company had begun to  proactively  look for election related disinformation rather than waiting for reports from users  helping it to move more quickly Alex Stamos  Facebook s chief security officer  said in the briefing that the company was concerned not only about false facts but also other kinds of fakery He said Facebook wanted to reduce  fake audiences   which he described as using  tricks  to artificially expand the perception of support for a particular message  as well as  false narratives   such as headlines and language that  exploit disagreements   Reporting by David Ingram  Editing by Richard Chang 
MENLO PARK  Calif      We ve made a bunch of mistakes     Everyone needs complete control over who they share with at all times     Not one day goes by when I don t think about what it means for us to be the stewards of this community and their trust  Sound familiar  It s Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg addressing a major privacy breach   seven years ago  Lawmakers in many countries may be focused on Cambridge Analytica s alleged improper use of Facebook data  but the social network s privacy problems go back more than a decade  Here are some of the company s most notable missteps and promises around privacy 2007The social media darling unveils its Facebook Platform to great fanfare  Zuckerberg says app developers can now access the web of connections between users and their friends  a set of connections Facebook calls the  social graph   The social graph is changing the way the world works   he says  That November  Facebook launches Beacon   which shares what users are doing on other websites with their Facebook friends  Many users find it intrusive and difficult to disable  Massachusetts resident Sean Lane buys his wife a diamond ring for Christmas on Overstock com  but Facebook ruins the surprise   an incident leading to a class action lawsuit In December  Zuckerberg apologizes and enables users to shut off Beacon   I know we can do better   he says  2008Facebook launches Facebook Connect   aiming to correct Beacon s mistakes by requiring users to take deliberate action before they share activity from other websites when logged in using Facebook  More than 100 websites use the tool at launch  including CNN and TripAdvisor 2009Facebook announces  privacy improvements  after a yearlong review by Canada s Office of the Privacy Commissioner found that it geared its default privacy settings toward openness  failed to inform users their data would be used to serve ads  and leaked data to third party developers  including when their friends used apps  Facebook vows to encourage  users to review their privacy settings  but does not agree to all the recommendations Beacon is officially shut down  settling Lane s class action lawsuit The American Civil Liberties Union warns people that Facebook s default settings mean that when a friend uses an app or takes a quiz  the quiz  or app maker can peer into your profile  even if you ve made it private 2010App makers exhibit a sophisticated grasp of data they can scoop from Facebook s social graph The Wall Street Journal reports that many popular apps are transmitting personalized Facebook data to dozens of advertising and internet companies  among them  Zynga s breakout game FarmVille  Facebook responds by shutting down some apps Prior to the Journal report  Facebook says it has redesigned its privacy tools  giving its 400 million users  the power to control exactly who can see the information and content they share 2011The Federal Trade Commission reaches a consent decree with Facebook after an investigation of its broken privacy promises to consumers The FTC alleges  among other things  that  Facebook made its users  friend lists public in December 2009  even if they had been set to private  without telling them  Even if users limited data sharing to  friends only   data was actually shared with third party apps that friends used  Facebook failed to verify the security of apps it put on a  verified apps  list  Facebook promised not to share personal information with advertisers  but did Facebook promises to submit to a privacy audit every two years for the next 20 years  and Zuckerberg owns up to mistakes 2012Facebook introduces new methods to help advertisers reach people in ways  that protect your privacy   including an encryption tool called Custom Audiences that lets marketers match the email addresses of sales leads to the addresses that Facebook users used to set up their accounts Facebook also rolls out new privacy tools aimed at simplifying its convoluted and confusing privacy controls  Among other things  it narrows the scope of app permissions so they don t suck in as much user data automatically 2013Facebook shares two year old anonymized data on billions of friendships between countries with Cambridge researcher Aleksandr Kogan and co authors a research paper with him  published in 2015  Kogan creates a quiz app  installed by around 300 000 people   giving him access to tens of millions of their friends  data 2014Facebook says it dramatically limits the access apps have to friend data  preventing the type of data scoop Kogan and others were capable of  It also requires developers to get approval from Facebook before accessing sensitive data 2015Facebook says it learns from Guardian journalists that Kogan has shared data with Cambridge Analytica in violation of its policies  It bans the app and asks Kogan and Cambridge Analytica to certify they had deleted the data It rolls out  Security Checkup    a new tool aimed at simplifying its convoluted and confusing privacy controls 2017Facebook introduces  Privacy Basics    a Frequently Asked Questions site aimed at simplifying its privacy controls 2018Facebook says it learns from The Guardian and other media outlets that Cambridge Analytica did not delete improperly obtained Facebook data and suspends the company  Kogan  and whistleblower Christopher Wylie from its service Zuckerberg tells CNN that  I m really sorry that this happened   He promises to audit app makers that gathered massive amounts of data prior to 2014 and to notify affected users  Amid calls for investigations in the U S  and U K   the FTC begins investigating whether Facebook broke its 2011 consent decree  Our responsibility now is to make sure that this doesn t happen again   Zuckerberg says Facebook redesigns its privacy settings menu on mobile devices and says in a blog post   It s time to make our privacy tools easier to find     
NEW YORK    The author of a provocative Facebook memo declaring that growth is justified even if it costs lives says he doesn t actually agree with the memo and wrote it to provoke debate The 2016 internal memo  titled  The Ugly   was leaked to BuzzFeed this week  In it  Facebook executive Andrew Bosworth said  all the work we do in growth is justified   even if it costs people their lives because they are exposed to bullies or die in a terrorist attack coordinated through Facebook Bosworth  who goes by  Boz   has been at Facebook since 2006 and serves as the company s vice president in charge of virtual  and augmented reality efforts  Previously  he was vice president of ads and helped create Facebook features such as Messenger  its news feed and groups Bosworth tweeted Thursday that the memo was one of the most unpopular things he s written internally  and  the ensuing debate helped shape our tools for the better  In a statement to BuzzFeed that Facebook confirmed  CEO Mark Zuckerberg called Bosworth a  talented leader who says many provocative things   but added the memo was something  that most people at Facebook including myself disagreed with strongly   We ve never believed the ends justify the means   Zuckerberg said in the statement   We recognize that connecting people isn t enough by itself  We also need to work to bring people closer together  We changed our whole mission and company focus to reflect this last year  Facebook is grappling with an unprecedented crisis over allegations that Cambridge Analytica  a Trump affiliated political consulting firm  obtained data of tens of millions of users without their permission with the intent of swaying elections  That followed a string of scandals  including revelations that Russia used its platform to meddle in U S  elections Facebook is facing new questions about its practice of collecting call and text histories from Android devices  The company has not provided details on why it needed this data or what it did with it  saying only that it was used to improve people s experience on Facebook  It s not clear how the data collection made Facebook users  experience better on Android devices when Facebook couldn t get the same data from iPhones 
NEW YORK    Facebook s decision to stop working with third party data collectors might earn it public relations points  but it does little to protect your privacy  The social network still has more than enough data on your interests and hobbies to target ads with precision The company will still tap browser and device IDs to track visits to third party sites and apps  And it will have lots more information from your use of its service   everything from the businesses and hobbies you  like  to the types of news articles you read and share  The data helps Facebook create profile targets   such as college educated mothers in Detroit who like ice cream and the band Coldplay   for advertisers to reach Limiting its partnership with data brokers also doesn t touch on the difficulty Facebook has had keeping your data out of the hands of other companies  The social network is in the spotlight following accusations that a data mining firm used ill gotten data from tens of millions of Facebook users to try to influence elections Facebook may try to defuse that criticism by saying it s backing off on some data use  said Jon Reily  vice president of commerce strategy at the digital consulting company SapientRazorfish  But  he noted   they didn t need that sixth wheel on a car anyway  In a clear sign of who needs whom more  shares of Acxiom  a leading data collector that Facebook had contracted with  tumbled 19 percent Thursday  Facebook s stock saw a 4 percent gain  reversing some of the big losses it s suffered since the scandal involving Cambridge Analytica  a Trump affiliated consulting firm  broke almost two weeks ago Late Wednesday  Facebook said it was shutting down a type of advertising product that allowed marketers to use data from people s offline lives to target them on Facebook  The information includes categories like home ownership and purchase history and comes from some of the world s largest data brokers  including Acxiom  Epsilon and Experian  The decision came on the same day Facebook said it would make it easier to use its privacy controls and to see the data the company collects on its users These data brokers have troves of data on credit scores  family status  pet ownership and hobbies  which they glean from surveys  warrantee cards  retail loyalty programs and other sources  Brokers typically don t have a direct relationship with consumers  and how they get the data is often questionable  said Peter Reinhardt  CEO of Segment  a consumer data firm  Removing these brokers is a no brainer  as they add very little incremental value to advertisers and a lot of rightful scrutiny to Facebook   Reinhardt said Facebook said shutting down the advertising feature over the next six months  will help improve people s privacy on Facebook   But it wouldn t have stopped Cambridge Analytica from grabbing data inappropriately through an app that purported to be a research tool  Though Facebook has clamped down on apps  ability to get data on your friends  it still lets apps collect plenty of data on you  That isn t changing with Wednesday s moves And even without direct access to the brokers  data  Facebook was already able to build prediction models based on it  said Kenneth Sanford  lead analytics architect at the data science company Dataiku  So Facebook could use that model to ascertain other characteristics of people who buy Purina cat food  even if Facebook no longer gets data on which users indeed bought Purina  In the beginning  Facebook had a tremendous value in knowing those things they didn t otherwise know   Sanford said   Over time  they ve been able to accumulate that information  Besides data brokers  which will lose a source of revenue  advertisers who don t already have a lot of insights on their own customers might suffer in the short term  Debra Aho Williamson  principal analyst at the research firm eMarketer  said those advertisers might cut their spending on Facebook temporarily  but Facebook will try to shift them to its many other methods of ad targeting Losing access to purchase history could hurt some advertisers  If Purina wants to target cat lovers on Facebook  it might not know that your spouse does the actual buying   and that any advertising targeted at you might be wasted  But experts think such advertisers will just find other sources for that data to restore such insights David Ciancio  senior customer strategist at the data science specialist Dunnhumby  said the change means little more than  an extra step for advertisers   The effects on Facebook  he said  will be  relatively marginal     AP Technology Writer Barbara Ortutay contributed to this report 
 Reuters    Shares of Acxiom Corp plunged as much as 34 percent on Thursday  after Facebook Inc said it would end its partnerships with several large data brokers who help advertisers target people on the social network The stock has now lost nearly half of its market value since Facebook s comments on Wednesday that added to fears of increased scrutiny around how public data is handled and shared Facebook is under pressure to improve how it manages data after disclosing that information on about 50 million Facebook users wrongly ended up in the hands of political consultancy Cambridge Analytica The social network has for years given advertisers the option of targeting their ads based on data collected by companies such as Acxiom  Facebook s website lists nine third party data providers that it has worked with  including Acxiom  Experian PLC  Oracle Data Cloud  TransUnion and WPP PLC Arkansas based Acxiom  which earns over  800 million a year selling consumer profiles to the world s largest companies  said late on Wednesday it did not expect this change to impact its revenue or earnings for the year ending in March However  for fiscal year 2019  Acxiom expects total revenue and profitability to be hurt by as much as  25 million  The immediate impact was small  Now the question is how far does Facebook react to its issues   First Analysis analyst Larry Berlin said  A lot of what  Acxiom  is doing is probably not wrong and probably not at the core of the problem that Facebook has  Targeting consumers using data is sometimes very clean and sometimes it isn t  Even with little raw data  third party data providers like  Acxiom attempt to build detailed pictures of individuals  finances  relationships  personal interests and purchasing tastes These profiles power targeted advertising across the internet  and can also be used to determine what political issues people are interested in and how they might vote  I welcome Facebook s announcement that it will be shutting down its partner category service  using third party data to inform targeted advertising   said Britain s Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham in a statement on Thursday WPP  Experian  TransUnion and Cisco did not immediately respond to requests for comment Shares of Acxiom were down 32 percent at  19 by midday  The stock touch its lowest in more than 2 years in early trading TransUnion fell nearly 1 percent  while WPP was down marginally  Reporting by Sonam Rai in Bengaluru  Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty 
LONDON    I m 57  with a 30 year old wife  a fairly new hot water boiler  an old style television  a petrol car and no kids Actually  none of that is true  But that is what you might believe if you purchased access to my data from the world s largest information broker by market value The recent revelation that data miner Cambridge Analytica Ltd  improperly accessed 50 million Facebook users  personal data has heightened public concern about the way companies harvest and use our personal data I asked Arkansas based Acxiom Corp   which earns over  800 million a year selling consumer profiles to the world s largest companies  what data and insights it held on me In Europe and the U S   companies like Acxiom are allowed to collect data from public and other sources about us  European privacy rules  which are due to be strengthened in coming months  require all data gatherers to disclose to any European who asks what information they hold on them  U S  law doesn t give Americans the right to this level of disclosure The result of my inquiry shows how  even with little raw data  companies attempt to build detailed pictures of individuals  finances  relationships  personal interests and purchasing tastes These profiles now power the elaborate machinery that delivers advertising across the internet  and can also be used to determine what political issues people are interested in and how they might vote The question is  How accurate are the pictures they sketch  AFFLUENT FUN SEEKER Acxiom   like its rivals   operates by gathering publicly available information from sources like the electoral roll  which gives individuals  addresses  and land registry data  which provides details on home ownership such as purchase price and if there is a mortgage on the property It also buys data from companies that conduct online surveys  as well as websites where you forgot to tick  don t share with third parties  and other sources  This data is then put into a proprietary model  which produces a list of data points and propensities  such as the likelihood a consumer might visit a betting shop Acxiom sells access to these profiles to companies that wish to target advertising at potential customers  Acxiom doesn t have a political arm like Cambridge Analytica does  but the two companies do compete for commercial customers Facebook  in the wake of the scandal over how it handles personal information  said on Wednesday it would end its partnerships with several large data brokers who help advertisers target people on the social network  Shares in Acxiom traded down more than 10 percent to  25 following Facebook s announcement The results for a single individual obviously don t tell us too much about the accuracy of a database that Acxiom says contains 47 million UK profiles and insights into 700 million consumers worldwide Also  it seems I am a bad data subject since I usually opt out when asked to give companies data sharing rights  Where we have more self reported  privacy compliant data about individuals  we can be more accurate  In your case  we held very little of this data and the majority of the variables linked to you  are modelled  based on both your postcode and the household history   Acxiom said in a statement My Acxiom profile has around 750 individual data fields under a dozen categories from  household composition  to  employment   income  and  lifestyle   interests   It categorizes me as an  affluent fun seeker    The accuracy of that description depends on your definition  I suppose  but some of the information is plain wrong To start with  I m 46 years old  not 57  I won t reveal my wife s age  but I will confirm that when I got married at age 34  it wasn t to a teenager  Two children mean we re not  empty nesters   I drive a diesel car and our boiler is more than 15 years old  not less than five years as Acxiom identifies it as That could be a disappointment for the companies including Tesco supermarket  Twitter  Ford Motor Company and Facebook to whom Acxiom said it may have provided my data in the past year  Or maybe not PROFILE ERRORSThe fact that my profile contains errors isn t necessarily a problem for marketers said Carol Hargreaves  a professor and director of the Data Analytics Consulting Center at the National University of Singapore What really matters is the predictions of one s behavior  interests and propensity to buy certain kinds of products  The things you sell to a male of 46 or a male of 57 are the same   Hargreaves said In some potentially key areas  the data is certainly better than a random guess  It predicted that I had just a 5 2 percent probability of being self employed  rather than employed  Official data shows around 17 percent of Britons are self employed Acxiom s prediction of my household income was also much closer to the actual number than the average published by the Greater London Authority for my electoral ward  or local electoral district  the narrowest official estimate But if purchase decisions are driven by lifestyle interests  the data collected on me is of little use to marketers My predicted annual car mileage was 8 000 to 10 000 miles  based on  modelled probability   This figure echoes the 8 405 miles that car breakdown group the RAC says the average London motorist drives each year  But it s over twice my annual mileage Acxiom incorrectly says I don t have a flat screen television  something it  derived through modeling   even though a UK government report from 2013 says most households do One in seven Britons is a member of a gym  according to a 2017 industry survey  Acxiom reckons there s a 47 5 percent chance that I am interested in belonging to a gym  My last subscription expired over a decade ago Acxiom also thinks I am more likely to be interested in crossword puzzles   I haven t done one since the 1980s   than in current affairs  which has been my working life for 20 years On the positive side  there are indications Acxiom doesn t engage in racial profiling  The company predicts I have a 13 6 percent probability of interest in regularly going to a bar  I asked Hargreaves  the professor  if this seemed a statistically reasonable estimate for an Irish journalist  After she stopped laughing  Hargreaves said accurate predictions hinged on the raw data on which the profile is based BAND WAGONAcxiom said individual inaccuracies didn t undermine the value of its service  We know from working with leading brands  that data helps them deliver more accurate and relevant marketing to customers at scale    The key factor here is   at scale    it said in a statement Annabel Kilner  Chief Commercial Officer at furniture retailer MADE com said consumer data helped firms deliver messages that consumers found relevant  We adopt a test and learn approach to optimizing our campaigns   Kilner said Xiaojing Dong  associate professor of marketing and business analytics at Santa Clara University in Silicon Valley  said that qualitative predictions like those produced by Acxiom gave advertisers a much better idea of who they are reaching But Hargreaves said there was concern among some advertisers that the consumer profiles they purchase from data aggregators may not always be worth the large fees involved  Hargreaves said she is about to start working with clients of companies like Acxiom to ascertain whether they were getting value for money  Some of the data vendors are just jumping on the band wagon   she said The key to accurate profiling  experts said  was good raw data  The best is held by those companies with whom we have the deepest interactions   social media giants like Facebook or Twitter and retailers like Amazon com Stephan Lewandowsky  a professor of cognitive psychology at the University of Bristol in Britain  said that explains why companies like Cambridge Analytica would be so eager to access Facebook data  The difference between using the electoral roll and Facebook is that the information we reveal on Facebook is sufficient for a computer program to infer our personality with greater accuracy than our own spouse   he

SAN FRANCISCO   Facebook employees were in an uproar on Friday over a leaked 2016 memo from a top executive defending the social network s growth at any cost   even if it caused deaths from a terrorist attack that was organized on the platform In the memo  Andrew Bosworth  a Facebook vice president  wrote   Maybe someone dies in a terrorist attack coordinated on our tools  And still we connect people  The ugly truth is that we believe in connecting people so deeply that anything that allows us to connect more people more often is  de facto  good  Mr  Bosworth and Facebook s chief executive  Mark Zuckerberg  have since disavowed the memo  which was published on Thursday by BuzzFeed News But the fallout at the Silicon Valley company has been wide  According to two Facebook employees  workers have been calling on internal message boards for a hunt to find those who leak to the media  Some have questioned whether Facebook has been transparent enough with its users and with journalists  said the employees  who asked not to be identified for fear of retaliation  Many are also concerned over what might leak next and are deleting old comments or messages that might come across as controversial or newsworthy  they said The brouhaha follows a period of intense scrutiny for Facebook and questions over what its responsibilities are to its more than 2 2 billion users  The company has been grappling this month with revelations that a British political consulting firm  Cambridge Analytica  improperly harvested data from 50 million of the social network s users  Mr  Zuckerberg has since been on an apology tour over data privacy and is expected to testify before lawmakers in Washington Facebook did not respond to a request for comment over employees  reaction to the leaked memo In the aftermath  some Facebook executives have taken to Twitter for a public charm offensive  sending pithy phrases and emoticons to reporters who cover the company  Adam Mosseri  Facebook s head of news feed  in recent days wrote unprompted to a BuzzFeed editor and to its chief executive reminiscing and telling a story about his mother  He also wrote to a reporter from the Verge tech site about the songs played at his wedding reception In some of his tweets  Mr  Mosseri also defended Facebook  When writers from Vox and BuzzFeed tweeted that they noticed that stories critical of Facebook were receiving surprisingly low levels of traffic on Facebook  Mr  Mosseri jumped in  We 100  do not take any action on stories for being critical of us   he tweeted Mr  Bosworth  the author of the 2016 memo  also took to Twitter  Late Thursday  he said he did not agree with what he wrote in the memo  and I didn t agree with it even when I wrote it   He added that  the purpose of this post  like many others I have written internally  was to bring to the surface issues I felt deserved more discussion with the broader company  After BuzzFeed published the memo  Mr  Bosworth deleted it from an internal message board where it had originally been posted  In a statement to BuzzFeed  Mr  Zuckerberg praised Mr  Bosworth as  a talented leader who says many provocative things  and said that he and most people at Facebook did not agree with the memo and that the company had realized that it could not just be about connecting people Facebook employees said on Friday that discussions were raging across the company regarding the merits of the post  Some called for executives to aggressively pursue action against those leaking to the media  said two Facebook employees  as well as for the company to do more to screen for potential whistle blowers during the hiring process At least one former Facebook employee  Alec Muffett  wrote on Twitter that Mr  Bosworth s memo was responsible for his decision to leave the company  Between overwork and leadership direction evidenced thusly  I could never stay   wrote Mr  Muffett  who formerly worked as a Facebook engineer  There are some amazing engineers working at Facebook  folks who care deeply about user privacy  security  and how people will use the code that they write   Mr  Muffett said later in a message   Alas this episode may not help  to achieve more transparent internal product discussion  he said

administration  taking a leading role in challenging the president s policies in court and trying to chip away at the Republicans  grip on state governments  Mr  Holder discussed his efforts to fight Republican gerrymandering  whether Facebook should be regulated and the potential legacy of Mr  Trump s presidency in a wide ranging TimesTalks conversation with the reporter Alexander Burns on Wednesday night in New York Here are the takeaways After the Trump administration announced this week that it would add a question about citizenship to the 2020 census  Mr  Holder said he planned to sue to block the change on behalf of the National Democratic Redistricting Committee  which he chairs  The census aims to count everyone who resides in the country  whether they are citizens or not  and Mr  Holder echoed the concerns expressed by several states this week that the citizenship question could reduce the responses from noncitizens and even legal immigrants He said his lawsuit would be aided by Mr  Trump s Twitter utterances  This is one of those incidences where I think the president s tweets and public statements will become relevant   Mr  Holder  67  said   To show the true intent   that it is not as benign as they would make it out to be  Through the words of Donald Trump and through the tweets of Donald Trump  you ll see what the true intention was of the administration  Normally  he noted  it would be difficult to argue in court that the government pushed a policy with a malicious intent  But Mr  Trump s tweets provide plenty of material for lawsuits  Mr  Holder said  It is certainly the gift that keeps on giving   he said Mr  Holder conceded that he prefers Twitter to Facebook but occasionally catches a glimpse of Facebook when his wife signs on  But he said he had been following the recent news that a British political consulting firm  Cambridge Analytica  improperly harvested the information of 50 million Facebook users That security breach  along with the social network s role in spreading Russian backed propaganda during the presidential election  bolstered an argument for regulating Facebook  Mr  Holder said  There needs to be a certain degree of freedom   he said   We don t want to stifle the creativity that comes from those platforms  But he added   There is a way in which we have to think of these platforms as communication companies  What then does that mean in terms of how they should be regulated  Mr  Holder  who served as the attorney general from February 2009 to April 2015  said he was stunned by the support Mr  Trump still enjoyed in some circles after a pornographic film star and a former Playboy model claimed they had sexual relationships with him  I find it hard to believe the conversations that we have about the conduct of this president  They are mind blowing   he said   I think to myself  You gave my guy grief because he wore a tan suit  Mr  Holder said that if the same allegations of extramarital affairs had been made against Mr  Obama or President George W  Bush  their presidencies would have been over   I just don t understand how this has not had the reaction generated that would have been generated by any other president   he said Mr  Trump has nominated Mike Pompeo  the director of the C I A   to be the next secretary of state and named a veteran of the spy agency  Gina Haspel  as the next director  Both nominations require Senate confirmation  and Ms  Haspel will certainly face questions about her work as a clandestine officer in the agency s counterterrorism operations  She oversaw a secret prison in Thailand involved in the rendition  detention and interrogation of detainees In 2012  Mr  Holder effectively closed that dark chapter in the C I A  s history  announcing that a three year Justice Department investigation into brutal interrogations was ending without a prosecution  The decision outraged some liberals On Wednesday night  Mr  Holder said that Ms  Haspel would have to answer tough questions   and that the public deserved to know more about the country s enhanced interrogation program  He said that parts of the Justice Department report and a separate Senate investigation into the program should be declassified  The American people need to know exactly what happened during that time period   he said Responding to recent calls for a repeal of the Second Amendment  Mr  Holder said such an effort was impracticable but offered four suggestions to address what he called a  gun violence epidemic in the United States   His remarks came days after John Paul Stevens  a retired associate justice of the United States Supreme Court  wrote an Op Ed in The Times advocating repeal Assault weapons should be banned  as well as higher capacity magazines  Mr  Holder said  Background checks should be expanded for prospective gun buyers  and the government should reinstate the funding of studies on gun violence by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  Compare us to any other nation  and we are just off the charts when it comes to mass shootings and the number of people killed through the use of firearms   Mr  Holder said   We have to do something about it  
SAN FRANCISCO   Two days after Donald J  Trump won the 2016 election  executives at Google consoled their employees in an all staff meeting broadcast around the world  There is a lot of fear within Google   said Sundar Pichai  the company s chief executive  according to a video of the meeting viewed by The New York Times  When asked by an employee if there was any silver lining to Mr  Trump s election  the Google co founder Sergey Brin said   Boy  that s a really tough one right now   Ruth Porat  the finance chief  said Mr  Trump s victory felt  like a ton of bricks dropped on my chest   Then she instructed members of the audience to hug the person next to them Sixteen months later  Google s parent company  Alphabet  has most likely saved billions of dollars in taxes on its overseas cash under a new tax law signed by Mr  Trump  Alphabet also stands to benefit from the Trump administration s looser regulations for self driving cars and delivery drones  as well as from proposed changes to the trade pact with Mexico and Canada that would limit Google s liability for user content on its sites Once one of Mr  Trump s most vocal opponents  Silicon Valley s technology industry has increasingly found common ground with the White House  When Mr  Trump was elected  tech executives were largely up in arms over a leader who espoused policies on immigration and other issues that were antithetical to their companies  values  Now  many of the industry s executives are growing more comfortable with the president and how his economic agenda furthers their business interests  even as many of their employees continue to disagree with Mr  Trump on social issues The relationship remains bumpy  Mr  Trump lashed out at Amazon on Twitter on Thursday  accusing the e commerce giant of evading taxes   Amazon said it had saved  789 million under the tax law Mr  Trump signed   The president is also expected to sign legislation   passed by the Senate last week  that would strengthen policing of sex trafficking online   a bill that internet companies once opposed because they worried it would make them liable for content posted by their users Yet quietly  the tech industry has warmed to the White House  especially as companies including Alphabet  Apple and Intel have benefited from the Trump administration s policies Those include lowering corporate taxes  encouraging development of new wireless technology like 5G and  so far  ignoring calls to break up the tech giants  Mr  Trump s tougher stance on China may also help ward off industry rivals  with the president squashing a hostile bid to acquire the chip maker Qualcomm this month  And Mr  Trump let die an Obama era rule that required many tech start ups to give some workers more overtime pay Mr  Trump  has been great for business and really  really good for tech   said Gary Shapiro  who leads the Consumer Technology Association  the largest American tech trade group  with more than 2 200 members including Apple  Google  Amazon and Facebook Mr  Shapiro said that he had voted for Hillary Clinton  Mr  Trump s opponent  in 2016  but that he and many tech executives had come around on Mr  Trump  While they disagree with him on immigration and the environment  they have found areas where their interests align  like deregulation and investment in internet infrastructure  This isn t Hitler or Mussolini here   Mr  Shapiro said  And even though the president s new tariffs on steel and aluminum could hurt American businesses and consumers   disagreement in one area does not mean we cannot work together in others   Mr  Shapiro said   Everyone who is married knows that  Mr  Trump himself has taken to naming tech companies he says are on his side After Apple took advantage of the new tax law in January to bring back most of the  252 billion cash hoard that it had parked overseas  the company said it would make a  350 billion  contribution to the U S  economy  over the next five years  That prompted Mr  Trump to suggest he had made good on a campaign pledge to get Apple to bring jobs back to the United States  You know  for  350 million  you could build a beautiful plant  But for  350 billion  they re going to build a lot of plants   the president told members of Congress last month  Mr  Trump said he had called Timothy D  Cook  Apple s chief executive  to personally thank him In fact  Apple has no plans to build a plant in the United States  The company is uneasy with Mr  Trump s invoking it to signify how his policies are working  according to a person close to Apple who was not authorized to speak publicly  Apple has not  however  publicly corrected the president Mr  Trump has also stayed quiet on the controversy engulfing Facebook over user privacy  while other politicians have called for more regulations after revelations that the British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica improperly harvested the information of 50 million Facebook users  Cambridge Analytica used that data to aid Mr  Trump s campaign Michael Kratsios  the White House s deputy chief technology officer  said in an interview that while Mr  Trump and Silicon Valley had their differences   in places where we do see eye to eye  I think we re achieving extraordinary success  Dean Garfield  head of the Information Technology Industry Council  a 102 year old advocacy group that represents the biggest tech firms  said his members walked a tightrope  supporting and opposing the president on different issues  Lately  he said   we have reached balance in the tightrope  The equilibrium marks a turnabout from what had been a testy relationship between Mr  Trump and the tech sector  On the campaign trail in 2016  Mr  Trump was so critical of tech companies that Jeff Bezos  Amazon s chief executive  once joked he might send Mr  Trump to space in a rocket Some tech executives have since disagreed with Mr  Trump on social issues  Mr  Cook emailed staff last June to say he had unsuccessfully lobbied the president to remain in the Paris climate accords  In November  Microsoft sued the administration to protect a law that blocks deportation of young undocumented immigrants known as Dreamers  More than 100 companies  including Google  Facebook and Uber  filed a brief supporting California s lawsuit on that issue Even so  tech executives worked to build a relationship with the president  with some meeting him at Trump Tower before his inauguration and again at the White House in June  While in Washington for the second meeting  Mr  Cook and Satya Nadella  Microsoft s chief executive  also dined with Jared Kushner  the president s senior adviser and son in law  and Ivanka Trump at the couple s Washington home  according to a person briefed on the meeting who wasn t authorized to speak publicly about it  This month  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin visited Apple s headquarters Silicon Valley has found plenty to like about the Trump presidency  In September  tech giants including Facebook and Microsoft teamed up with the administration to pledge  500 million to computer science education  Amazon  Microsoft and Google are also eyeing the administration as a potential customer as Mr  Trump pushes to modernize the government s digital infrastructure But Silicon Valley s favorite thing about Mr  Trump is almost certainly his new tax code  Many tech companies lobbied for corporate tax reform for years before Mr  Trump signed the new tax bill Tech giants immediately reaped the benefits  Under the new rules  Apple saved  43 7 billion in taxes  according to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy  a nonpartisan research group  Apple then announced the  350 billion  contribution  to the economy over five years Most of the tally was previously planned spending with American suppliers and a  38 billion tax payment on its overseas cash  But Apple also said it planned to hire 20 000 new workers  invest in new data centers and another domestic campus  and increase a fund for innovative American manufacturers to  5 billion from  1 billion  It also gave employees  2 500 bonuses The president was quick to tweet the news The shifting relationship between Silicon Valley and Mr  Trump appears to have upset some tech employees  A Facebook page called  Angry Googler   with nearly 1 000 followers  has been dedicated to criticizing Google for any sign it was cooperating with the president  Not happy about Google pulling a 180 and jumping into bed with Trump  Same here   said the  About  section of the page  which suggests it is run by a Google employee  This month  the page posted an article about Google helping the Defense Department analyze drone footage   We ve gone from organizing the world s information to   optimizing weapons of war   the page said Messages to the account were not returned  Google declined to comment Some tech firms remain discomfited about appearing as the president s allies  Last month  Rob Goldman  Facebook s vice president of advertising  played down Russia s impact on the 2016 election after the Justice Department charged 13 Russians with trying to subvert its outcome  including by using Facebook  Mr  Trump retweeted Mr  Goldman approvingly Facebook was uncomfortable with that association with the president  said a person close to the company who was not authorized to speak publicly Two days later  Facebook s policy chief  Joel Kaplan  distanced the company from Mr  Goldman s comments  The special counsel has issued its indictments  and nothing we found contradicts their conclusions   he said in a statement   Any suggestion otherwise is wrong  
SAN FRANCISCO   The contemporary internet was built on a bargain  Show us who you really are and the digital world will be free to search or share People detailed their interests and obsessions on Facebook and Google  generating a river of data that could be collected and harnessed for advertising  The companies became very rich  Users seemed happy  Privacy was deemed obsolete  like bloodletting and milkmen Now  the consumer surveillance model underlying Facebook and Google s free services is under siege from users  regulators and legislators on both sides of the Atlantic  It amounts to a crisis for an internet industry that up until now had taken a reactive  whack a mole approach to problems like the spread of fraudulent news and misuse of personal data The recent revelation that Cambridge Analytica  a voter profiling company that had worked with Donald J  Trump s presidential campaign  harvested data from 50 million Facebook users  raised the current uproar  even if the origins lie as far back as the 2016 election  It has been many months of allegations and arguments that the internet in general and social media in particular are pulling society down instead of lifting it up That has inspired a good deal of debate about more restrictive futures for Facebook and Google  At the furthest extreme  some dream of the companies becoming public utilities  More benign business models that depend less on ads and more on subscriptions have been proposed  although it s unclear why either company would abandon something that has made them so prosperous Congress might pass targeted legislation to restrict consumer data use in specific sectors  such as a Senate bill that would require increased transparency in online political advertising  said Daniel J  Weitzner  director of the Internet Policy Research Initiative at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology There are other avenues still  said Jascha Kaykas Wolff  the chief marketing officer of Mozilla  the nonprofit organization behind the popular Firefox browser  including advertisers and large tech platforms collecting vastly less user data and still effectively customizing ads to consumers  They are just collecting all the data to try to find magic growth algorithms   Mr  Kaykas Wolff said of online marketers  This past week  Mozilla halted its ads on Facebook  saying the social network s default privacy settings allowed access to too much data The greatest likelihood is that the internet companies  frightened by the tumult  will accept a few more rules and work a little harder for transparency  And there will be hearings on Capitol Hill The next chapter is also set to play out not in Washington but in Europe  where regulators have already cracked down on privacy violations and are examining the role of data in online advertising The Cambridge Analytica case  said Vera Jourova  the European Union commissioner for justice  consumers and gender equality  was not just a breach of private data   This is much more serious  because here we witness the threat to democracy  to democratic plurality   she said Although many people had a general understanding that free online services used their personal details to customize the ads they saw  the latest controversy starkly exposed the machinery Consumers  seemingly benign activities   their likes   could be used to covertly categorize and influence their behavior  And not just by unknown third parties  Facebook itself has worked directly with presidential campaigns on ad targeting  describing its services in a company case study as  influencing voters   People are upset that their data may have been used to secretly influence 2016 voters   said Alessandro Acquisti  a professor of information technology and public policy at Carnegie Mellon University   If your personal information can help sway elections  which affects everyone s life and societal well being  maybe privacy does matter after all  In interviews  Mr  Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg  Facebook s chief operating officer  seemed to accept the possibility of increased privacy regulation  something that would have been unlikely only a few months ago  But some trade group executives also warned that any attempt to curb the use of consumer data would put the business model of the ad supported internet at risk  You re undermining a fundamental concept in advertising  reaching consumers who are interested in a particular product   said Dean C  Garfield  chief executive of the Information Technology Industry Council  a trade group in Washington whose members include Amazon  Facebook  Google and Twitter If suspicion of Facebook and Google is a relatively new feeling in the United States  it has been embedded in Europe for historical and cultural reasons that date back to the Nazi Gestapo  the Soviet occupation of Eastern Europe and the Cold War  We re at an inflection point  when the great wave of optimism about tech is giving way to growing alarm   said Heather Grabbe  director of the Open Society European Policy Institute   This is the moment when Europeans turn to the state for protection and answers  and are less likely than Americans to rely on the market to sort out imbalances  In May  the European Union is instituting a comprehensive new privacy law  called the General Data Protection Regulation  The new rules treat personal data as proprietary  owned by an individual  and any use of that data must be accompanied by permission   opting in rather than opting out   after receiving a request written in clear language  not legalese Mélanie Voin  a spokeswoman for the European Commission  said the protection rules will have more teeth than the current 1995 directive  For example  a company experiencing a data breach involving individuals must notify the data protection authority within 72 hours and would be subject to fines of up to 20 million euros or 4 percent of its annual revenue In a January speech in Brussels  Facebook s Ms  Sandberg said   We know we can t just meet the G D P R   but we need to do even more   Google declined to comment The United States does not have a consumer privacy law like the General Data Protection Regulation  But after years of pushing for similar legislation  privacy groups said that recent events were giving them new momentum   and they were looking to Europe for inspiration  With the new European law  regulators for the first time have real enforcement tools   said Jeffrey Chester  the executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy  a nonprofit group in Washington   We now have a way to hold these companies accountable  But any ambitions for new rules may run into the realities of the tech industry Privacy advocates and even some United States regulators have long been concerned about the ability of online services to track consumers and make inferences about their financial status  health concerns and other intimate details to show them behavior based ads  They warned that such microtargeting could unfairly categorize or exclude certain people In 2010  for instance  the Federal Trade Commission proposed a new option for consumers  called Do Not Track  Two years later  the Barack Obama administration introduced a blueprint for a Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights  intended to give Americans more control over what personal details companies collected from them and how the data was used But the Do Not Track effort and the privacy bill were both stymied Industry groups successfully argued that collecting personal details posed no harm to consumers and that efforts to hinder data collection would chill innovation  Instead  the advertising industry created a program to allow consumers to opt out of having their data used for customized ads  although it does not allow people to entirely opt out of having their data collected  If it can be shown that the current situation is actually a market failure and not an individual company failure  then there s a case to be made for federal regulation  under certain circumstances  said Randall Rothenberg  chief executive of the Interactive Advertising Bureau  a trade group The business practices of Facebook and Google were reinforced by the fact that no privacy flap lasted longer than a news cycle or two  Nor did people flee for other services  That convinced the companies that digital privacy was a dead issue If the current furor dies down without meaningful change  critics worry that the problems might become even more entrenched  When the tech industry follows its natural impulses  it becomes even less transparent That would hamper any long term understanding of the relationship between social media and political views  an urgent question in Germany  Myanmar  Sri Lanka  the United States and many other places  To know the real interaction between populism and Facebook  you need to give much more access to researchers  not less   said Paul Jasper Dittrich  a German research fellow in digital economy at the Jacques Delors Institute There s another reason Silicon Valley tends to be reluctant to share information about what it is doing  It believes so deeply in itself that it does not even think there is a need for discussion  The technology world s remedy for any problem is always more technology  If Facebook and Google were merely interested in maximizing profits  we could regulate them   said Maciej Ceglowski  who runs Tech Solidarity  a labor advocacy group   But well intentioned people can break things not easy to fix  It s like a child running a bulldozer  They don t have any sense of the damage they can do  
Wait  a new season of  RuPaul s Drag Race   already  Didn t we all just watch a finale last week  Why  yes we did   and many of us are still  as the children say  shooketh One short week ago  Season 3 of  RuPaul s Drag Race All Stars  ended not with a bang but a limper  as Shangela  the leader in the polls  was thrown under the hot rod by an extralegally installed electoral body ody ody of her competitors  clearing the strip for the perfectly lovely but somewhat uninspired Trixie Mattel to hobble across the finish line   I look forward to Shangela s book   What Had Happened Was    The herstoric halls were left a disappointing  tepid mess Fortunately  an especially fierce 14 queen crew arrived Thursday night ready to clean up  Brooms  rubber gloves and sponges swept the workroom and the runway in a season premiere dedicated to celebrating the show s decaversary by unearthing and dusting off the gritty roots of drag  The past and the episode blasted open with Ru parroting the drag ball M C  Junior Labeija s iconic bark   Tens  tens  tens across the board  Thankfully not limping was the resurgent Eureka  prematurely ejected from the ninth season thanks to a jump split induced knee injury   Like a phoenix from the ashes  Eureka is back   she crowed  kissing the purple floor As the rest of the queens made their catchphrase addled entrances  the workroom atmosphere was refreshingly sunny  with only the slightest cast of shade Miz Cracker  one of an unprecedented five New York queens competing this season and a self identified  Barbie on bath salts   strutted in and

without being nabbed by cult recruiters Monét X Change  a New York mainstay  literally swept into the room wearing tearaway coveralls and wielding a broom  to sweep up the competition  girl   The Hollywood diva Mayhem Miller  who has auditioned  year after year after year   finally arrived in full Dreamgirls eleganza  and did not wait until eleven o clock to tell us that she is not going Chicago s The Vixen  looking like a drained Sears Tower souvenir snow globe  took a boxer s stance and announced   I m just here to fight   Is she already positioning herself to be the villain  Why do people still do that  Do villains ever win reality competitions The first mini challenge was a classic ball walk down the runway  which was rimmed with queens from seasons past  I see Adore and Detox  And Katya and Raven  I see trans former contestant Peppermint  Wait  Ru recently issued a controversial no transwomen decree  Did he award her a temporary work visa from the Forbidden Island Eureka

down the runway like a Chico State freshman who s just downed her first appletini  and The Vixen busted her skirt turning an impressive somersault  But Monét went legendary with the powder puff move made immortal by the late vogueing creator Willi Ninja  and snatched the win Back in the workroom  the New York queen Dusty Ray Bottoms  her face trademark punctuated with every period orphaned by her generation s texts  said   I was really  really  really trying to spot the booger  but everyone looks  expletive  fierce   It was an unfortunate metaphor  but it did articulate what we were thinking  This clutch of queens seems unusually strong  and it s hard to imagine who will be eliminated The maxi challenge  a remix of the first challenge from the show s first episode   Drag on a Dime   took us back to the beginnings of both the show and the scrappy art of drag itself  The Pit Crew wheeled in a 99 cent store s worth of pool noodles  dish sponges and assorted capitalist effluvia  from which the queens cobbled together an impressive array of looks and hit the runway Before the judging  Ru announced that another queen would be returning   No  it wasn t Shangela  She s walking in the

Aguilera did a quick bit that reminded us why  Burlesque  was her last notable acting job  then pulled out a hand held mic from seemingly nowhere and did a quick melismatic run  The queens swooned Mayhem  who crafted a cigarette girl ensemble out of latex gloves and trash bags  leaked tears when she was named the winner of the challenge  The judge and national treasure Ross Mathews soothed and

bottom two were Kalorie  correctly called on the carpet for her  million dollar dress  of generic Monopoly money hot glued to an ill fitting bustier  a fourth removed cousin of superior cash fronted

Michelle hissed  somehow turning into an insult the exact phrase I ve always dreamed a man would use to describe my body   They were ordered to lip sync for their lives to Ms  Aguilera s  Ain t No Other Man  Kalorie described herself as  the twerking queen   and she is not wrong  In a coup de grâce  she pulled a fistful of dollar bills from her bustier and made it rain on herself Vanessa s lip sync was a bit wan in comparison  and she was  sadly  the first bat to be plucked from the renovated cave  She bravely fought back tears as she sashayed away   I hope this isn t the last we see of her Ru declared at the top of the episode that the mission of  Drag Race  is to take over the world  and 10 years in  his coup seems to be just about complete  The show s stars have millions of fans and fill performance halls in red states  with teenage girls cosplaying as their favorite queens  RuPaul has built a juggernaut on the wigs of queens old enough not just to be this season s drag mothers  but their birth mothers But with great power comes great Ru sponsibility  Drag is currently a cultural Bitcoin  and it seems that in its peaking moment  it will either permanently tuck itself into the mainstream or pop back into the bubbles  Heavy will be the head that eventually wears this season s crown  But this crop of girls seems especially fun and smart  with good wigs on their padded shoulders  and I trust that one of them will responsibly lead us to the midterms  I look forward to spending my spring in their company Will Eureka make it through this season on both feet  Will The Vixen collude with a group of Russian drag queens and take the crown in an upset  Will a remake of  Burlesque  starring Farrah Moan and Cher alike All Star Chad Michaels finally be greenlit See you

Amazon did not pay state sales tax  but it does so now when it sells its own goods in states that collect it  It is the case  however  that in most states Amazon does not collect sales taxes on goods sold by third parties through its platform  As for the United States Postal Service  Amazon s business appears to be giving a welcome lift to its package shipping revenue Still  Amazon cannot quietly hope that such criticism just fades away  Amazon s rapid growth  immense bargaining power  eye catching initiatives and estimated 44 percent share of U S  e commerce sales make the company vulnerable to accusations that it is too powerful But if the Trump administration pursues ways to curtail the company  it would meet sizable obstacles Amazon accounts for only 4 percent of all retail sales in the United States  a recent survey estimated  Its revenue is a third of Walmart s and  even after its acquisition of Whole Foods  Amazon s footing in the grocery business is still small All in all  it would be hard to show that Amazon is pushing prices higher for consumers Amazon also has a loyal customer base   it has an estimated 90 million Prime members   and the public views it relatively favorably  When the Department of Justice s antitrust lawyers went after the proposed merger of Time Warner and AT T  it was not targeting companies that were particularly popular with the public Still  some Amazon critics see a possible  though small  opening  In theory  an antitrust case could focus on the firms that supply Amazon with goods  according to Christopher L  Sagers  a law professor at Cleveland State University  If a company consistently uses its power to demand a good from suppliers at too low a price  the public could still get hurt  That s because the supply of the good could decline  its quality degrade  and there may be less innovation in the sector that produces the good  Mr  Sagers said But anyone bringing that against Amazon would have to explain why Walmart would not be a target  too   Peter EavisThe investment adviser to New York City s pension funds is calling for changes to Facebook s board to address the fallout from Cambridge Analytica s improper harvesting of information from 50 million users of the social network New York City s comptroller  Scott M  Stringer  wrote in a letter addressed to Dr  Susan Desmond Hellmann  an independent director at Facebook and the chief executive of the Bill   Melinda Gates Foundation New York City s pension funds  which have more than  193 billion in assets under management  own  895 million of Facebook s shares  according to the letter  Even with the recent tumble in its shares  Facebook is valued at more than  450 billion In his letter  Mr  Stringer calls on Facebook s independent directors to take four steps to help restore investor confidence Here are the proposed changes 1  Add at least three new independent directors to improve the board s ability to oversee the evolving risks Facebook faces 2  Name an independent director as chairman  allowing Mark Zuckerberg  Facebook s chief executive and chairman  to focus on running the company 3  Create a committee of independent directors to oversee the company s data privacy policies and risks 4  Institute a clawback policy so that the board can  recoup executive pay in the event of violations of law  regulation or company policy  President Trump spoke out against Amazon on Thursday  saying that the online behemoth does not pay enough taxes and uses the United States postal system  as their Delivery Boy  The president s commentary  made in a Twitter post  comes amid reports that Mr  Trump has expressed an interest in reining in the e commerce business Amazon and the company s founder  Jeff Bezos  are among Mr  Trump s regular Twitter targets  In December  Mr  Trump questioned whether the United States Post Office charges Amazon enough for package deliveries  And in August  Mr  Trump said Amazon hurts taxpaying businesses Amazon  however  does pay taxes    412 million in 2016  for instance  according to the company s report to the Securities and Exchange Commission Axios reported on Wednesday that Mr  Trump has wondered aloud whether Amazon could be vulnerable to antitrust or competition laws Amazon shares fell more than 7 percent following that Axios article but recovered some of those losses after a White House official told Reuters that the company faced no particular policy changes  But the administration is always looking at its options  the official added  The stock closed down 4 4 percent Wednesday Shares were down nearly 2 percent in early trading Should shareholders worry  The GBH Insights analyst Daniel Ives told Bloomberg that this regulatory threat was unlikely to change Amazon s business model  but it was still  the last thing nervous tech investors wanted to see today  Retailers  at least  already have some reason to be cheerful And Amazon has another target market for expansion  housekeeping Corporate American will start reporting first quarter results in less than two weeks  and earnings are expected to be big Analysts estimate that profits at companies in the S  P  500 grew 17 3 percent this quarter  according to FactSet  If the forecasts prove accurate that would be highest earnings growth rate since the first quarter of 2011 Perhaps most surprising  is that analysts have grown more optimistic on corporate earnings as the quarter progressed  The earnings forecast for the index rose 5 4 percent from the start of the quarter to the end  Typically  analysts lower their expectations as the quarter progresses  On average  the profit estimates for the index fall 3 7 percent from the start of the quarter to the end But there are reasons for investors to temper their enthusiasm  Analysts have not been as optimistic about the abilities of companies to increase sales  Revenue is expected to have grown 7 3 percent in the first quarter  up from a 7 percent rate at the start of the quarter That suggests analysts are not raising estimates because of increased sales  So why are they  Taxes  And the impact tax reform will have on bottom lines should moderate in the coming quarters That may already be happening  BofA Merrill Lynch s earnings revision ratio for the S  P  500 fell in March for the first time in three months  Of course  the pullback comes after the ratio hits the highest level on record in February  but it does suggest that earnings lift from tax reform has begun to wane Investors  always willing to believe in technology companies  spent the last three years piling into their shares with abandon  Now the intellectual underpinnings of that rally are being tested Exhibit A  Facebook  down 20 percent from its recent high Exhibit B  Nvidia  off 12 percent from its recent high Exhibit C  Tesla  not a tech stock but in the FANG  index Concerns about Tesla s ability to fund itself can also be seen in the trading of its debt The WSJ s Charley Grant explains Peter Eavis notes that the latest problems for tech giants have raised deeper doubts Barclays said on Thursday that it agreed to pay  2 billion to settle a lawsuit by United States authorities that accused the British bank of fraudulently misleading the public in the sale of tens of billions of dollars in securities backed by home mortgages The Justice Department sued the bank in December 2016 after the two sides failed to reach a settlement despite months of talks  The settlement is the latest by a European lender related to residential mortgage backed securities sold ahead of the financial crisis and follows agreements reached by Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank in late 2016  I am pleased that we have been able to reach a fair and proportionate settlement with the Department of Justice   James E  Staley  the Barclays chief executive  said in a news release   It has been a priority for this management team from the start to resolve these historic issues in a timely and appropriate manner wherever possible  Two former Barclays executives who were sued along with the bank also have reached settlements  agreeing to pay a combined  2 million  the Justice Department said in a news release Their lawyers separately said the government s claims were baseless and each agreed to settle the case without admitting wrongdoing

BEVERLY HILLS  Calif    Barry Diller knows your weaknesses He knows how to intimidate you  if he wants to  or charm you  if he chooses  Because he is a taskmaster and a visionary and a billionaire  people in Hollywood and Silicon Valley pay close attention when he speaks He has so many vests from Herb Allen s Sun Valley retreats for global elites that they re taking over his closets  There is so much fleece   says the chairman of IAC  laughing   I ve been going for 30 years  On this rainy afternoon  by the fireplace in the Frank Lloyd Wright inspired stone and wood living room of his dreamy mansion  Mr  Diller is all charm  with a healthy dose of self deprecation  He s dressed in a red checked flannel shirt  a burgundy Hermès hoodie  baggy jeans and black Tod s loafers We are eating cold salads and drinking hot tea  served by the butler  Victor  And we are hopscotching topics  from Silicon Valley taking over Hollywood to Jared   Ivanka   Josh   Karlie to pornography to his company s dating websites to the time Harvey Weinstein tried to throw Mr  Diller off a balcony in Cannes to how his friend Hillary Clinton is faring to the mogul s dismissal of Donald Trump  whose Secret Service code name is Mogul  as  a joke  and  evil  I tell him that a friend of mine  an executive in network television  fretfully asked her Hollywood psychic how long Mr  Trump would last as president and the psychic asserted that it wouldn t be more than two years and that the president would be felled by a three page email   The only problem with this prediction being  I don t think Mr  Trump emails   I would so love it if he were being blackmailed by Putin   Mr  Diller says with a sly smile   That would make me very happy  This was a man of bad character from the moment he entered adulthood  if not before  Pure  bad character  Ugh  Trump  He shrugs off what he calls Trump s  normal  vicious Twitter attacks  on him  After Mr  Diller mocked Trump s campaign in 2015  Trump tweeted   Little Barry Diller  who lost a fortune on Newsweek and Daily Beast  only writes badly about me  He is a sad and pathetic figure  Lives lie  Mr  Diller waves off talk of Mr  Trump opening the door to more celebrity presidents  saying   I want this to be a moment in time where you go in and pick out this period with pincers and go on with life as we knew it before  Has the media gone overboard in criticizing Mr  Trump  Are you kidding   he replies Mr  Diller says that he and his wife  Diane von Furstenberg  are friends with Josh Kushner and his supermodel girlfriend  Karlie Kloss  but do not hang out with Jared and Ivanka He has put Chelsea Clinton on the boards of two of his companies  but that is not likely to happen with this first daughter  I mean  we were friendly   he says of Ivanka  in the time before Mr  Trump became president   I would sit next to her every once in a while at a dinner  And I  as everyone did  was like   Oh  my God  how could this evil character have spawned such a polite  gracious person   I don t think we feel that way now  At 76  having seen around the corner to tech and pulled together the ragtag group of internet ventures at IAC into a thriving whole  Mr  Diller has  mellowed beautifully   as one producer here who has known him for many years puts it His dogs are jumping up on our chairs  He has three Jack Russell terriers cloned from his late  beloved dog Shannon  a Gaelic orphan he found wandering many years ago on a back road in Ireland For about  100 000  a South Korean firm  reincarnated  Shannon in three pups  Tess  short for  test tube   and DiNA  a play on DNA  who live in Beverly Hills  and Evita  who lives in Cloudwalk  the Connecticut home of Mr  Diller and Ms  von Furstenberg  These dogs  they re the soul of Shannon   he says   Diane was horrified that I was doing this but she s switched now to say   Thank God you did   Mr  Diller has started a trend in Hollywood  inspiring his friend Barbra Streisand  desolate over the loss of her Coton de Tulear  Samantha  to clone her Doesn t he want to clone himself into a  Killer Diller   as his protégés  including Jeffrey Katzenberg  Michael Eisner and Uber s Dara Khosrowshahi  are known  God forbid   he says with a grimace I ask Mr  Diller what he thought of Sacha Baron Cohen s joke at David Geffen s recent birthday party at Jimmy Iovine s house in Los Angeles that Mr  Geffen  Mr  Diller and the other starry billionaires and millionaires there represented  the world s third largest economy   It is a funny joke   he says   It s close to true  Is it a cool club to be in  I wonder  or a back stabbing one  For me  it s stimulating   he says   Diane hates it  So I am both in it  because I like it  and ripped out of it  because Diane says   Too much money  too many rich people  let s go   I ve got a good personal boomerang process  He says he met Mr  Geffen  whom he considers  family   when the two were teenagers in the William Morris mailroom in Los Angeles  It s Christmastime and this scrawny person comes into the mailroom and he said   I m in the mailroom at William Morris in New York  I had a week off for the holiday so I wanted to come and work here   And I thought  Oh  my God  on your vacation   Because for me  vacation was Hawaii  We talk about how Hollywood has changed  and I ask how the  MeToo era will affect the content of movies   Red Sparrow  has some of the most violent and extreme sexual messiness that you could imagine   he says   O K   it was made a year and a half ago  Would it be made today in the same way  Probably so  So I don t think it affects content  I mean  if you take the effect of pornography on young people today  Pornography until recently was fairly staid  Today  online  pornography is so extreme and so varied  with such expressions of fetishism and other things that boys are seeing  The idea of normal sex and normal romance has to be adversely affected by that  Once  Hollywood taught us about desire and sex and romance  giving us a vocabulary for these experiences  But no more  I wonder what will happen as girls emboldened by the fall of male predators collide with boys indoctrinated by pornography  I see it in our companies  where the relationships between people are changing   Mr  Diller says   We recently had a formal complaint made by a woman who said that she was at a convention with her colleagues and she was asked to have a drink with her boss  Period  That was the complaint  And we said   Here s the thing  Anybody can ask you anything  other than let s presume something illegal  and you have the right to say  Yes  or  No   If it s  Yes   go in good health and if it s  No   then it s full stop   But the end result of that is a guy  let s presume he is heterosexual  and his boss  heterosexual  and guy asks guy for a drink and they go have a drink and they talk about career opportunities  And the boss says   Oh  this is a smart guy  I m promoting him   A woman now cannot be in that position  So all these things are a changin   God knows  I m hardly a sociologist  But I hope in the future for some form of reconciliation  Because I think all men are guilty  I m not talking about rape and pillage  I m not talking about Harveyesque  I m talking about all of the spectrum  From an aggressive flirt  Or even just a flirty flirt that has one sour note in it  Or what I think every man was guilty of  some form of omission in attitude  in his views  Are we really going to have only capital punishment  Because right now  that s what we have  You get accused  you re obliterated  Charlie Rose ceases to exist  Mr  Diller is the chairman of the board of Expedia  and his IAC owns a gaggle of internet properties  including Vimeo  Dictionary com  Investopedia  Tinder  Match and OkCupid  I wonder how he thinks online dating is reshaping the culture  It s just like the princess phone evolved to the internet   he says   Match com has caused God knows how many more marriages than bars ever did  And now I m starting to hear that out of Tinder  It s funny  though  on Bumble  the women get to choose first and they don t want to  I liked the sheer adventure of romance before online dating  which is less appealing to me  I ask Mr  Diller  a Los Angeles native  about a comment made to me by the playwright and TV writer Jon Robin Baitz  another Los Angeles native  that Hollywood is no longer relevant politically and culturally  Does Hollywood reflect in any possible sense what is happening in the world   Mr  Baitz asked   Hollywood abdicated films and became an empty exercise in male capes and superheroes  Can you imagine anyone now making  Norma Rae    Silkwood    Five Easy Pieces    Reds   Since Mr  Diller was running Paramount in 1981 when Warren Beatty and Diane Keaton made Mr  Beatty s epic  Reds   he should know  What an undertaking   Mr  Diller says   But isn t it amazing how it holds  Calling  Red Sparrow   awful  and  The Shape of Water   beautiful but silly   he says he wouldn t want to run a movie studio now   It would be like saying  do I want to own a horse and buggy company  The idea of a movie is losing its meaning  Of the Academy Awards nominees this year  he said   essentially  no one went to see them  Growing up in Beverly Hills with a father in the construction business   he says there are still streets out here named  Dillerdale  and  Barrydale    Mr  Diller was able to see the twilight of the men who invented Hollywood  They were real characters   overblown  exuberant  nasty  but each of them in their own way were genuinely interesting people   he says   The only thing that I ve learned  that I think I ve had some instinct for  is instinct  And these people operated completely out of instinct  As against today  when people operate out of research and marketing  He says that Netflix and Amazon have blasted Hollywood into  a completely different universe   It s something that s never happened in media before  when Netflix got a lot of subscribers early on and made the brilliant decision to pour it into original production  like spending more than  100 million dollars to make  House of Cards   instead of buying old stuff   he says   It blows my mind  It s like a giant vacuum cleaner came and pushed all the other vacuum cleaners aside  And they cannot be outbid  No one can compete with them  He calls Reed Hastings  the C E O  of Netflix  the most remarkable person in the media business   He has so much original thinking in so many different areas  he s really impressive  I ask how the tech community s noxious bro culture will affect the business here  given that Hollywood already has such entrenched sexism  They re tech people   he says with a shrug   They don t have a lot of romance in them  They don t have a lot of nuance in them  Their lives are ones and zeros   But they can grow  he says   When I met Bill Gates  I would say he had the emotional quotient of a snail  And now you can see him cry  He corrects me when I call the tech titans our overlords   Our overlords are not them   he says   Our overlords are artificial intelligence  At several points during our three hour interview  Mr  Diller stops to ask me if this is any fun  When I assure him it s fascinating  he looks skeptical  Yeah  right   he says   Don t seduce me  I m a very seducible person   He also says he s a  jinxable  person Ms  von Furstenberg says that when she met Mr  Diller 43 years ago   What I found so incredibly appealing is that behind the very forceful  determined and engaged human being  there was shyness and reservation  He s not a pig  I mean  in no way  He impressed her immediately on a trip to Vegas by driving his banana yellow Jaguar E Type sports car barefoot and talking a policeman out of giving him a speeding ticket On another occasion  driving back into Manhattan fast from her Connecticut house   Mr  Diller likes to drive fast   they saw an octogenarian couple crossing the street slowly  holding on to each other  Both of us at the same time thought exactly the same thing   One day  we will be that couple    she recalls   The only thing we disagree on is  he thinks it was Madison Avenue and I say it was Lexington  The other quality his friends talk about is his voracious curiosity  When he knows about something  he knows more about it than anyone else  and when he doesn t know something  he wants to know more about it than anybody else   says Scott Rudin  who has produced movies  plays and television with Mr  Diller  including  Lady Bird  for the screen and  Betrayal    The Humans    A Doll s House  Part 2    Three Tall Women  and  Carousel  for Broadway   Mr  Rudin is also helping his friend develop the so called Diller Island  an undulating pier floating on piles in the Hudson River adjacent to the meatpacking district Given that Mr  Diller helped create the Fox Broadcasting Company with Rupert Murdoch   and blessedly greenlighted  The Simpsons    I wonder if he feels like Dr  Frankenstein  I left Fox before Fox News came into being   he says  About the sale of Fox to Disney  he notes that his former boss  played a bad hand very well  I observe that he called Harvey Weinstein out publicly as a bully early on Mr  Diller recalls that once in Cannes  when he was the chief executive of Universal  Stacey Snider  the head of the movie division  told him that  Harvey had treated her terribly and made her cry  So the next day I saw Harvey on the terrace at Hotel du Cap and I said   Harvey  don t ever treat an executive at my company that way  Don t you ever talk to anyone in that manner   And Harvey  about six feet away  said   I m going to throw you off the terrace   And this gorilla  because he looks like a gorilla  starts walking towards me  right  And truly  I was scared  I thought  how  without cutting and running like a chicken  do I stop him  And somehow a bear came into my mind   He says he pulled himself up into a menacing stance  as you re supposed to do if you have to confront a bear  And it so surprised him that he stopped and I got out with a small amount of honor   he says  Ms  Snider told Kim Masters in a 2007 Esquire article that Mr  Diller was such a tough boss that she teared up with him  after she made a blunder at a meeting  Mr  Diller apologized to her afterward  He adds   Other than psychopaths  I think all of this bad behavior is finished  Speaking of bad behavior  I ask if he knew Mr  Trump back in the day in Manhattan He said that when he was in his mid 30s  running Paramount  Mr  Trump invited him to lunch  And you know when people compliment you without foundation   Mr  Diller says   And they do it too much  It s really irritating  It s kind of offensive  And he spent the entire time saying how great I was  He didn t know me  And afterward  I walked around the corner and I thought   I never want to see that man again   Decades passed and we would run into each other  but I literally never spoke to him again  He says he has gone to a couple of Broadway shows recently with Hillary Clinton and that  she s well with herself again and she has a role to play  After the interview  when the Cambridge Analytica scandal breaks  I call him to see what he makes of Facebook s role  Since the beginning of media and advertising  the holy grail has been the precise targeting of the ads   he says   Along comes the internet with almost perfect aim  and now the entire concept is being called antisocial  That s a most ironic but momentous thing  Mr  Diller s friends say he is quiet about his philanthropy  He flinches when I use the term  Diller Island   saying it should be called  Pier 55  Now he is working on an idea concocted by Alex von Furstenberg  Diane s son whom Mr  Diller also calls his son  to build a gondola up to the Hollywood sign and a circular catwalk around it  so that people can tour and hike around it He is very proud of the success of the High Line  the elevated park he helped fund on the West Side of Manhattan   Who would have dreamed so many people would come   he marvels Andrew M  Cuomo  the governor of New York  pulled the Hudson Island project  a  250 million family park and cultural center  out of the ashes  moving past attempts by Douglas Durst to block it   Hasn t that family done enough damage   The delay cost us  25 million or something like that   Mr  Diller says   But here s the thing  My family s lucky  So who s counting  Can I actually say   Who s counting   That s awful  But it s true  There s a lot about the absurdity of wealth  I have so many friends who continue to make absurd amounts of money and count it  I think if you re really lucky  who s counting  MORE  Barry Diller confesses a major fear in a round of Confirm or Deny 
WASHINGTON   Sitting in a hotel bar  Alexander Nix  who runs the political data firm Cambridge Analytica  had a few ideas for a prospective client looking for help in a foreign election  The firm could send an attractive woman to seduce a rival candidate and secretly videotape the encounter  Mr  Nix said  or send someone posing as a wealthy land developer to pass a bribe  We have a long history of working behind the scenes   Mr  Nix said The prospective client  though  was actually a reporter from Channel 4 News in Britain  and the encounter was secretly filmed as part of a monthslong investigation into Cambridge Analytica  the data firm with ties to President Trump s 2016 campaign The results of Channel 4 s work were broadcast in Britain on Monday  days after reports in The New York Times and The Observer of London that the firm had harvested the data from more than 50 million Facebook profiles in its bid to develop techniques for predicting the behavior of individual American voters The weekend s reports about the data misuse have prompted calls from lawmakers in Britain and the United States for renewed scrutiny of Facebook  and at least two American state prosecutors have said they are looking into the misuse of data by Cambridge Analytica Now  the Channel 4 broadcast appears likely to cast an even harsher spotlight on the company  which was founded by Stephen K  Bannon and Robert Mercer  a wealthy Republican donor who has put at least  15 million into Cambridge Analytica The firm s so called psychographic modeling techniques  which were built in part with the data harvested from Facebook  underpinned its work for the Trump campaign in 2016  though many have questioned their effectiveness Less noticed has been the work that Cambridge Analytica and its parent company  the SCL Group  have done outside the United States  The operations of the two companies were set up with a convoluted corporate structure and are deeply intertwined Mr  Nix  for instance  holds dual appointments at the two companies  Cambridge Analytica is registered in Delaware and almost wholly owned by the Mercer family  but it is effectively a shell   it holds intellectual property rights to its so called psychographic modeling tools  yet its clients are served by the staff at London based SCL and overseen by Mr  Nix  who is a British citizen SCL Elections has clients around the world  and it has experimented with data driven microtargeting techniques in the Caribbean and Africa  where privacy rules are lax or nonexistent and politicians employing SCL have been happy to provide government held data  according to former employees  ALSO READ  How Cambridge Analytica Harvested Facebook Data  Triggering a New Outcry But in the footage broadcast by Channel 4  Mr  Nix offered services that go far beyond data harvesting  The Times did not work with Channel 4 on its report about Cambridge Analytica  Many of our clients don t want to be seen to be working with a foreign company   he told the Channel 4 reporter  who was not identified   We can set up fake IDs and websites  we can be students doing research projects attached to a university  we can be tourists  There s so many options we can look at  The Channel 4 reporter posed as a  fixer  for a wealthy Sri Lankan family that wanted to help politicians they favored  In a series of meetings at London hotels between November and January  all of which were secretly filmed  Mr  Nix and other executives boasted that Cambridge Analytica employs front companies and former spies on behalf of political clients The information that is uncovered through such clandestine work is then put  into the bloodstream to the internet   said Mark Turnbull  another Cambridge executive  in an encounter in December 2017 at the Berkeley hotel in London  Then watch it grow  give it a little push every now and again  over time  to watch it take shape   he added   It has to happen without anyone thinking   That s propaganda   Because the moment you think  that s propaganda   the next question is   Who s put that out   The most damning footage  though  was of Mr  Nix s suggestion that the company could entrap political rivals through seduction or bribery At a meeting in January  also at the Berkeley hotel  Mr  Nix was direct about the techniques SCL could use to aid a client  I mean  deep digging is interesting   he said   But you know equally effective can be just to go and speak to the incumbents and to offer them a deal that s too good to be true  and make sure that that s video recorded  you know  These sorts of tactics are very effective  instantly having video evidence of corruption  putting it on the internet  these sorts of things  Mr  Nix then suggested they could have someone pose as a wealthy developer   They will offer a large amount of money to the candidate  to finance his campaign in exchange for land for instance   he said   We ll have the whole thing recorded on cameras  Or  Mr  Nix said  they could  send some girls around to the candidate s house   we have lots of history of things  The reporter asked what kind of girls  and Mr  Nix said they could find some Ukrainian women   I m just saying  we could bring some Ukrainians in on holiday with us you know   Mr  Nix replied   You know what I m saying   They are very beautiful   he said   I find that works very well  To be sure  though  Mr  Nix said that he was speaking only in hypotheticals   Please don t pay too much attention to what I m saying because I m just giving you examples of what can be done and what  what has been done   he said Cambridge Analytica  in a statement issued after the Channel 4 broadcast  said the report was  edited and scripted to grossly misrepresent the nature of those conversations and how the company conducts its business  The company said that it was the undercover reporter who had raised the idea of entrapping politicians  and that the executives had been trying to assess his intent  Mr  Nix and Mr  Turnbull  humored these questions and actively encouraged the prospective client to disclose his intentions   it said  They left with grave concerns and did not meet with him again   the company said For Mr  Nix  the footage comes at an already perilous moment  Earlier this month  he told a parliamentary inquiry into fake news and Russian interference in Britain s referendum to exit the European Union that Cambridge Analytica never used or possessed Facebook data But following the reports in The Times and Observer on Saturday  Damian Collins  the Conservative lawmaker leading the inquiry  said he planned to call Mr  Nix back to testify  It seems clear that he has deliberately misled the committee and Parliament   Mr  Collins said in a statement this weekend Elizabeth Denham  the British information commissioner  told Channel 4 News that on March 7 she asked for access to Cambridge Analytica  setting a deadline of 6 p m  Monday  Ms  Denham said she did not accept the response as satisfactory and so would be applying in court on Tuesday for a warrant  We need to look at the databases  we need to look at the servers and understand how the data was processed   she said In a statement  Facebook said that it had  hired a digital forensics firm  Stroz Friedberg  to conduct a comprehensive audit of Cambridge Analytica  But Mr  Collins  who is chairman of the House of Commons digital  culture  media and sport committee  said he was concerned that Facebook might gain access to data before the information commissioner did  What are they doing   Mr  Collins asked on Channel 4 News   Are they going in to physically recover data  to disturb the files  This investigation should be for the authorities  Mr  Collins said that the former Cambridge Analytica employee who came forward to disclose his company s actions  Christopher Wylie  would be giving evidence to his committee  He said he wanted Mark Zuckerberg  or another senior executive from Facebook  to do the same 
As a start up called Cambridge Analytica sought to harvest the Facebook data of tens of millions of Americans in summer 2014  the company received help from at least one employee at Palantir Technologies  a top Silicon Valley contractor to American spy agencies and the Pentagon It was a Palantir employee in London  working closely with the data scientists building Cambridge s psychological profiling technology  who suggested the scientists create their own app   a mobile phone based personality quiz   to gain access to Facebook users  friend networks  according to documents obtained by The New York Times Cambridge ultimately took a similar approach  By early summer  the company found a university researcher to harvest data using a personality questionnaire and Facebook app  The researcher scraped private data from over 50 million Facebook users   and Cambridge Analytica went into business selling so called psychometric profiles of American voters  setting itself on a collision course with regulators and lawmakers in the United States and Britain  Read more about the Cambridge Analytica whistle blower contending that data mining swung the Brexit referendum  The revelations pulled Palantir   co founded by the wealthy libertarian Peter Thiel   into the furor surrounding Cambridge  which improperly obtained Facebook data to build analytical tools it deployed on behalf of Donald J  Trump and other Republican candidates in 2016  Mr  Thiel  a supporter of President Trump  serves on the board at Facebook  There were senior Palantir employees that were also working on the Facebook data   said Christopher Wylie  a data expert and Cambridge Analytica co founder  in testimony before British lawmakers on Tuesday Cambridge Analytica has found itself confronting a deepening crisis since reports about the firm s data harvesting were published this month in The New York Times  The Observer of London and The Guardian The connections between Palantir and Cambridge Analytica were thrust into the spotlight by Mr  Wylie s testimony on Tuesday  Both companies are linked to tech driven billionaires who backed Mr  Trump s campaign  Cambridge is chiefly owned by Robert Mercer  the computer scientist and hedge fund magnate  while Palantir was co founded in 2003 by Mr  Thiel  who was an initial investor in Facebook The Palantir employee  Alfredas Chmieliauskas  works on business development for the company  according to his LinkedIn page  In an initial statement  Palantir said it had  never had a relationship with Cambridge Analytica  nor have we ever worked on any Cambridge Analytica data   Later on Tuesday  Palantir revised its account  saying that Mr  Chmieliauskas was not acting on the company s behalf when he advised Mr  Wylie on the Facebook data  We learned today that an employee  in 2013 2014  engaged in an entirely personal capacity with people associated with Cambridge Analytica   the company said   We are looking into this and will take the appropriate action  The company said it was continuing to investigate but knew of no other employees who took part in the effort  Mr  Wylie told lawmakers that multiple Palantir employees played a role Documents and interviews indicate that starting in 2013  Mr  Chmieliauskas began corresponding with Mr  Wylie and a colleague from his Gmail account  At the time  Mr  Wylie and the colleague worked for the British defense and intelligence contractor SCL Group  which formed Cambridge Analytica with Mr  Mercer the next year  The three shared Google documents to brainstorm ideas about using big data to create sophisticated behavioral profiles  a product code named  Big Daddy  A former intern at SCL   Sophie Schmidt  the daughter of Eric Schmidt  then Google s executive chairman   urged the company to link up with Palantir  according to Mr  Wylie s testimony and a June 2013 email viewed by The Times  Ever come across Palantir  Amusingly Eric Schmidt s daughter was an intern with us and is trying to push us towards them   one SCL employee wrote to a colleague in the email Ms  Schmidt did not respond to requests for comment  nor did a spokesman for Cambridge Analytica In early 2013  Alexander Nix  an SCL director who became chief executive of Cambridge Analytica  and a Palantir executive discussed working together on election campaigns A Palantir spokeswoman acknowledged that the companies had briefly considered working together but said that Palantir declined a partnership  in part because executives there wanted to steer clear of election work  Emails reviewed by The Times indicate that Mr  Nix and Mr  Chmieliauskas sought to revive talks about a formal partnership through early 2014  but Palantir executives again declined In his testimony  Mr  Wylie acknowledged that Palantir and Cambridge Analytica never signed a contract or entered into a formal business relationship  But he said some Palantir employees helped engineer Cambridge s psychographic models  There were Palantir staff who would come into the office and work on the data   Mr  Wylie told lawmakers   And we would go and meet with Palantir staff at Palantir   He did not provide an exact number for the employees or identify them Palantir employees were impressed with Cambridge s backing from Mr  Mercer  one of the world s richest men  according to messages viewed by The Times  And Cambridge Analytica viewed Palantir s Silicon Valley ties as a valuable resource for launching and expanding its own business In an interview this month with The Times  Mr  Wylie said that Palantir employees were eager to learn more about using Facebook data and psychographics  Those discussions continued through spring 2014  according to Mr  Wylie Mr  Wylie said that he and Mr  Nix visited Palantir s London office on Soho Square  One side was set up like a high security office  Mr  Wylie said  with separate rooms that could be entered only with particular codes  The other side  he said  was like a tech start up    weird inspirational quotes and stuff on the wall and free beer  and there s a Ping Pong table  Mr  Chmieliauskas continued to communicate with Mr  Wylie s team in 2014  as the Cambridge employees were locked in protracted negotiations with a researcher at Cambridge University  Michal Kosinski  to obtain Facebook data through an app Mr  Kosinski had built  The data was crucial to efficiently scale up Cambridge s psychometrics products so they could be used in elections and for corporate clients  I had left field idea   Mr  Chmieliauskas wrote in May 2014   What about replicating the work of the cambridge prof as a mobile app that connects to facebook   Reproducing the app  Mr  Chmieliauskas wrote   could be a valuable leverage negotiating with the guy  Those negotiations failed  But Mr  Wylie struck gold with another Cambridge researcher  the Russian American psychologist Aleksandr Kogan  who built his own personality quiz app for Facebook  Over subsequent months  Dr  Kogan s work helped Cambridge develop psychological profiles of millions of American voters 
ABUJA    Nigeria s government will investigate allegations of improper involvement by political consultancy Cambridge Analytica in the country s 2007 and 2015 elections  a presidency spokesman said on Monday The UK based political consultancy is facing allegations that it improperly accessed data from social media website Facebook to target voters prior to the U S  presidential election and Britain s Brexit referendum in 2016 In Nigeria  a government committee is looking into claims that SCL Elections  a Cambridge Analytica affiliate  organised anti election rallies to dissuade opposition supporters from voting in 2007  Garba Shehu  a spokesman for President Muhammadu Buhari  said He said it would examine claims that Buhari s personal data was hacked in 2015 when he was an opposition candidate in the presidential election The investigation would also look into whether Cambridge Analytica s work for the election campaigns of the then ruling Peoples Democratic Party  PDP  broke Nigerian law  or infringed on the rights of other parties and their candidates  Depending on the outcome  criminal prosecutions might result  said Shehu Cambridge Analytica could not immediately be reached for comment PDP candidate Umaru Yar Adua won the 2007 presidential ballot  He died in office in 2010 and was succeeded by his deputy  Goodluck Jonathan  Additional reporting by Paul Sandle in London  Writing by Alexis Akwagyiram  editing by John Stonestreet 
If there was one broad takeaway from the data leak involving Cambridge Analytica  the voter profiling firm that obtained private information from up to 87 million Facebook accounts  it s that you should hesitate before sharing your data with an unknown brand This lesson applies to just about everything that touches your personal technology  including the apps that you download to your phone or computer and the free online services that you use  And  yes  it also includes those seemingly harmless personality tests run by some unfamiliar organization on Facebook   the kind that helped Cambridge Analytica get the data on users To make matters worse  the information that can be stolen from you is becoming increasingly personal  Smartphones  for one  are embedded with microphones  motion sensors and cameras that can spy on your every move if corrupted by a bad actor  Home gadgets like internet connected thermostats  power outlets and audio speakers are capable of collecting information about what you are doing at home  including listening to your conversations  and knowing when you are away from home It s time to stop using technology and the internet as though you were shopping at a supermarket  In a grocery store  you can reasonably assume that the food labels are accurate and the products safe to eat  because the food industry is heavily regulated  The handling of personal digital information  in contrast  is  loosely regulated  There have been scores of obscure companies baiting you with products that purport to improve your life   but actually capitalize on your data  We don t really know why we re trusting that a particular company with access to our data won t do something like sell it or rent it or share it without our consent   said Lee Tien  a lawyer for the Electronic Frontier Foundation  a nonprofit that focuses on digital rights That s not to say the tech behemoths are innocent  The data leak to Cambridge Analytica was ultimately Facebook s fault because its app platform allowed data to be harvested from people s friends lists in the first place  About five years ago  Google had to pay a  7 million fine after acknowledging that it had scooped up passwords  email and other personal data with its Street View mapping project Yet I am recommending taking extra caution with obscure tech brands because it is something under your control  You can take a pause  Don t immediately download every app you see in an app store or on the web just because it looks fun  Don t take every quiz you see on Facebook  even if you are dying to know which  Game of Thrones  character identifies with you   Don t impulse buy internet connected devices from unfamiliar brands  Don t do any of this without first doing some research on the reputations of these vendors and their business models Here are some examples of when unknown brands did us wrong   and the lessons we can learn Last year  The New York Times revealed that Uber bought information about Lyft  its main ride hailing competitor in the United States  from Unroll me  a free email service that offered to unsubscribe people from marketing emails How did Unroll me get data about Lyft  Unroll me scanned users  inboxes for information and sold it to other businesses  and Uber paid it for data it found about Lyft receipts  Many consumers found it misleading that a company that promised to rid you of spam from marketers made money by selling your information to marketers and other companies Here s the kicker  The truth was always laid out in the privacy policy  which said that  we may collect  use  transfer  sell and disclose nonpersonal information for any purpose  and that data could be used  to build anonymous market research products and services  In response to the backlash  Unroll me said it was  heartbreaking  to see that people were upset and pledged to be more transparent about its use of data  The app continues to operate The lessons  Whenever you have the time  read privacy policies before opting to share your data with a brand  This is a daunting task but a healthy exercise  especially when you are unfamiliar and feeling distrustful toward an obscure company  And do the best you can to research a company s business model  When a service or product is free  assume that your personal information is being monetized  We all need to know that whenever you re not paying for the thing  then you re paying for the thing in a nonmonetary way   Mr  Tien said Last year  an app called Soniac was available for Android phones on the Google Play app store  Soniac marketed itself as a messaging app   and indeed  it included features for sending text messages  The less obvious features  The app was also capable of silently recording audio  taking photos with the camera  placing phone calls and downloading call logs among other features Lookout  a security firm that follows malicious software for Android devices  alerted Google about Soniac s hidden abilities last year  and the app was quickly removed from the Play app store Yet Lookout said its researchers had identified over 1 000 spyware apps with many of the same characteristics that Soniac had  Many of those spyware apps were served in third party app stores that are not authorized by Google The company that offered Soniac  Iraqwebservice  had published other spyware apps on the Play store  All of its apps have been removed from Play  but Lookout warned that the spyware would probably resurface in the future The lessons  For one  before you install an app from a company you ve never heard of  look at its user reviews and do a web search on the company to see if its services are legitimate  You can also check reputable web publications that review apps  like TouchArcade  CNET and Tom s Guide For another  when installing an app  take a close look at what data it is accessing  Smartphone apps will ask for permission for access to certain data and sensors  If an app is asking for data that is unrelated to the product  don t install it  For example  you can reasonably expect a mapping app to ask for your location data  but it shouldn t need access to your camera  If something seems outside of the scope  like if a calculator app tells you it needs to use your webcam  say   What  why    said Adam Kujawa  the head of malware intelligence at Malwarebytes  a security firm Third  avoid downloading apps from unofficial app stores and sites that are not affiliated with large brands  And keep in mind that alternative app stores are particularly ripe for malware  because just about anything can be distributed there  similar to a flea market Parents  beware  A number of internet products have specifically collected data about children  EchoMetrix is a notorious example  In 2009  the company issued a news release bragging that it had predicted the winner of that year s  American Idol  singing competition How did it do that  By looking at children s private information  The company started in 2004 with the name SearchHelp  offering a parental control app called FamilySafe for parents to monitor their children s online activities  Five years later  it rebranded itself as EchoMetrix and released Pulse  a tool for providing insight to third party marketers on youths  by aggregating data from millions of teenagers  chat transcripts and blog posts  among other sources EchoMetrix s practices attracted the attention of the Electronic Privacy Information Center  a privacy rights group  which filed a complaint about the company to the Federal Trade Commission  The group accused EchoMetrix of violating the Children s Online Privacy Protection Act by collecting information on minors without parental consent  In 2010  EchoMetrix reached settlements with the commission and the New York attorney general s office in which it agreed not to analyze or share information about children s private communications or online activities  EchoMetrix has since rebranded itself as Protext Mobility  a biotech company The lessons  Be judicious when choosing tech products for your children  Increasingly  toys are beginning to include internet connections   before buying a  smart  toy  do your homework on what the companies are doing with the data  Common Sense Media  a nonprofit that evaluates content and products for families  is a good place to start your research Perhaps the most important lesson is to acknowledge that you don t know anything about the vast majority of brands you engage with on the internet  So tread carefully  These threats aren t going away   Mr  Tien said   With the expansion of data collection and the expansion of what s possible to collect  it s just going to continue to proliferate  
 One of our biggest responsibilities is to protect data  That s what Mark Zuckerberg  Facebook s chief executive and co founder  said just over a week ago after revelations that the data research firm Cambridge Analytica had gained access to the profiles of 50 million Facebook users Over the past year  the downside of social media companies   Facebook foremost among them   has become glaringly apparent  They have been platforms for information campaigns that influenced elections and endangered lives  They have failed to keep users  personal information private  And the carefully targeted ads that appear on them can be  well  creepy Now the drumbeat for regulation of social media on both sides of the aisle   and from many in Silicon Valley   is getting louder by the day   I think that this certain situation is so dire and has become so large that probably some well crafted regulation is necessary   Tim Cook  Apple s chief executive  said recently Mr  Zuckerberg may be getting tired of other executives sniping at his company  but he needs to come up with a solution   fast  For several weeks  I ve been canvassing various technology executives  privacy advocates  academics and others to come up with some ideas about exactly what Facebook could do to fix itself It is not clear that Facebook will be able to stave off regulators  but Mr  Zuckerberg and his colleagues might want to consider this  a  Why Me   button   Google  Amazon and others might want to take note  too  Facebook suffers from a lack of trust because of the asymmetrical nature of the relationship users have with it  We provide it all sorts of information  But we have no idea how the information is being used  how our data is being harvested  how that data is being commingled and cross referenced with other data sets and ultimately sold to advertisers   Facebook already has a button  relatively buried in a list of other items  that it calls  Why Am I Seeing This Ad   It is  to some degree  a crippled version of what I m suggesting should be introduced on all of Facebook s properties  To his credit  Mr  Zuckerberg does appear to recognize the problem that his company faces over privacy concerns  After acknowledging that protecting users  data is one of the company s biggest responsibilities  he went on to say   If you think about what our services are  at their most basic level  you put some content into a service  whether it s a photo or a video or a text message   whether it s Facebook or WhatsApp or Instagram   and you re trusting that that content is going to be shared with the people you want to share it with  But the solution Facebook offered last week   putting all of your privacy settings on one screen and blocking some third parties from access to data   is just a Band Aid  It s a start  but it doesn t provide a road map for how your information is being used That s where the  Why Me   button could help  This button would sit next to every advertisement and piece of content that appears before you on all of Facebook s properties  including Instagram and WhatsApp If you saw an ad or an article pop up on your screen  you could click the  Why Me   button  Then you would see a full explanation of why that item was pushed to you The  Why Me   explanation would not just include the name of the advertiser  but what keywords  demographics or other information the advertiser specifically targeted  It would also offer a full rundown of how your information fit into the parameters of the advertiser s request and where that information came from Maybe Facebook saw that you had clicked on a pair of sneakers on a different service that shares information with Facebook  The  Why Me   section would show you when and where that information was collected  Did Facebook notice you searched for a new cellphone plan  Facebook would tell how it knew that  too Did Facebook use artificial intelligence to find your face in an image without you or anyone else labeling it  The  Why Me   section would show you the images that the artificial intelligence system cross referenced to identify you  Did Facebook scrape another site or buy information about you that it commingled with the data that you had provided  It would tell you that  too Most important  at every point in the  explanation tree   the user would have the option to turn off or disable that specific piece of data  Facebook  of course  could   and probably should   explain the trade offs of such decisions The  Why Me   button could also be extended to content  When a friend or company shares a post  Facebook doesn t just display it to everyone listed as the poster s friend or follower  Facebook s algorithms choose which friends and followers see it based on all sorts of parameters  usually related to the kind of content or how you ve interacted with the friend in the past The  Why Me   button should explain all the data points that are used in the calculation and how they are weighted The current  Why Am I Seeing This Ad   often says something like   Company A wants to reach people ages 18 and older who live or were recently in the United States  This is information based on your Facebook profile and where you ve connected to the internet  But it hardly tells you the whole story  Facebook doesn t say so explicitly  but it allows companies to upload their own databases  cross reference them with Facebook s data and use that information to serve ads to users  It also doesn t say how that other site originally got that information about who you are In fairness  the  Why Me   button might create all sorts of problems for Facebook  and its advertisers  too  It would allow users   and rivals   to reverse engineer much of the way the system works  And advertisers would probably object to the idea of making their targeting plans public  But that would be the cost of using such large public platforms with such exact targeting It has become something of a cliché  but in 1913  before he became a Supreme Court justice  Louis D  Brandeis said   Sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants  It could well be applied today at Facebook   and its peer companies   if it wants to avoid a governmental crackdown 
WASHINGTON    Facebook Inc Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg will testify next week before congressional committees over a political consulting firm s misuse of customer data to interfere in the U S  presidential election  U S  lawmakers said on Wednesday     Zuckerberg will appear before a joint hearing of the U S  Senate Judiciary and Commerce committees on April 10 and the U S  House Energy and Commerce Committee on April 11  the panels said on Wednesday  This hearing will be an important opportunity to shed light on critical consumer data privacy issues and help all Americans better understand what happens to their personal information online   the House panel s Republican chairman  Greg Walden  and top Democrat  Frank Pallone  said in a statement Facebook has come under fire in recent weeks after it was disclosed that political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica  which worked for Donald Trump s presidential campaign  gained access to the personal data of 50 million Facebook users Facebook said in March it had suspended the accounts of Cambridge Analytica and its parent company and hired forensic auditors to probe whether Cambridge Analytica still had the data The technology company also said at the time it would investigate all applications that had gotten access to large amounts of data before the firm changed its platform in 2014  would further restrict developers  data access and roll out a tool to let users more easily revoke access by applications to their data Zuckerberg said in March he would testify before Congress  but turned down an invitation by British lawmakers to explain to a parliamentary committee what had happened The company has faced pressure to do more  both in terms of protecting user privacy and stopping  information warfare  on its platform In February  13 Russian nationals were indicted for using Facebook and other social media sites to interfere in the U S  presidential election On Tuesday  Facebook said it had removed hundreds of accounts and pages associated with the Russia based Internet Research Agency that included fake activist and political posts in the 2016 U S  election campaign American spy agencies have warned that Russia would try to interfere in the 2018 congressional elections by using social media to spread propaganda Shares in Facebook closed down 0 6 percent on Wednesday to  155 10  They have tumbled more than 16 percent since the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke  Reporting by Makini Brice  Additional reporting by Eric Beech  Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe and Peter Cooney

social media s effect on people s mental well being    4 20 p m Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is admitting to mistakes and says his company hasn t taken a broad enough view of what its responsibility is in the world In a call with media on Wednesday  Zuckerberg calls this a  huge mistake  and added   it s my mistake  Referring to the Cambridge Analytica privacy scandal  he said that it isn t enough for Facebook to believe app developers when they say they follow the rules  He says Facebook has to ensure they do Earlier in the day  Facebook revealed that as many as 87 million people might

changes  Facebook is restricting access that apps can get about users  events  as well as information about groups such as member lists and content In addition  the company is also removing the option to search for users by entering a phone number or an email address  While this helped individuals find friends who may have a common name  Facebook says businesses that had phone or email information

  are as important as what you say Other advice for the Facebook CEO  Appear sympathetic and be ready for a beating  Take responsibility  Don t feign ignorance The stakes are high for Zuckerberg s April 11 appearance before the House Energy and Commerce Committee    NoonFacebook s new privacy policy aims to explain the data it gathers on users more clearly   but doesn t actually change what it collects and shares The company unveiled the revisions Wednesday as it faces one of its worst privacy scandals in history  Although Facebook says the changes aren t prompted by recent events  it s an opportune time  CEO Mark Zuckerberg is also set to testify before Congress next week for the first time Among Wednesday s changes  Facebook has added a section explaining that it collects people s contact information  which may include call logs and text histories  The previous policy did not mention call logs or text histories  Several users were surprised to learn recently that Facebook had been collecting such data    8 30 a m The leaders of a House oversight committee say Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg will testify before the panel on April 11 In an announcement Wednesday  Reps  Greg Walden and Frank Pallone say the hearing will focus on the Facebook s  use and protection of user data   Facebook is facing scrutiny over its data collection following allegations that the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica obtained data on tens of millions of Facebook users to try to influence elections Walden  R Ore   is the House Energy and Commerce committee s chairman  Pallone of New Jersey is the panel s top ranking Democrat  They say the hearing will be  an important opportunity to shed light on critical consumer data privacy issues and help all Americans better understand what happens to their personal information online  
WASHINGTON    The leading U S  consumer protection regulator and attorneys representing 37 states stepped up pressure on Facebook Inc on Monday to explain how the social network allowed data of 50 million users get into the hands of a political consultancy The U S  Federal Trade Commission took the unusual step of announcing that it had opened an investigation into the company   which it generally only does in cases of great public interest   citing media reports that raise what it called  substantial concerns about the privacy practices of Facebook  On the same day  a bipartisan coalition of 37 state attorneys wrote to Facebook  demanding to know more about the company s role in the manipulation of users  data by the consultancy  Cambridge Analytica  which used it to target U S  and British voters in close run elections  These revelations raise many serious questions concerning Facebook s policies and practices  and the processes in place to ensure they are followed   the letter said   We need to know that users can trust Facebook  With the information we have now  our trust has been broken  Facebook shares fell as much as 6 5 percent  briefly dipping below  150 for the first time since July 2017  before recovering the day s losses to close up 0 4 percent at  160 06 The shares are still down 13 percent since March 16  when Facebook first acknowledged that user data had been improperly channelled to Cambridge Analytica  The company has lost more than  70 billion   49 1 billion  in market value since then The recovery in Facebook s stock on Monday may have been due to investors taking advantage of the lower stock price and the belief that the latest regulatory scrutiny may not ultimately hurt the company s relative long term growth prospects  Wall Street analysts said The FTC investigation is looking at more than whether Facebook violated a 2011 consent order it reached with the FTC over its privacy practices  a person briefed on the matter told Reuters If the FTC finds Facebook violated terms of the consent decree  it has the power to fine it thousands of dollars a day per violation  which could add up to billions of dollars  We remain strongly committed to protecting people s information   Facebook Deputy Chief Privacy Officer Rob Sherman said in a statement on Monday   We appreciate the opportunity to answer questions the FTC may have  ALL APOLOGIESLawmakers in the United States and Europe continue to pressure Facebook and Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg to explain the company s privacy practices The U S  Senate Judiciary Committee said on Monday it had invited Zuckerberg and the CEOs of Alphabet Inc and Twitter Inc to testify at an April 10 hearing on data privacy The U S  House Energy and Commerce Committee and U S  Senate Commerce Committee have already formally asked Zuckerberg to appear at a congressional hearing  Facebook s failure to protect confidential user information likely violated specific legally binding commitments  but also basic norms and standards   said U S  Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal  a member of the Senate Commerce  Science  and Transportation Committee In Europe  the European Union Justice Commissioner asked  Facebook if the company is  absolutely certain  that the Cambridge Analytica incident could not be repeated Zuckerberg apologised last week for the mistakes the company had made and he promised to restrict developers  access to user information as part of a plan to protect privacy  He also said sorry in full page advertisements in British and U S  newspapers  The was a breach of trust  and I m sorry we didn t do more at the time   Zuckerberg said in the ads   We are now taking steps to make sure this doesn t happen again   FUTURE REGULATION His

NEW YORK    Facebook revealed Wednesday that tens of millions more people might have been exposed in the Cambridge Analytica privacy scandal than previously thought and said it will restrict the user data that outsiders can access Those developments came as congressional officials said CEO Mark Zuckerberg will testify next week  while Facebook unveiled a new privacy policy that aims to explain the data it gathers on users more clearly   but doesn t actually change what it collects and shares In a call with reporters Wednesday  Zuckerberg acknowledged he made a  huge mistake  in failing to take a broad enough view of what Facebook s responsibility is in the world  He said it isn t enough for Facebook to believe app developers when they say they follow the rules  He says Facebook has to ensure they do Facebook is facing its worst privacy scandal in years following allegations that Cambridge Analytica  a Trump affiliated data mining firm  used ill gotten data from millions of users through an app to try to influence elections Facebook said Wednesday that as many as 87 million people might have had their data accessed   an increase from the 50 million disclosed in published reports  Facebook is basing the estimate in part on the number of friends each user might have had  Cambridge Analytica said in a statement that it had data for only 30 million people On Monday all Facebook users will receive a notice on their Facebook feeds with a link to see what apps they use and what information they have shared with those apps  They ll have a chance to delete apps they no longer want  Users who might have had their data shared with Cambridge Analytica will be told of that  Facebook says most of the affected users are in the U S Zuckerberg said fixing the company s problems will take years Besides the privacy scandal  Facebook also has been dealing with fake news  the use of Facebook to spread hate and discord and concerns about social media s effect on people s mental well being These are  big issues  and a big shift for Facebook as it broadens its responsibility  Zuckerberg said  He added that he does think that by the end of this year the company will have  turned a corner  on a lot of the issues  Zuckerberg has made fixing the company his personal challenge for 2018 As part of the steps it s taking to address scrutiny about outsiders  access to user data  Facebook outlined several changes to further tighten its policies  For one  it is restricting access that apps can have to data about users  events  as well as information about groups such as member lists and content In addition  the company is also removing the option to search for users by entering a phone number or an email address  While this helped individuals find friends  Facebook says businesses that had phone or email information on customers were able to collect profile information this way  Facebook says it believes most of its 2 2 billion users had their public profile information scraped by businesses or various malicious actors through this technique at some point  Posts and other content set to be visible only to friends weren t collected This comes on top of changes announced a few weeks ago  For example  Facebook has said it will remove developers  access to people s data if the person has not used the app in three months Earlier Wednesday  Facebook unveiled a new privacy policy that seeks to clarify its data collection and use Although Facebook says the policy changes aren t prompted by recent events or tighter privacy rules coming from the EU  it s an opportune time  Zuckerberg is set to testify April 10 before a joint hearing of the Senate Commerce and Judiciary Committees  and a day later before the House Energy and Commerce Committee   The two sessions will be his first testimony before Congress  Separately  the U S  Federal Trade Commission and various authorities in Europe are investigating As Facebook evolved from a closed  Harvard only network with no ads to a giant corporation with  40 billion in advertising revenue and huge subsidiaries like Instagram and WhatsApp  its privacy policy has also shifted   over and over Almost always  critics say  the changes meant a move away from protecting user privacy toward pushing openness and more sharing  On the other hand  regulatory and user pressure has sometimes led Facebook to pull back on its data collection and use and to explain things in plainer language   in contrast to dense legalese from many other internet companies The policy changes come a week after Facebook gave its privacy settings a makeover  The company tried to make it easier to navigate its complex and often confusing privacy and security settings  though the makeover didn t change what Facebook collects and shares either Facebook s new privacy policy has a new section explaining that it collects people s contact information if they choose to  upload  sync or import  this to the service  This may include users  address books on their phones  as well as their call logs and text histories  The new policy says Facebook may use this data to help  you and others find people you may know  Several users were surprised to learn recently that Facebook had been collecting information about whom they texted or called and for how long  though not the actual contents of text messages  It seemed to have been done without explicit consent  though Facebook says it collected such data only from Android users who specifically allowed it to do so   for instance  by agreeing to permissions when installing Facebook On Wednesday  Facebook said will delete all logs after a year and in the future  the only information this tool will collect from now on is the data that it needs to operate and  not broader data such as the time of calls  The new policy also makes it clear that WhatsApp and Instagram are part of Facebook and that the companies share information about users  WhatsApp will still have a separate policy as well  while Facebook and Instagram share one    This story has been corrected to reflect that WhatsApp has its own privacy policy  while Facebook and Instagram share the same one 
WASHINGTON    Facebook isn t just a company  It s a behemoth  with 2 1 billion monthly users   40 billion in revenue and more than 25 000 employees worldwide And that leaves Washington with a daunting task  How do you tame a corporate giant  Or do you even try  It s tricky and it s going to be hard  but there are ways it can be dealt with   says Virginia Sen  Mark Warner  a former tech executive who has led investigations into Russian interference on social media over the last year as the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee   The idea that we re going to keep the wild  wild West   I don t think it s sustainable  The picture will begin to come into focus next week  Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is scheduled to testify April 10 and 11 before Senate and House committees as his company grapples with the privacy scandal involving Cambridge Analytica  a political consulting firm linked to President Donald Trump Facebook s reckoning in Washington comes on multiple fronts  Russia s use of the platform to meddle in U S  elections  a regulatory investigation that could result in fines of hundreds of millions of dollars against the company for privacy violations  and the Cambridge Analytica episode are all topmost concerns But in the capital s pro business  anti regulatory climate  it s questionable whether the Republican led Congress or Trump regulators have the appetite to rein it in Facebook is spending millions on lobbying to try to ward off regulations  even seeking to narrow a Senate bill that lawmakers call  the lightest touch possible   It would require more transparency in online political ads  something Facebook says it is providing on its own But the stakes grew Wednesday when Facebook revealed that information belonging to as many as 87 million of its users may have been improperly shared with Cambridge Analytica  which gathered the data with the intent of swaying elections  That number was far higher than originally known Congress  response to the myriad issues dogging Facebook could depend on Zuckerberg himself  He has apologized for a  major breach of trust  in the Cambridge Analytica episode and Facebook has announced it would stop working with third party data collectors Privacy advocates and legal experts say that s not enough  It strikes me as a company that is trying to weather a PR storm and then get back to business as usual and hoping their users forget this ever happened   said Nate Cardozo  a senior staff attorney for Electronic Frontier Foundation  a privacy group based in San Francisco Facebook and other social media companies have faced bipartisan criticism over both privacy issues and the Russian intervention  But Trump and his pro business GOP allies on Capitol Hill have made rolling back Obama era regulations a priority  which makes any new federal rules for protecting data and privacy unlikely in the immediate future Republicans last year struck down online privacy regulations issued during President Barack Obama s final months in office that would have given consumers more control over how companies like Comcast  AT T and Verizon share information  Critics complained that the rule would have increased costs  stifled innovation and picked winners and losers among internet companies And Congress elected to do nothing after Equifax disclosed in September that hackers exploited a software flaw that the credit monitoring company failed to fix  exposing Social Security numbers  birthdates and other personal data belonging to nearly 148 million Americans Lawmakers have yet to come up with a fix for the patchwork of conflicting state laws that govern how companies shield personal data and notify consumers when breaches occur  Mike Litt  consumer campaign director at U S  PIRG  a public interest group  said Congress instead is considering legislation that would exempt credit bureaus from data break notifications and make it harder for states to hold them accountable  After the Equifax data breach  we saw Congress talk a good game but fail to follow through on helping consumers   Litt said   To prevent Congress from letting Facebook off the hook  outraged Americans need to keep up the heat  To defend its interests in Washington  Facebook has filled its executive ranks with former senior government officials from both political parties  Nathaniel Gleicher  its director of cybersecurity policy  was in charge of cybersecurity policy at the National Security Council during the Obama administration  Joel Kaplan  Facebook s vice president for global public policy  served as a senior aide to President George W  Bush The company spent just over  13 million on lobbying in 2017  according to disclosure records filed with Congress  One of the lobbying team s newer members  Sandra Luff  was Attorney General Jeff Sessions  national security adviser when he served in the Senate Zuckerberg suggested during a CNN interview last month that he s open to regulation  But he quickly qualified that commitment  saying he d get behind the  right  kind of rules  such as the bill that requires online political ads to disclose who paid for them  But the company is seeking to weaken even that bill Warner acknowledged that even minor regulation of Facebook and other technology companies will be difficult  But he s encouraging them to work with Washington now  before a  catastrophic event  that could shift the landscape or if Democrats win back seats in November s elections He suggests several possibilities  requiring Facebook and other companies to disclose the country of origin of ads  creating a self regulatory body  or even allowing users to move their data from one platform to another More drastic measures could be to allow users to own their own data or to hold social media companies more responsible for what is posted on their platforms In Europe  Facebook and other tech giants like Google are bracing for tough new data privacy rules that take effect May 25 and will apply to any company that collects data on EU residents  no matter where it is based  The rules will make it easier for consumers to give and withdraw consent for the use of their data In the U S   Facebook s biggest challenge may come from the Federal Trade Commission  which is investigating whether the company violated the terms of a 2011 settlement that made privacy assurances Facebook agreed then to settle the commission s charges that it deceived users by assuring them their information would remain private  then repeatedly allowing it to be shared and made public  Each violation of the agreement could carry a penalty of up to  40 000  according to settlement terms  meaning potential fines in the hundreds of millions Frank Pasquale  a University of Maryland law professor who s written extensively about how corporations use personal data  said the federal government s antitrust enforcers should be more vigilant with Facebook Facebook has completed dozens of mergers and acquisitions since it was founded in 2004  Pasquale said the Obama administration failed to realize the significance of two of Facebook s largest purchases  the photo sharing app Instagram for  1 billion in 2012 and WhatsApp two years later for nearly  22 billion  This is clearly a monopolistic company that is trying to eliminate even the smallest challenge to its domination of the social media market   he said The privacy scandal has taken a heavy financial toll on Zuckerberg and Facebook  Forbes Magazine estimated that Zuckerberg s net worth dropped over the last month from  71 billion to  61 7 billion  Facebook s market value has fallen by more than  88 billion in less than three weeks since the scandal broke  from nearly  538 billion in mid March to about  449 5 billion    Associated Press writer Marley Jay in New York contributed to this report

SAN FRANCISCO    Facebook Inc Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said on Tuesday that he agreed  in spirit  with a strict new European Union law on data privacy but stopped short of committing to it as the standard for the social network across the world As Facebook reels from a scandal over the mishandling of personal information belonging to millions of users  the company is facing demands to improve privacy and learn lessons from the landmark EU law scheduled to take effect next month Zuckerberg told Reuters in a phone interview that Facebook was working on a version of the law that would work globally  bringing some European privacy guarantees worldwide  but the 33 year old billionaire demurred when asked what parts of the law he would not extend worldwide  We re still nailing down details on this  but it should directionally be  in spirit  the whole thing   Zuckerberg said  He did not elaborate His comments signal that U S  Facebook users  many of them still angry over the company s admission that political consultancy Cambridge Analytica got hold of Facebook data on 50 million members  could find themselves in a worse position than Europeans The European law  called the General Data Protection Regulation  GDPR   is the biggest overhaul of online privacy since the birth of the internet  giving Europeans the right to know what data is stored on them and the right to have it deleted Apple Inc and some other tech firms have said they do plan to give people in the United States and elsewhere the same protections and rights that Europeans will gain Shares of Facebook closed up 0 5 percent on Tuesday at  156 11   110 8   They are down more than 15 percent since March 16  when the scandal broke over Cambridge Analytica PUSH FOR DATA PRIVACYPrivacy advocacy groups have been urging Facebook and its Silicon Valley competitors such as Alphabet Inc s Google to apply EU data laws worldwide  largely without success  We want Facebook and Google and all the other companies to immediately adopt in the United States and worldwide any new protections that they implement in Europe   said Jeff Chester  executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy  in Washington Zuckerberg said many of the tools that are part of the law  such as the ability of users to delete all their data  are already available for people on Facebook  We think that this is a good opportunity to take that moment across the rest of the world   he said   The vast majority of what is required here are things that we ve already had for years across the world for everyone  Google and Facebook are the global leaders in internet ad revenue  Both based in California  they possess enormous amounts of data on billions of people Google has declined to comment on its plans When GDPR takes effect on May 25  people in EU countries will gain the right to transfer their data to other social networks  for example  Facebook and its competitors will also need to be much more specific about how they plan to use people s data  and they will need to get explicit consent GDPR is likely to hurt profit at Facebook because it could reduce the value of ads if the company cannot use personal information as freely and the added expense of hiring lawyers to ensure compliance with the new law Data is central to Facebook s advertising business  and it has not yet sketched out a satisfying plan for how it plans to comply  said Pivotal Research analyst Brian Wieser  I haven t heard any solutions from Facebook to get ahead of the problem yet   Wieser said Failure to comply with the law carries a maximum penalty of up to 4 percent of annual revenue It should not be difficult for companies to extend EU practices and policies elsewhere because they already have systems in place  said Nicole Ozer  director of technology and civil liberties at the American Civil Liberties Union of California Companies  promises are less reassuring than laws  she said   If user privacy is going to be properly protected  the law has to require it   Reporting by David Ingram and Joseph Menn in San Francisco  Additional reporting by Salvador Rodriguez   Editing by Peter Henderson  Bill Rigby and Himani Sarkar

SAN FRANCISCO   Worried about someone hacking the next election  Bothered by the way Facebook and Equifax coughed up your personal information The technology industry has an answer called the blockchain   even for the problems the industry helped to create The first blockchain was created in 2009 as a new kind of database for the virtual currency Bitcoin  where all transactions could be stored without any banks or governments involved Now  countless entrepreneurs  companies and governments are looking to use similar databases   often independent of Bitcoin   to solve some of the most intractable issues facing society  People feel the need to move away from something like Facebook and toward something that allows them to have ownership of their own data   said Ryan Shea  a co founder of Blockstack  a New York company working with blockchain technology The creator of the World Wide Web  Tim Berners Lee  has said the blockchain could help reduce the big internet companies  influence and return the web to his original vision  But he has also warned that it could come with some of the same problems as the web Blockchain allows information to be stored and exchanged by a network of computers without any central authority  In theory  this egalitarian arrangement also makes it harder for data to be altered or hacked Investors  for one  see potential  While the price of Bitcoin and other virtual currencies have plummeted this year  investment in other blockchain projects has remained strong  In the first three months of 2018  venture capitalists put half a billion dollars into 75 blockchain projects  more than double what they raised in the last quarter of 2017  according to data from Pitchbook Most of the projects have not gotten beyond pilot testing  and many are aimed at transforming mundane corporate tasks like financial trading and accounting  But some experiments promise to transform fundamental things  like the way we vote and the way we interact online  There is just so much it can do   said Bradley Tusk  a former campaign manager for Michael R  Bloomberg  the former mayor of New York  who has recently thrown his weight behind several blockchain projects   I love the fact that you can transmit data  information and choices in a way that is really hard to hack   really hard to disrupt and that can be really efficient  Mr  Tusk  the founder of Tusk Strategies  is an investor in some large virtual currency companies  He has also supported efforts aimed at getting governments to move voting online to blockchain based systems  Mr  Tusk argues that blockchains could make reliable online voting possible because the votes could be recorded in a tamper proof way  Everything is moving toward people saying   I want all the benefits of the internet  but I want to protect my privacy and my security    he said   The only thing I know that can reconcile those things is the blockchain  Blockchains assemble data into so called blocks that are chained together using complicated math  Since each block is built off the last one and includes information like time stamps  any attempt to go back and alter existing data would be highly complicated  In the original Bitcoin blockchain  the data in the blocks is information about Bitcoin wallets and transactions  The blocks of data in the Bitcoin blockchain   and most of its imitators   are kept by a peer to peer computer network The novel structure allows people to set up online accounts that can securely hold valuable personal information without having to trust a single entity that can hoard  abuse or lose control of the data  as happened with Facebook and the consumer credit reporting agency Equifax A range of corporations and governments are trying to apply the blockchain model   for projects from the prosaic to the radical  Various departments of the United Nations now have blockchain experiments looking to tackle climate change  the delivery of humanitarian aid and the identity challenges faced by stateless people  Coca Cola and the State Department recently announced a project to register foreign employees on a blockchain in an attempt to eliminate forced labor These experiments have drawn skepticism from Bitcoin aficionados  who say blockchains are being applied to problems that could be more easily solved with old fashioned databases Other critics say the rapid pace of blockchain development could lead to the same problem facing the broader tech industry  a willingness to disrupt and overthrow old systems before the replacement has been thoroughly tested  The blockchain industry is ready and waiting to say   Yes  we are the solution   and they have every incentive to do so   said Angela Walch  a research fellow at the Center for Blockchain Technologies at University College London   But somebody needs to ask the question   Is it actually better  Is it measurably better   Many blockchain projects opened themselves to criticism and regulatory scrutiny by raising money through so called initial coin offerings last year  These fund raising campaigns often brought in tens of millions of dollars in minutes with little regulatory oversight But new blockchain efforts continue apace  motivated in no small part by concerns about the emergence of internet giants like Facebook and YouTube Most of the biggest internet companies make their money from collecting personal information and using it to sell targeted advertisements  This kind of massive data collection makes them vulnerable to hackers and outsiders who want to leverage the data   as was evident when Cambridge Analytica improperly gained access to 50 million Facebook profiles  And start ups are using the blockchain in an attempt to pry control of all that data out of their hands Blockstack has built a way to record the basic details about your identity on a blockchain database and then use that identity to set up accounts with other online projects that are built on top of it The animating force behind the project is that users   rather than Blockstack or any other company   would end up in control of all the data they generate with any online service Blockstack is one of several blockchain based projects hoping to create a new generation of online services that don t rely on having unfettered access to our personal information The idea has gained enough steam that in the days after news of Facebook s relationship with Cambridge Analytica broke  Twitter was filled with people calling for blockchain based alternatives  As Facebook is collapsing we need to replace it with a blockchain based  decentralized platform   one user   GerdMoeBehrens  wrote   blockchain WE NEED U NOW     wrote another   andymartin46 But Mr  Berners Lee has warned that the development of the blockchain could come with unintended consequences  like more activity from criminals operating outside the oversight of governments Even blockchain advocates say the hype has conditioned people to think that good answers are close at hand  when it could take five or 10 years for the technology to properly develop In fact  most blockchain projects are still plagued by concerns about privacy  For example  the widely used Bitcoin blockchain allows certain data   details of the transactions between users   to be seen by anyone  even if other data   the users  identities   remains obscured  Voting start ups have solved this by encrypting the data before putting it on a blockchain  but there are questions about whether this will solve other privacy concerns Blockchain based accounts also rely on users keeping their own passwords or private keys  which people are famously bad at doing  With Bitcoin  when people lose their private key they lose access to the money in their account   if someone lost the private key to a blockchain based online account  they could lose access to their identity  We re not saying that tomorrow you can flip the switch and a blockchain is going to solve these problems   said Michael Casey  a co author of  The Truth Machine   a new book on the blockchain   What s important is how it opens the door to a new way of thinking about the problems we face

2016 for  Brexit   fears grew that the post war economic order was under serious threat  But European stock markets recovered  including Britain s  Investors came to see that the European Union was not going to break up  and Britain was not going to erect tall walls around its economy  Looking back  the panicky early reaction to Brexit seems to have sprung more from a fear of the unknown than any big threats to the global trading system  Investors took a deep breath and gained some perspective Movements in the United States stock market suggests the same thing is happening in response to President Trump s trade policies  China on Tuesday evening announced the tariffs it plans in retaliation against those President Trump is threatening  Reacting to China s announcement  the S  P  500 index plunged early on Wednesday but recovered strongly to close up 1 2 percent Investors may believe China s move will lead to drawn out negotiations  Here  Brexit is again illustrative  As the back and forth between the European Union and Britain has gone on  investors have gained more clarity and confidence  If talks between the U S  and China gain steam  the uncertainty now clouding relations between the two countries may gradually clear But the standoff between the U S  and China differs in important ways from the Brexit tensions  The U S   for instance  is in a much stronger position than Britain  China exports far more to the U S  than the U S  does to China  Limiting access to the U S  economy could hurt China s growth at a time when it is trying to overhaul important economic sectors  If investors believe that the U S  can successfully exploit its advantages to make China more friendly to foreign businesses  they may even see the trade skirmish as positive for the global economy But Brexit also flashes a warning to those expecting a big win for Mr  Trump  One of the reasons that the European Union has presented a united front is that it sees Brexit as a threat to its values and goals  Similarly  China may believe that Mr  Trump s trade attack puts some of its most deeply held aspirations under threat   and will fight back hard   Peter EavisAfter Citigroup

election with Cambridge Analytica  a political consulting firm connected to President Trump The new figure sharply increased the company s previous estimate of how many users  information was harvested by Cambridge Analytica  The number had been put at more than 50 million users The sharing of the user data has unleashed a torrent of criticism at Facebook  the world s largest social network  The company s stock is down sharply since The New York Times and The Observer of London reported on how Cambridge Analytica improperly acquired users  data The company released the revised estimate of affected users in an extended statement on Wednesday about its plans for handling personal data  The company said it will start alerting users on April 9 about whether their information may have been shared with Cambridge Analytica In related Facebook news  Earlier on Wednesday  lawmakers in Washington had said Facebook s chief executive  Mark Zuckerberg  would testify before the

SAN FRANCISCO   Ryan Knight  a Democratic activist in Los Angeles  called for a boycott of Apple in February because it hadn t responded to calls to delete a channel from the National Rifle Association from its streaming video service after the Parkland  Fla   school shooting  Dear  Apple   Mr  Knight wrote on Twitter   Your silence is deafening   BoycottApple   More than 330 accounts retweeted the message How did Mr  Knight post the message  He used an iPhone As the reach and influence of Silicon Valley s tech giants have increased  so have the calls to boycott their products and services  The problem is that pulling off a boycott is not exactly easy  The tech companies  products are so pervasive that they are difficult to avoid That issue was crystallized in recent weeks with Facebook  Hundreds of people deleted their accounts after revelations that the political data firm Cambridge Analytica had improperly harvested the information of 50 million Facebook users  Yet many of those same people promptly instructed their friends to find them on Instagram  which is owned by   you guessed it   Facebook  It s exactly the same company  I realize it s ridiculous   said Sachi Cunningham  a documentary filmmaker in San Francisco who deactivated her Facebook last week and shifted her attention to Instagram  where  she said  the conversation is less toxic Ms  Cunningham  who has freelanced for The New York Times  added that she had immediately begun missing Facebook as a research tool for her documentaries   I don t know if I can get out of the ecosystem   she said People looking to punish major tech companies by abstaining from their products have been bedeviled time and again by the difficulty in escaping them  After Google fired an engineer  James Damore  for criticizing the company s diversity efforts last year  hundreds of people on social media called for a boycott of the company  But an analysis of nearly 7 000 tweets using the hashtag  BoycottGoogle since August showed that 26 percent of the tweets came from devices using Google s Android software  according to Keyhole  a social media research firm One Twitter account named Milton Prescott tweeted on Aug  8   Google s firing of James Damore proves his point completely  I will no longer be using Google for any services   BoycottGoogle   The tweet came from an Android device  A message to the account went unreturned Even Breitbart is running into the same dilemma  The conservative website is planning to host a panel on how tech platforms like Facebook suppress conservative voices   and it said it would livestream the discussion on Facebook  Breitbart didn t respond to a request for comment Marisa Richardson  a program manager at a life sciences company  said she began boycotting Amazon recently after learning that it offered the NRA channel on its streaming video service  So when she needed laundry detergent  she avoided the e commerce site and instead braved the crowds and traffic   and spent a few dollars more   at a nearby Target But a few days later she shopped at the Whole Foods near her home in Oakland  Calif   I completely forgot that they re owned by Amazon   she said After the shooting in Parkland in February  gun control activists called for a boycott of certain Apple and Amazon services because they hosted the NRA channel People used the hashtag  March1NRABoycott to spread the message on social media  An analysis of about 58 500 tweets with the hashtag showed that nearly half came from an iPhone or an iPad  according to Keyhole  Those included popular tweets using the  March1NRABoycott hashtag from the actress Alyssa Milano  Had I sent the same tweets from an Android phone  the same issue would apply  There is an NRATV app for Android phones   Ms  Milano said through a spokeswoman   We are only just beginning to understand how these companies have infiltrated not only our ideologies  but also our lives in the most in depth way imaginable  Nearly a third of the 4 700 tweets using the  BoycottApple hashtag since August came from iPhones  according to Keyhole  I do have an iPhone  but as a customer of Apple s  am I not allowed to hold them accountable   Mr  Knight  the activist who used an iPhone to call for an Apple boycott  said in an interview Eddy Cue  a senior executive at Apple  recently said that the NRA channel didn t violate the company s policies  Facebook  Google and Amazon didn t respond to requests for comment Many of those who recently abandoned their Facebook accounts are still in the company s orbit  not only with Instagram but also with the company s popular messaging apps WhatsApp and Messenger When Cher recently deleted her Facebook page  she said on Twitter   2day I did something VERY HARD 4 me   But her Instagram account  with 768 000 followers  was still active Likewise  Elon Musk  chief executive of SpaceX and Tesla  deleted the Facebook pages of both companies   but left their pages and his personal account active on Instagram  The photo sharing platform  he said on Twitter  is fine  so long as it stays fairly independent  Stephen Cox  39  a woodworker in Los Angeles  recently posted on Facebook that he was deactivating his account in favor of Instagram  When someone commented that the two sites were owned by the same company  he replied   It s a double edged sword  but for me one edge is slightly more blunt than the other  Instagram has proved an effective hedge for Facebook against people losing interest or trust in its main site  While the percentage of American adults who use Facebook has remained flat at 68 percent since 2016  according to a January survey of 2 002 American adults by the Pew Research Center  Instagram use rose to 35 percent from 28 percent over that period  Instagram is also more popular with younger people than older people  according to the survey Rayven Bruzzese  26  a sign language student in Philadelphia  said she had been a frequent user of Facebook for years but deleted her account in March because she found it upsetting and a drain on her time  Now she spends her time on Instagram While she acknowledged the irony of moving to another Facebook owned service  she said her options were limited  Few of her friends are on Twitter  and many have stopped using Snapchat  Where am I supposed to go   she said   I wish there was something else  
Amazon ran a commercial on this year s Super Bowl that pretended its digital assistant Alexa had temporarily lost her voice  It featured celebrities like Rebel Wilson  Cardi B and even the company s chief executive  Jeff Bezos While the ad riffed on what Alexa can say to users  the more intriguing question may be what she and other digital assistants can hear   especially as more people bring smart speakers into their homes Amazon and Google  the leading sellers of such devices  say the assistants record and process audio only after users trigger them by pushing a button or uttering a phrase like  Hey  Alexa  or  O K   Google   But each company has filed patent applications  many of them still under consideration  that outline an array of possibilities for how devices like these could monitor more of what users say and do  That information could then be used to identify a person s desires or interests  which could be mined for ads and product recommendations In one set of patent applications  Amazon describes how a  voice sniffer algorithm  could be used on an array of devices  like tablets and e book readers  to analyze audio almost in real time when it hears words like  love   bought  or  dislike   A diagram included with the application illustrated how a phone call between two friends could result in one receiving an offer for the San Diego Zoo and the other seeing an ad for a Wine of the Month Club membership Some patent applications from Google  which also owns the smart home product maker Nest Labs  describe how audio and visual signals could be used in the context of elaborate smart home setups One application details how audio monitoring could help detect that a child is engaging in  mischief  at home by first using speech patterns and pitch to identify a child s presence  one filing said  A device could then try to sense movement while listening for whispers or silence  and even program a smart speaker to  provide a verbal warning  A separate application regarding personalizing content for people while respecting their privacy noted that voices could be used to determine a speaker s mood using the  volume of the user s voice  detected breathing rate  crying and so forth   and medical condition  based on detected coughing  sneezing and so forth  The same application outlines how a device could  recognize a T shirt on a floor of the user s closet  bearing Will Smith s face and combine that with a browser history that shows searches for Mr  Smith  to provide a movie recommendation that displays   You seem to like Will Smith  His new movie is playing in a theater near you   In a statement  Amazon said the company took  privacy seriously  and did  not use customers  voice recordings for targeted advertising   Amazon said that it filed  a number of forward looking patent applications that explore the full possibilities of new technology   and that they  take multiple years to receive and do not necessarily reflect current developments to products and services  Google said it did not  use raw audio to extrapolate moods  medical conditions or demographic information   The company added   All devices that come with the Google Assistant  including Google Home  are designed with user privacy in mind  Tech companies apply for a dizzying number of patents every year  many of which are never used and are years from even being possible Still  Jamie Court  the president of Consumer Watchdog  a nonprofit advocacy group in Santa Monica  Calif   which published a study of some of the patent applications in December  said   When you read parts of the applications  it s really clear that this is spyware and a surveillance system meant to serve you up to advertisers  The companies  Mr  Court added  are  basically going to be finding out what our home life is like in qualitative ways  Google called Consumer Watchdog s claims  unfounded   and said   Prospective product announcements should not necessarily be inferred from our patent applications  A recent Gallup poll found that 22 percent of Americans used devices like Google Home or Amazon Echo  The growing adoption of smart speakers means that gadgets  some of which contain up to eight microphones and a camera  are being placed in kitchens and bedrooms and used to answer questions  control appliances and make phone calls  Apple recently introduced its own version  called the HomePod But many consumers are also becoming increasingly nervous that tech companies are eavesdropping on them in order to serve them targeted ads  no matter how often the companies deny it  The recent revelations that a British political data firm  Cambridge Analytica  improperly harvested the information of 50 million Facebook users has only added to the public s wariness over the collection and use of personal information Facebook  in fact  had planned to unveil its new internet connected home products at a developer conference in May  according to Bloomberg News  which reported that the company had scuttled that idea partly in response to the recent fallout Both Amazon and Google have emphasized that devices with Alexa and Google Assistant store voice recordings from users only after they are intentionally triggered  Amazon s Echo and its newer smart speakers with screens use lights to show when they are streaming audio to the cloud  and consumers can view and delete their recordings on the Alexa smartphone app or on Amazon s website  though they are warned online that  may degrade  their experience   Google Home also has a light that indicates when it is recording  and users can similarly see and delete that audio online Amazon says voice recordings may help fulfill requests and improve its services  while Google says the data helps it learn over time to provide better  more personalized responses But the ecosystem around voice data is still evolving Take the thousands of third party apps developed for Alexa called  skills   which can be used to play games  dim lights or provide cleaning advice  While Amazon said it didn t share users  actual recordings with third parties  its terms of use for Alexa say it may share the content of their requests or information like their ZIP codes  Google says  it will  generally  not provide audio recordings to third party service providers  but may send transcriptions of what people say And some devices have already shown that they are capable of recording more than what users expect  Google faced some embarrassment last fall when a batch of Google Home Minis that it distributed at company events and to journalists were almost constantly recording In a starker example  detectives investigating a death at an Arkansas home sought access to audio on an Echo device in 2016  Amazon resisted  but the recordings were ultimately shared with the permission of the defendant  James Bates   A judge later dismissed Mr  Bates s first degree murder charge based on separate evidence  Kathleen Zellner  his lawyer  said in an interview that the Echo had been recording more than it was supposed to  Mr  Bates told her that it had been regularly lighting up without being prompted  and had logged conversations that were unrelated to Alexa commands  including a conversation about football in a separate room  she said  It was just extremely sloppy the way the activation occurred   Ms  Zellner said The Electronic Privacy Information Center has recommended more robust disclosure rules for internet connected devices  including an  algorithmic transparency requirement  that would help people understand how their data was being used and what automated decisions were then being made about them Sam Lester  the center s consumer privacy fellow  said he believed that the abilities of new smart home devices highlighted the need for United States regulators to get more involved with how consumer data was collected and used  A lot of these technological innovations can be very good for consumers   he said   But it s not the responsibility of consumers to protect themselves from these products any more than it s their responsibility to protect themselves from the safety risks in food and drugs  It s why we established a Food and Drug Administration years ago  
 Good Monday  Here s what we re watching   Elon Musk finally responded to last week s bad news about Tesla   Trump continues to go after Amazon   China retaliated to President Trump s steel and aluminum tariffs   Tech leaders have been keeping mum on Facebook Get this in your inbox each morning  Sign up here For months  the stock market rally seemed to have the strength to plow through the obstacles that the Trump administration threw in its way But now  the S  P  500 index is down more than 10 percent from its all time high President Donald Trump s actions seem to be increasingly taking their toll  When the Trump administration first pushed for steel and aluminum tariffs in February  investors weren t happy  but the market soon rebounded  Now investors seem to be growing more nervous as the United States  biggest trading partners show signs that they are ready to fight back  China s retaliatory tariffs  which appear to be more stringent than expected  suggest the country will take a hard stance Early in his presidency  investors quickly learned to shrug off  Mr  Trump s criticism of companies  In recent days  though  Mr  Trump has targeted Amazon in tweets  asserting that the company has an unfair advantage  It s not clear what he could do to hurt Amazon s business  but the company s stock has plunged  Amazon s shares may well bounce back  but the criticism has added to investors  concerns about the outlook for large technology companies  whose soaring stock prices spearheaded the rally that took to the S  P  500 to its all time high in January Too much blame can be placed on the White House  however Before investors began fretting about tech and trade  the underpinnings of the stock market s ascent were perhaps not as robust as they looked  Wall Street analysts expect earnings for the companies in the S  P  500 to increase 25 percent this year  according to data compiled by Standard   Poor s  an unusually large jump that was reflected in the stock market valuations  Much of that projected earnings increase is coming from tax cuts and some from expectations that companies  revenue would grow at a nice clip as global growth stayed strong The tax cuts are certainly going to improve profits  But rising interest rates around the world could weigh somewhat on companies  revenue growth  And if wages and other costs come in higher than expected   a significant possibility when the economy is suffering a shortage of some workers   profit margins could get squeezed   I don t think either of those are in the numbers   said Jim Paulsen  chief market strategist at the Leuthold Group   Peter EavisA little humor has not cleared the clouds over Tesla Shares in the company were once again sliding on Monday after the company s C E O   Elon Musk  joked on April 1 that Tesla had gone bankrupt  an apparent attempt to make light of concerns that the electric car maker is straining under its debt load Tesla s stock is now down 35 percent from its high of last year  A major reason for the slide is the company s struggles to meet production targets for its lower priced Model 3 car  Delays  of course  raise questions about Tesla s ability to become an efficient mass producer of autos  The company needs to sell a significantly higher number of cars to generate the cash to finance its business and meet debt payments  Tesla is expected early this week to release its first quarter production and delivery numbers Electrek  a publication that covers electric vehicles  reported late Monday morning that Mr  Musk had sent out an email to employees saying that the company was producing more than 2 000 Model 3s a week  Tesla s stock bounced after the report Tesla s technology is also facing intense scrutiny after one of its Model X cars crashed on March 23  killing the driver  Tesla said late Friday that its assisted driving system  called Autopilot  was engaged in the car before its collision with a concrete divider  As our colleague Neal E  Boudette wrote Tesla s website says one of Autopilot s safety features is  Automatic Emergency Braking   But a Tesla owner s manual warns riders that this feature  is not designed to avoid a collision   Wired recently reported that systems like Autopilot are not necessarily designed to detect static obstacles  In the words of one expert Doubts about the fundamental capabilities of Tesla s Autopilot could crimp demand for its cars among a customer base that is often seeking the best technology Questions are also swirling around the timing of Tesla s announcement about the crash  In its first communication about the accident  the company said The investigation is not over  Yet Tesla went ahead and provided its update on Friday  The motive for doing so is not clear  The United States National Transportation Safety Board on Sunday said it was  unhappy  that Tesla had released information about the crash   Peter EavisTech companies are again dragging down stocks on Wall Street The S  P  500 and the tech heavy Nasdaq Composite are off 3 1 percent and 3 5 percent Monday  The continued fall in the share prices of some of the biggest tech companies is weighing heavily on the indexes Amazon is down 5 4 percent  Netflix is off 5 9 percent  Facebook fell 3 percent  Google parent Alphabet slipped 3 6 percent and Apple dropped 5 9 percent After leading the market higher for much of the past two years  tech stocks have hit some turbulence  Since March 16  Facebook  Alphabet  Netflix and Amazon are all down more than 12 percent  while Apple is down 7 3 percent Over that period the business models of those companies have come under increased scrutiny  News that Cambridge Analytica  a political data firm hired by President Trump s 2016 election campaign  gained access to private information on more than 50 million Facebook users has weighed not only on the shares of Facebook but on Alphabet as well  Amazon  meanwhile  has come under attack from President Trump In all  those companies have lost more than  300 billion in market value the past two weeks President Trump attacked the e commerce again on Monday morning Monday s tweet is the latest over the past five days from Mr  Trump criticizing Amazon  Over that period  Mr  Trump has accused Amazon of not paying enough taxes  of putting thousands of local retailers out of business and of using the United States Postal Service as its  Delivery Boy  Mr  Trump s willingness to again single out Amazon and characterize it as a tax cheat and a job killer is a remarkable use of the presidential bully pulpit that could have serious implications for the company even without any formal moves by the federal government Amazon s shares are down 4 percent and are off nearly 11 percent since Axios reported on Wednesday about Mr  Trump s anger toward the company Context  Amazon has said that the Postal Regulatory Commission  which oversees the service  has consistently found that its contracts with Amazon are profitable   The internet giant collects sales taxes on its own products in all 45 states that have one  but third party vendors who sell products on the site often do not collect sales tax  a fact that rivals say is unfair  In addition  some municipalities complain that the company does not collect local taxes Critic s cornerDA Davidson analyst Tom Forte wrote in a

investors In January  Mr  Cohen reconfigured Point72 as a hedge fund after establishing it as a family office in 2014 to manage  11 billion of his personal wealth  Point72 has said it has raised between  2 billion and  4 billion in outside money Mr  Villhauer had been with Mr  Cohen through both the good days and bad days  He was there when SAC turned into a powerhouse hedge fund  and he was there when the fund pleaded guilty to insider trading charges in 2013  The guilty plea required the firm to stop managing money for outside investors When Mr  Villhauer left Point72  Mr  Cohen  in a letter to employees  called the departure a  retirement  and said he was sad to see Mr  Villhauer go Now Mr  Villhauer will start a new chapter in his career at another well known hedge fund firm

DES MOINES  Iowa    The Iowa Supreme Court on Friday upheld the conviction of a high school teacher who claimed his only physical contact with the student was hugging  finding that the hugging amounted to sexual misconduct in light of instant messages that showed she had  become the object of  his sexual desires Bradley Wickes  a 38 year old former Camanche High School social studies teacher  was convicted in 2015 of a charge of sexual exploitation by a school employee and sentenced to five years in prison Although the only physical contact Wickes had with the 17 year old student were hugs at school and school related events  the court concluded that more than a thousand Facebook Messenger exchanges between them over 45 days indicated that she had  become the object of Wickes s fantasies and sexual desires  and the hugs that coincided with these messages were for his sexual gratification  Wickes challenged the conclusion that hugging a student constituted sexual conduct  But the justices ruled against him  pointing out that rulings in other states   including Maryland in 2013  Oregon in 2009 and Vermont in 2006   found that hugging can constitute sexual exploitation in certain cases  They said they would not narrow the scope of the teacher sexual exploitation law by finding that hugs alone cannot amount to sexual conduct The court acknowledged that there was no evidence showing that Wickes had engaged in a sex act with the teen or any physical contact other than hugging  but it said the Facebook Messenger exchanges show how attractive he found her and how he wanted a more intimate relationship with her  Of critical importance in our analysis is the context and circumstances that surrounded the physical contact   the hugs   that are at issue here   the court said  This context begins with Wickes initiating the text messaging and  continues with the scenario of a 36 year old teacher incessantly messaging a 17 year old female student to describe intimate details of his marriage and his sexual frustrations  In one exchange  he wrote to her   You re hot obviously  But you re soulful  I don t know how to explain it you re just captivating  and  you make me feel great  In another  Wickes described how he liked to give sensual back rubs by  lightly caressing with finger tips and       spelling out words   He told the girl that he had  magical fingers   and that he would  trac e  along the back side of the leg and circles around the knee  Following this exchange  Wickes asked the girl   Do you delete these messages  I think I d be killed if your dad found them  Within days of that message  the girl s family discovered the relationship and took her cellphone to the police  Wickes resigned and was charged soon thereafter Although the justices determined that the hugging was illegal in this case  they said teachers shouldn t be overly worried about innocent hugs with students  It is important to note that nothing should prohibit teachers from hugging students for reassurance  comfort  or in congratulation without putting themselves at risk of being charged with the crime of sexual exploitation   the court wrote The court also upheld Wickes  five year prison sentence  finding that it wasn t cruel or unusual punishment  The fact that Wickes s crime involved hugs instead of an actual sex act does not take away from the emotional and psychological toll his actions had on the student he exploited   the court said  adding  his punishment reflects the fact that Wickes abused his position of trust as a teacher to sexually exploit a student for his own gratification  Wickes  attorneys didn t immediately reply to a phone message seeking comment about the ruling    
NEW YORK    Though Facebook gets the attention because of a recent privacy gaffe  the social network is far from alone in collecting massive amounts of data on you to help marketers sell you stuff Google  for one  also does extensive tracking to power its advertising engines  And many other websites and apps run ads sold by Facebook and Google and exchange data with them  Beyond that  plenty of services including Uber and Amazon keep detailed histories on you Here are some of the ways to block or minimize such tracking   but they come with trade offs    TRACKING IDsWebsites have long used unique IDs in  cookies    data files stored in your browser   to know it s you when you return a week later  Cookies also let advertising networks run by the likes of Facebook and Google connect you as you visit multiple websites  Phones and tablets have a device advertising ID that apps can use to track you   Combatting this  You can reset the cookie ID by clearing cookies periodically  Most browsers also have a private mode to limit tracking through cookies  though it s not foolproof  Companies can still link you if you ve signed in  for instance  As for the device ID  you can reset that or tell advertisers not to target ads through the phone s settings Many browsers also let you install add ons that block ad trackers  Notable add ons include Ghostery or the Electronic Frontier Foundation s Privacy Badger   The trade offs  You ll still get ads  just not targeted ones  And clearing cookies makes your browser forget who you are  so you ll have to sign back into any site that was saving your login  Tracker blockers can sometimes prevent websites from displaying or working properly    LOCATION SERVICESMany apps need your location to work  Mapping apps  for instance  can t tell you when to turn without knowing where you are  Video services typically have rights only in certain countries and need to verify your location  But location can be used for much more  Google  for instance  keeps a fairly detailed account of your whereabouts through a feature called Timeline   Combatting this  You can turn off location services in the phone s settings  though for apps to work property  it s better to turn them off for specific services that don t really need them  As for Timeline  you can pause or delete location history in Google settings   The trade offs  Some apps won t work without your location  Others  such as weather apps  will require you enter your location manually  And you might miss out on recommendations such as better commuting routes via apps like Waze    SIGNING INSigning into an online account gives services a sure fire way of tracking you  Facebook won t work at all without an account  Google merely works better with one  And you ll generally need an account with any service that charges you  although sometimes you can sign in with your Facebook or Google ID instead   Combatting this  Resist creating an account or signing whenever you can   such as when you re merely browsing rather than buying  Avoid using Facebook or Google IDs whenever possible  as those companies could then track you  You can also use a different email address for each account to frustrate efforts to connect you across services  although it can be a major pain   The trade offs  Some services require signing in  and creating accounts on each service means more passwords to remember  though you might consider using a password manager    Whatever you do  don t reuse the same passwords across service  that makes them easy to hack    IP ADDRESSThe Internet Protocol address lists where your phone or computer lives on the internet  it s how you get messages and load websites  But IP addresses can also help companies remember who you are and link the various devices you use  since most homes use a single IP address for the whole network  Databases can also map IP addresses to physical locations   Combatting this  You can mask your IP address by using a secure intermediary  VPN services  common in corporate settings  will route your traffic through a separate IP address  a secure web browser called Tor automatically sends traffic through multiple third parties  You still need to avoid signing in   The trade offs  Tor can slow down performance  particularly with high data tasks such as video  And with VPNs  you need to trust the VPN operator  whether that s your boss or a private service 
 Reuters    Shares of Facebook Inc rose as much as 4 2 percent on Thursday after Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg said the social network had not seen any meaningful impact on usage or ad sales in the wake of a data privacy scandal The company s shares have sunk 16 percent  wiping more than  80 billion from its market value since March 16  when the New York Times and London s Observer newspaper broke news of the use of its data by political consultancy Cambridge Analytica Some investors see the chaos as a chance to snap up shares in a service for which there is scarce alternative  despite rising public scrutiny and the prospect of a grilling from U S  legislators when Zuckerberg testifies before Congress next week Canada s province of British Columbia and Canada s federal government combined investigations on Thursday  saying they had launched a joint probe into Facebook and Canadian data firm AggregateIQ  while Australian authorities said they were exploring whether the social media company had breached user privacy laws The California State Teachers  Retirement System  with nearly  1 billion in Facebook stock as of last year  on Thursday also said it would question the company about privacy protections Despite the probes and celebrities including singer Cher  actor Will Ferrell and Tesla Chief Elon Musk deleting their accounts  Facebook s social app downloads improved on a monthly basis both in the United States and globally  according to Evercore ISI Facebook expanded its share of social app downloads in March by 33 2 percent from 30 1 percent  Evercore data showed Several Wall Street analysts said the stock s decline presented a good opportunity to buy into the social network s previously high flying shares  although they cautioned that much will depend on Zuckerberg s testimony to Congress  We suspect that looking back a year from now  if not sooner  this episode will have been a uniquely compelling buying opportunity in the mega cap internet space   Deutsche Bank analysts said Facebook s chief operating officer  Sheryl Sandberg  told Bloomberg in an interview on Thursday that a few advertisers had paused spending in the wake of the incident  but that the company was having reassuring conversations about how it has built privacy into its system   https   bloom bg 2q89KMt Companies including U S  auto parts retailer Pep Boys  internet company Mozilla and German bank Commerzbank AG have suspended advertisement on the platform Sandberg also said a tool that allowed a researcher to gain access to personal information of up to 87 million users  complied with a privacy agreement the company signed with the U S  Federal Trade Commission  FTC  in 2011 Her comments followed reports that the FTC was investigating the company over a possible violation of that agreement  which demands it to get user consent before sharing their information  While it s clear that investor sentiment has been materially impacted by  the  Cambridge Analytica revelations  we believe FB is acting proactively and aggressively to tighten its privacy controls and increase the level of transparency into its practices   Wells Fargo analyst Ken Sena said Zuckerberg  who will testify about the scandal next week in front of committees in the U S  House and Senate  may face calls from legislators for more oversight Sandberg  in a separate interview with PBS  said   We re not just open to regulations  we re moving ahead of it   and had built a tool which would be live before the next U S  election and which would show details of who paid for election ads and demographics of the audience Facebook shares closed up 2 7 percent at  159 35  Reporting by Supantha Mukherjee  Sonam Rai and Arjun Panchadar in Bengaluru  Mohammad Zargham in Washington  editing by Peter Henderson  Bernard Orr and James Dalgleish

NEW YORK    Facebook s acknowledgement that most of its 2 2 billion members have probably had their personal data scraped by  malicious actors  is the latest example of the social network s failure to protect its users  data Not to mention its apparent inability to even identify the problem until the company was already embroiled in scandal CEO Mark Zuckerberg told reporters Wednesday that Facebook is shutting down a feature that let people search for Facebook users by phone number or email address  Although that was useful for people who wanted to find others on Facebook  it turns out that unscrupulous types also figured out years ago that they could use it to identify individuals and collect data off their profiles The scrapers were at it long enough  Zuckerberg said  that  at some point during the last several years  someone has probably accessed your public information in this way  The only way to be safe would have been for users to deliberately turn off that search feature several years ago  Facebook had it turned on by default  I think Facebook has not been clear enough with how to use its privacy settings   said Jamie Winterton  director of strategy for Arizona State University s Global Security Initiative   That  to me  was the failure  The breach was a stunning admission for a company already reeling from allegations that the political data mining firm Cambridge Analytica inappropriately accessed data on as many as 87 million Facebook users to influence elections Over the past few weeks  the scandal has mushroomed into investigations across continents  including a probe by the U S  Federal Trade Commission  Zuckerberg himself will be questioned by Congress for the first time on Tuesday  The FTC looked the other way for years when consumer groups told them Facebook was violating its 2011 deal to better protect its users  But now the Cambridge Analytica scandal has awoken the FTC from its long digital privacy slumber   said Jeffrey Chester  executive director for the Washington based privacy nonprofit Center for Digital Democracy Neither Zuckerberg nor his company has identified those who carried out the data scraping  Outside experts believe they could have been identity thieves  scam artists or shady data brokers assembling marketing profiles Zuckerberg said the company detected the problem in a data privacy audit started after the Cambridge Analytica disclosures  but didn t say why the company hadn t noticed it   or fixed it   earlier Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday on when it discovered the data scraping In his call with reporters Wednesday  Zuckerberg said the company had tried  rate limiting  the searches  This restricted how many searches someone can conduct at one time from a particular IP address  a numeric designation that identifies a device s location on the internet  But Zuckerberg said the scrapers circumvented that defense by cycling through multiple IP addresses The scraped information was limited to what a user had already chosen to make public   which  depending on a person s privacy settings  could be a lot   as well as what Facebook requires people to share  That includes full name  profile picture and listings of school or workplace networks But hackers and scam artists could then use that information   and combine it with other data in circulation   to pull hoaxes on people  plant malware on their computers or commit other mischief Having access to such a massive amount of data could also pose national security risks  Winterton said A foreign entity could conceivably use such information to influence elections or stir up discord   exactly what Russia is alleged to have done  using Facebook and other social media  in the 2016 presidential elections Privacy advocates have long been critical of Facebook s penchant for pushing people to share more and more information  often through pro sharing default options While the company offers detailed privacy controls   users can turn off ad targeting  for example  or face recognition  and post updates that no one else sees   many people never change their settings  and often don t even know how to The company has tried to simplify its settings multiple times over the years  most recently this week Winterton said that for individual Facebook users  worrying about this data scraping won t do much good   after all  the data is already out there  But she said it might be a good time to  reflect on what we are sharing and how we are sharing it and whether we need to   Just because someone asks us information  it doesn t mean we have to give it to them if we are not comfortable   she said She added that while she no longer has a Facebook account  when she did she put her birth year as 1912 and her hometown as Kuala Lumpur  Malaysia  Neither is true   AP Technology Writer Anick Jesdanun contributed to this story

Want the Australia Letter by email  Sign up and forward to your friends for heaps of global coverage and provocative Australia insight        When Francesca Donner  director of The New York Times Gender Initiative  arrived in Australia a few weeks ago  she was almost immediately swept up in the wave of  MeToo and news media activities In addition to public panels on the  MeToo movement  there were conferences  university discussions and a dinner with young female New York Times readers to talk about our coverage Everyone  it seemed  had something to say about  MeToo On her way back to New York  Francesca jotted down a few impressions about Australia s gender movement and how it compares with what s happening in the United States Her thoughts raised as many questions as they answered

 Barnaby Joyce   And the press  The press  There are so few publications we identify with  Most young people just turn away and shrug   And the defamation laws  It s almost impossible for the press to cover sexual harassment  Meanwhile  sexual harassment is rife in universities  at workplaces and on and on  And yet The Sydney Opera House was hosting a day all about women called  All About Women   Attendees who were mostly women  and a few odd men out  turned out in the thousands  The festival aired around the country on local TV stations  People tuned in And yet The ABC devoted episodes to International Women s Day and two ABC national radio stations  Fran Kelly and Richard Glover  invited me on to talk Harvey Weinstein and  you guessed it  women And yet Gay marriage had been recently legalized  And the city of Sydney would pay homage to the passing of the law at its 40th Anniversary Mardi Gras celebrations  And yet Barnaby Joyce  the former deputy prime minister  a champion of family values  who had fathered a child with a staff member who was not his wife  and accepted a rent free townhouse from a millionaire politician  had stepped down from his post  On the surface it looked like progress but underneath  was it  It got me thinking  What should women  and others  in Australia realistically expect from a gender movement  Are hopes pinned too high  Or do expectations not go far enough  So here are my questions for you  Australia  How do you think the movement in Australia compares with the wave of accountability sweeping the rest of the world And what does gender

SYDNEY  Australia   Australia s boys club political culture appeared in recent weeks to receive a healthy dose of  MeToo disruption First  Robert Doyle  the lord mayor of Melbourne  resigned after two members of the City Council accused him of groping them  Days later  Barnaby Joyce  the deputy prime minister  stepped down after he confessed to an affair with a staff member and was then accused by another woman of harassment The scandal surrounding Mr  Joyce even prompted Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull to ban members of Parliament from having sex with their subordinates   the first time in five years that the rules on ministerial conduct had been updated But according to women who work in the halls of Australian power  the scandals in February were but a tiny sampling of the pervasive culture of sexual harassment endemic to the country s politics Less than a third of the Australian Parliament is female  Canberra  the capital  is frequently described as an old boy s club  with many men s connections   and attitudes about sexual conduct   starting in the elite universities and the youth wings of the major parties that guide the politically ambitious through their 20s  It was clear that a bully boy culture had accumulated over many  many years   said Ellen Sandell  a Greens politician and member of the Victorian State Parliament   It s got to start somewhere  That culture of harassment and protection for powerful men  women say  has prevented more accusers from speaking publicly about encounters with politicians  It has also  they say  stymied a more robust  MeToo movement   akin to those that have rattled Washington and Hollywood   from taking hold  I know it prevented a number of other victims and witnesses  feeling safe to come forward   said Tessa Sullivan  a former Melbourne City Council member who accused Mr  Doyle of harassment   A number of politicians knew about my abuse and tried to deter me from speaking out  Australia s universities are in the early phases of a reckoning Over the past few years  students at the University of Sydney  Australian National University and on several other campuses have mobilized against  rape culture   drawing attention to a lack of punishment for sexual assault and harassment Their efforts led to a nationwide survey of 31 000 university students in which 51 percent said they were sexually harassed at least once in 2016  Advocates said the actual figure might be even higher  in most cases  neither the victims nor bystanders report the episodes   often because they feel nothing will be done Many Australian women a generation removed said it was at least as bad or worse during their student days  And  they said  the culture of student politics did not help Each of Australia s main political parties has an active youth wing   the Young Liberals promote themselves to anyone ages 16 to 31  Young Labor focuses on anyone under 26   and their efforts often overlap with on campus campaigns Many lawmakers started out in this milieu  with student bodies or union boards  before moving to staffing roles  party offices or legislatures  Three of Australia s five most recent prime ministers   Malcolm Turnbull  Tony Abbott and John Howard   began their political careers as students at the University of Sydney The dynamics of power in these groups have not been equal  Women make up only 29 percent of the Young Liberals membership  according to the group s website  Student leaders say men tend to dominate the senior ranks across parties and campuses Regular gatherings of young people in politics   like the annual National Union of Students conference in December   are also notorious for alcohol fueled inappropriate behavior  At one of them  a Queensland Labor man threatened to rape me as I was walking back to my room   said Tammy Franks  a Greens member of the South Australian Legislative Council  who was active in student politics in the  90s   I was on the sexual harassment and grievance committee  and there was a lot of that type of behavior  Politicians have carried their university bred attitudes up the ranks for decades Jacqui Munro  a former Liberal staff member in New South Wales who joined the party in 2011  says the  mixture of older adults and young staffers  in many political workplaces can produce situations where professional and personal boundaries are poorly defined Mr  Joyce  the deputy prime minister  ended up having an extramarital affair with a younger member of his staff   that s the extreme  But there are other problems with combining power  proximity and desire  Closeness can sometimes be misread  especially if alcohol s involved   Ms  Munro said   People can be inappropriately handsy  and sometimes get away with things because it s considered a bit too difficult to manage in a long term sense  You just sort of address it quietly  That tendency to  address it quietly    driven in part by the expectation of party loyalty   often works to preserve the careers of predatory men while women who lodge allegations frequently face an intense backlash  One of the women who accused Mr  Joyce of harassment  a claim he denies  was identified publicly by The Australian  a national conservative newspaper  without her consent And public shaming   also common on university campuses   frequently leads to perpetual silence  or whispering Ms  Sullivan  the former Melbourne council member whose allegation helped topple the city s mayor  he denies the accusation   said women working in Australian politics frequently warn one another privately about male colleagues  conduct  but are often reluctant to accuse their harassers publicly  Female politicians   she said  understand that they have  to take steps to protect themselves from being violated  The threats and abuse span parties and states Ms  Sandell  the Victorian Parliament member  made headlines in 2016 when she called out sexist bullying on the chamber s floor  Sexual harassment had become so pervasive  she said  tour guides stopped allowing primary school students to watch debates taking place in the chamber In Canberra last year  a young volunteer accused the Greens party of mishandling her complaint about an older party member whom she accused of sexually assaulting her on election night In South Australia  Ms  Franks said she  too  sees signs of a  toxic culture   People act like spoiled teenagers  and because they have a lot of power they think they can get away with it   she said   It s like  Mean Girls  in reverse   Mean Blokes   Australia s main political parties  in the wake of scandal after scandal  have said they are trying to improve their relations with women But with the issue confronted only weakly for years  many women in and out of Australian politics say the country must do more to hold men accountable at every phase of life   and to ensure that women are not pushed aside by a culture of abuse  My advice for women who wish to join politics is to find your voice before joining   Ms  Sullivan said   You will need bravery  But  she added   please do give it a go  because we need more women to help shape the world we all live in

LONDON    The Latest on 0900 GMT  all times local  A South Korean mobile device maker says the responsibility for protecting user privacy falls not just on one single company but on all players in the mobile industry LG Electronics Inc   which makes Android phones  also said Tuesday that the role of handset makers to prevent the type of data flap as in the Facebook data scandal is unclear LG Electronics said in a statement that  Privacy is everyone s responsibility   software providers  carriers  as well as device manufacturers  Whether phone manufacturers can block apps from accessing user data is questionable  but Android customers already have that capability now in the form of permissions  LG said it did not have enough details about how to prevent such data breaches  but that if hardware played a role it would seek solutions 
NEW YORK    Fund managers have begun to ditch so called FANG stocks that powered the U S  stock market to record highs in January and are slowly rotating into commodity related shares and other value stocks which typically outperform in late cycle recoveries Portfolio managers holding shares of Facebook Inc  Amazon com Inc  Netflix Inc  and Google parent Alphabet Inc say they are increasingly concerned that the data scandal that has sent shares of Facebook down nearly 15 percent year to date will spill over into all of the FANG stocks  imperiling the broad market s momentum at a time when there are no clear companies or sectors to take their place On Tuesday  an index which tracks the FANG stocks along with six other mega cap technology stocks tumbled 6 3 percent  the biggest decline since September 2014 Facebook rose as much as 1 5 percent in early trading Wednesday before falling into the red  one day after sources told Reuters that chief executive Mark Zuckerberg plans to testify before Congress  Amazon com dropped 4 percent  while Netflix fell 5 percent  Google parent Alphabet was slightly positive  There are legitimate concerns over the business models of these companies  and I expect that they will be ironed out in legislation  that will likely eat into their profit margins  said Michael Cuggino  a portfolio manager of the  17 billion Permanent Portfolio funds Cuggino  who would not say whether he was selling any of his shares in Facebook  said that commodity and industrial stocks look more attractive now given rising inflation and continued global economic growth Each FANG company rose more than 33 percent last year  helping power the S P 500 to a nearly 20 percent gain  Yet those gains have left the broad S P 500 trading at a high trailing price to earnings ratio of 21 7  leaving it overpriced despite a boost to margins from the Republican led corporate tax cut at the end of 2017  Rising volatility and changing market leadership are now pointing towards the possible conclusion that the stock market peaked in late January 2018   said Douglas Kass  president of Seabreeze Capital Management The S P 500 is now down 2 2 percent for the year  and down nearly 10 percent below the high of 2872 87 it reached on Jan  26 UNFRIENDEDFund managers say that the high valuation of FANG stocks and the likelihood of regulation are pushing them into traditional value stocks like energy and defense companies Connor Browne  a portfolio manager at Thornburg Investment Management  said that he sold his shares of Netflix and Amazon com last year after both companies blew through his price targets  He used those gains instead to increase positions in energy stocks such as pipeline operator Enterprise Products Partners LP and crude oil shipping company Overseas Shipholding Group Inc that stand to benefit from the recovery in the price of oil  We noticed that in all of this excitement over the FANGs taking over the world  there are parts of the economy that seem really out of favor and offer more compelling opportunities   he said Even after the selloff  FANG stocks continue to trade at higher valuations than the broad market  Netflix trades at a P E of 210 and Amazon com trades at a P E of 327  Facebook and Google parent Alphabet  both of which have been directly linked with privacy concerns  now trade at valuations near 52 week lows The overhang of increased government oversight has sunk the fortunes of large technology companies in the past  Microsoft Corp reached a settlement in an antitrust case with the Department of Justice in 2002 that lasted until 2011  contributing to a long period of underperformance that kept the stock below the high it reached in 1999 until 2016  Since then  the stock is up nearly 60 percent on the strength of its cloud based services Margaret Patel  a senior portfolio manager at Wells Fargo Funds  said that she has been adding to defense stocks like Raytheon Co that should benefit from increasing military spending in both the U S  and overseas  At the same time  she is increasing her exposure of non FANG technology stocks like Adobe Systems Inc and Microsoft that have been hurt by the recent sell off in the sector  It s very hard to see another sector that still has all the fundamental drivers for growing much faster than any other sector   she said  Reporting by David Randall  Editing by Jennifer Ablan and Nick Zieminski

KUALA LUMPUR  Malaysia    Malaysia s parliament on Monday passed a law prohibiting fake news that critics fear will be abused to silence dissent ahead of a general election Despite warnings such a law would lead Malaysia closer to dictatorship  the bill was approved 123 to 64 after a heated debate  The bill originally proposed a 10 year jail term and a fine of up to 500 000 ringgit   128 000  for offenders  but the approved legislation sets the maximum prison sentence at six years Rights activists say the law appears aimed at shutting down discussion of a multibillion dollar financial scandal involving Prime Minister Najib Razak  who is widely expected to call for national elections in the next few days They also fear the bill  which covers all media and extends even to foreigners outside Malaysia  could be used against critics of gerrymandering or other aspects of the electoral process after parliament last week swiftly approved controversial new constituency boundaries for the elections  which are due in August but widely expected soon  The existing laws are sufficient  why do we need one more act  This will see one step forward to dictatorship  this is more than autocracy   opposition lawmaker Lim Guan Eng told parliament Azalina Othman  minister in charge of law  said social media such as Twitter and Facebook have acknowledged they are unable to monitor fake news on their platforms  She said the bill gives power to the court  not the government  to decide what is fake news  No one is above the law  We are all accountable for our actions   she said Government officials have accused the opposition coalition of using fake news to win votes and warned that any news about the indebted 1MDB state fund that has not been verified by the government is fake The U S  and several other countries are investigating allegations of cross border embezzlement and money laundering at 1MDB  which was set up and previously led by Najib to promote economic development  but which accumulated billions in debt  The U S  Justice Department says at least  4 5 billion was stolen from 1MDB by associates of Najib  and it is working to seize  1 7 billion taken from the fund to buy assets in the U S   potentially its largest asset seizure ever Najib  who denies any wrongdoing  has fired critics in his government and muzzled the media since the corruption scandal erupted three years ago Support for Najib s ruling coalition has dwindled in the last two elections  In 2013  it lost the popular vote for the first time to the opposition  Yet analysts say Najib is expected to win a third term due to infighting in the opposition  the unfavorable electoral boundary changes and strong support for the government among rural ethnic Malays Other Southeast Asian countries  including Singapore and the Philippines  have also proposed laws to clamp down on fake news 
Damien Cave  our Australia bureau chief  shares insights on Australia  news of the world and reader feedback in this weekly newsletter  Want it by email  Sign up       A few months ago  my wife and I were in an Uber in Melbourne talking to a driver from India who had a Ph D in literature  He wrote essays for Indian media outlets but mostly drove  he said  in part because he had a hard time finding a teaching or writing job in Australia Ever since  I ve wondered how many more Uber drivers were like him   foreign  skilled but stuck in the gig or service economy I thought of this again last week  as I reported a story about Ola  the Indian ride sharing company that just started offering service in Perth and Sydney  Ola has not explicitly marketed itself to drivers or riders of Indian origin  but the company does expect that the awareness of its brand among Indians will help   and that idea prompted me to do some more digging The Indian community in Australia doesn t get much attention from local media or politics  but it s a large group  About 1 9 percent of Australia s population of 24 million was born in India  according to 2016 census data  many more are the children of Indian immigrants Sheba Nandkeolyar  the national chairwoman of the Australia India Business Council and the founder of a multicultural marketing company in Sydney  said the Indian diaspora has been growing in leaps and bounds all over Australia  with a wide range of workplace experiences  There s one segment of the Indian diaspora who are migrating and coming in to good jobs   those are in IT  finance  or science and STEM roles   she said   But there is also a group which is finding it hard to break through  especially in more general professions  A 2016 study from Juliet Pietsch  a professor of politics and international relations at Australian National University  found that many Asian immigrants struggle to gain professional work and pay in Australia  Even those who are highly qualified and English fluent permanent residents or Australian citizens tend to earn less than immigrants from Europe Many of India s high achieving immigrants simply give up and start businesses of their own  said Ms  Nandkeolyar  Others join the sharing economy The Uber driver we met in Melbourne didn t seem to mind his fate  He said his children were both receiving university degrees in engineering and he figured they d face fewer barriers But will they  My own research on this issue has shown evidence of structural discrimination in the work force   Professor Pietsch told me Skin color  accent  even just a name hinting at a nonwhite background can be an obstacle to professional advancement and political inclusion   that s according to a growing body of research about race and immigration in Australia  Canada and the United States But what I d like to know is  How is this experience lived out day to day Australia often holds itself up as a model of multiculturalism and skilled immigration  but tensions are growing  The country is once again in the middle of a major debate about immigration and population growth I m interested in getting beyond the politics  into people s lives   to find out more about the hurdles  challenges and successes that come with Australia s ambitious effort to forge a more diverse and international nation Where is integration working  where is it failing  What do you see in your daily life that you think helps or hurts the creation of a  new Australia  We ll be exploring this issue in a variety of ways  but we re always eager for more input  So if you ve had an experience related to this issue  or have a tip for a story about inclusion or exclusion in multicultural Australian life  email nytaustralia nytimes com Oh  and one more thing  If you re

LONDON    Global stock markets fell for a second day Tuesday as investors continued to fret over a looming trade war between the U S  and China and mounting public scrutiny of technology companies Stocks have been trending lower for weeks largely because of a series of tariffs announced by U S  President Donald Trump and the Facebook data privacy scandal  which has raised the prospect of tighter regulation for social media and other tech stocks In the last week  Trump has also tweeted repeatedly about his new favorite foe  Amazon  whose owner also owns The Washington Post  which has been critical of the Trump administration Trump has approved possible higher U S  duties on  50 billion of Chinese goods in response to complaints that Beijing steals or pressures foreign companies to hand over technology  Those tariffs come on top of previous proposals to raise tariffs on imported steel and aluminum In response  China announced it is raising tariffs on  3 billion of U S  goods including pork  apples and steel pipe  increasing the risk of a broader conflict that might depress global trade  The mood remains decidedly bearish  and there is certainly no shortage of reasons to be fearful   said Chris Beauchamp  chief market analyst at IG   It s times like this when investors face a choice   whether to sit and await developments or plunge back in  That was evident in the performance of stocks on Tuesday Returning from the long Easter holiday weekend  Europe s stock markets tracked others lower  though the scale of the losses were diminished by expectations of a rebound on Wall Street later In Europe  Germany s DAX fell 0 8 percent to 11 999 while London s FTSE 100 declined 0 2 percent to 7 037  France s CAC 40 was 0 5 percent lower at 5 140 Wall Street was poised for some solid gains at the open Tuesday with Dow futures and the broader S P 500 futures up 0 5 percent  On Monday  the S P posted its worst start to a quarter since October 2011 and saw the index fall below its 200 day moving average for the first time in almost 2 years U S  technology companies are in the spotlight  notably Amazon  which posted hefty losses of around 5 percent Monday after Trump again voiced his concerns about the company on Twitter The sector was already in the gaze of investors after Facebook s data scandal last month that has raised the prospect of heightened regulation  Netflix  Microsoft and Google parent Alphabet have all seen their share prices decline  Pressure on the sector doesn t appear to be going away in the near term which will continue to act as a drag on indices   said Craig Erlam  senior market analyst at OANDA Earlier in Asia  the Shanghai Composite Index lost 0 8 percent to 3 163 63 and Tokyo s Nikkei 225 shed 0 4 percent to 21 292 29  Sydney s S P ASX 200 declined 0 1 percent to 5 751 90  Elsewhere  Seoul s Kospi ended down 27 points at 2 442 43  Hong Kong s Hang Seng bucked the trend  ending up 0 2 percent at 30 137 49 Elsewhere  the euro was flat at  1 23 while the dollar rose 0 3 percent to 106 23 yen  In the oil markets  a barrel of U S  crude gained 22 cents to  63 23 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange while Bren crude  used to price international oils  rose 29 cents to  67 93 in London 
On a gloomy Friday afternoon in February  Mario Batali sat down for coffee at the Marlton Hotel  a few blocks from Babbo  his restaurant in Greenwich Village  His guest was the food consultant and writer Christine Muhlke Mr  Batali had called the meeting  as he has with several other people whose opinions he trusts  to figure out how his life and career might recover from a disastrous turn In December  a series of news reports about the celebrity chef began tumbling out  Several women described a decades long pattern of abusive behavior both in his empire and at restaurants owned by friends that ranged from lewd  drunken propositions to physical groping  including one incident at the Spotted Pig in the West Village in which a woman appeared too intoxicated to respond Mr  Batali  57  said he didn t recall all the reported episodes  but immediately apologized  His popular  prolific social media feeds largely fell silent  ABC pulled him from its weekday talk show  The Chew   Food Network canceled plans to remake his first program   Molto Mario   Eataly  the Italian food emporium in which he has a minor stake  took his products off its shelves  He stepped away from daily operations in the Batali   Bastianich Hospitality Group  which has 24 restaurants and nearly 2 100 employees Several powerful men  in several industries  have had their worlds kicked out from under them as the  MeToo movement has gathered momentum  As many have removed themselves from public sight  forfeited business interests or sought treatment  a question lingers  Is a comeback from such disgrace possible Mr  Batali  who has never been known for his patience  is asking that question   actively exploring when or whether he should begin his  Friends and associates say he is floating ideas  pondering timelines and examining whether there is a way for him to step back into his career  at least in some fashion Mr  Batali declined to be interviewed  saying he was  still figuring out my stuff   Those who have spoken with him recently said he appears to be deeply introspective and seeking counsel on what his future might hold  both personally and professionally Mr  Batali is examining what he has called his blind spots and considering how life might look when he is not  as he told one person he consulted over the winter   the lead singer   He told a colleague that he is simply trying to learn to be the wallpaper in the room and not the room itself Nonetheless  Mr  Batali has sketched several scenarios that put him in the driver s seat but cede some control  people he has spoken with recently say  One is creating a new company led by a powerful woman chief executive  In early February  he broached the idea with Federica Marchionni  the former president of Dolce   Gabbana  who was briefly the chief executive of Lands  End This month  he is traveling to Rwanda and Greece to work with refugees as a private citizen  He is thinking about creating a program in which chefs can join him a few times a year to help displaced Rwandans as they return to their country On the other hand  Mr  Batali has said  he might just move to the Amalfi Coast He is still wrestling with the future of the restaurant group that he started with his partner  Joe Bastianich  in 1998 when they opened Babbo  The two men are communicating through lawyers these days  negotiating a complicated buyout that is difficult but  both sides said  not acrimonious  The process of his divestiture is going really well considering how complex it is   Mr  Bastianich said last week   The real point of beginning will be when he departs from the company  That s ground zero  It s about creating a post Mario world  When Mr  Batali s name comes up among groups of food professionals over drinks or between sessions at conferences  some say that if any of the men caught in the current wave of sexual harassment scandals can forge a path back  it might be Mr  Batali He still has legions of fans and colleagues who admire and respect his generosity  culinary knowledge and charisma  Many still post their interpretations of his recipes on Instagram  ask him for selfies on the street or urge his return to  The Chew  on Facebook  His restaurants continue to attract customers Still  there seems to be no end to late night television jokes at his expense  His movements around New York are fodder for tabloids and tweets  some suggesting that his past behavior bordered on criminal Few food celebrities want to be connected to him publicly  Privately  some suggest the time has come for a more nuanced approach to replace the scorched earth policy toward men who have harassed women   one that allows something resembling redemption But for Mr  Batali  that door may not be open   at least professionally  Retire and count yourself lucky   said Anthony Bourdain  a longtime friend of Mr  Batali s who has not spoken with him recently   I say that without malice  or without much malice  I am not forgiving  I can t get past it  I just cannot and that s me  someone who really admired him and thought the world of him  Others  including people who have worked for him  say the absence of his food knowledge and his palate would be a loss  Melissa Rodriguez  who took over in 2017 as the executive chef at Mr  Batali s most acclaimed restaurant  Del Posto  often asked him to come to the kitchen to taste new dishes and share his advice   He s been nothing but a generous individual to me   she said Ms  Rodriguez said she never considered leaving the company after his treatment of women came to light   The biggest concern is for my staff   she said   I have a huge staff  and I am not in the business of abandoning people I spend more time with than my family  People whose opinion Mr  Batali has sought are counseling him to take it slowly  and to consider whether he and his family want to endure all that would come if he stepped back into the food business Ms  Muhlke  a former editor at The New York Times Magazine and Bon Appétit  said her advice to any accused chef would be the same   Leave the field   she said   and let us do the work needed to build something better  Ms  Muhlke would not discuss the details of her February meeting with Mr  Batali  but said  my advice to these chefs and restaurateurs is that this is not a scandal  this is a paradigm shift  The old  wait it out and return appearing humbled  prescription no longer applies  Christine C  Quinn  whom Mr  Batali supported during her 2013 run for New York City mayor  is now the president and chief executive of Win  the city s largest provider of shelter for homeless families  She is a friend of Mr  Batali s  and one of the advisers he sought out this winter  She  too  told him to take things very slowly  My advice for him has been since Day 1 to recognize the severity of what has been leveled against him and recognize how absolutely and completely unacceptable his behavior was   she said If he does start a new company  she said  he should give the reins to people who can drastically change the culture that both allowed and hid his behavior  I do give Mario a ton of credit for reaching out to people like myself  and not calling for us to stand with him   Ms  Quinn said   I think that bodes well   She  like others who have spoken with him recently  believes that he is slowly coming to understand the impact of his behavior and the reasons it happened  including his relationship with alcohol  I think he is trying to find a way to engage in real redemptive behavior   Ms  Quinn said

On a rainy Sunday morning  Cristiano Davoli stopped traffic and rushed into the middle of the street to save the day The 45 year old comic book salesman  wearing a Patch Me logo across his chest  emptied a bag of asphalt into a deep and perilous pothole  He beat the pitch down with the back of a shovel  He pounded it with his boots  That s called an emergency intervention   said Mr  Davoli  a vigilante hero in the battle against the voracious potholes that have opened across the city All roads may lead to Rome  but when you get here the mean streets and wrecked pavements will puncture your tires  break your axles  herniate your discs  and in one recent case  swallow your S U V  whole A poisonous Roman cocktail of chronic mismanagement  corruption  bureaucracy  neglect  heavy traffic  rare snow and constant rain has turned Rome s roads into a modern ruin that has surpassed overflowing garbage  busted water pipes and striking bus drivers as the emblem of a degraded city in another decline First come the cracks  resembling spider webs  They give way to the grooved pattern of a dry desert floor  Ultimately gaping potholes open up  Camouflaged in a rainy March under cappuccino colored puddles  they twist ankles  topple zigzagging scooters and turn car rides into brain rattling off road excursions  It s a disaster   said Mr  Davoli  who has made filling potholes his personal mission  risking fines for filling them in unauthorized areas  His appeals to volunteer citywide have been ignored by the mayor The city has closed streets and reduced the speed limit in many places to an ancient Roman crawl  The potholes have caused untold accidents  hours of traffic and windfalls for tire dealers  One pothole was credited with shredding the tires of 15 cars in under an hour The perpetually embattled mayor  Virginia Raggi  this month inaugurated a 17 million euro  Marshall Plan   not to be confused with February s 90 million euro  Pothole Plan   to patch up 50 000 potholes a month  The city has unveiled its  Pothole Patching Machine   which it claims can fill 150 potholes a day  And prosecutors have opened a broad investigation to get to the bottom of the crackup Romans say the problem has never been this bad  but the Raggi administration  which has been in power for nearly two years  blames its predecessors  Margherita Gatta  the city s chief infrastructure official  said that the world s other cities had lots of potholes too  but that it was  normal that the capital makes news  Romans  who do not like walking but don t mind complaining  bemoan an abnormal situation  They have reacted by posting memes on the internet In one  Ms  Raggi is up to her lips in a puddle filled pothole next to the words   It s O K  You can still stand   In another  she takes credit for having built  4 000 swimming pools in Rome  Others show salmon leaping and alligators snapping out of wet potholes  One Facebook group has started an  adopt a pothole  page Real life is no less strange  One man spent an afternoon dipping a fishing line into a hole that seemed a small pond    Boss   a passer by shouted   It s no use    Someone spray painted  pothole  before a pothole in the shadow of the Colosseum  The cobble stoned road from the train station to Piazza Venezia  in the heart of the city  is rutted  and taxi drivers say bobbling tourists laugh as if on an amusement ride Scooter drivers  already accustomed to the new Roman slalom  find the degree of difficulty increased by mogullike bumps raised by pine tree roots and pitch black streets darkened by broken lampposts  Commuters say their backs hurt  Spleens are getting ruptured Milanese always called Rome uncivilized  But now so do people in Naples Romans  conditioned by centuries of seen it all cynicism  sometimes even find themselves astonished In the Monteverde section of the city  Patrizia Ambrosini  70  stopped to look at a 15 foot chasm fenced off on the street  The ground had given way days earlier and engulfed a Dacia Duster  Well  this is a first   she said One traffic officer on the scene said he had taped off the sidewalk next to the sinkhole  not to protect people from the pit  but because a woman gaping at it almost got hit on the head by pieces of stucco falling from the building above it As he explained  Thomasz Sobieszek  47  pulled up on his scooter   I want to show you something   he said  showing the officer an illustration on his smartphone of men in togas building roads   This is how the ancient Romans built their streets  With three levels  Earlier  and the earliest  Roman administrations seemed to care more about road maintenance  The Laws of the Twelve Tables  Rome s first set of rules dating back to 450 B C   included instructions to make straight roads eight feet wide  stipulated what to do in case of water damage and decreed who  shall build and repair the road  Around 300 B C   Romans started building roads to move their troops  citizens and goods  Starting with the Appian Way  named after the censor who ordered its construction  Romans paved an empire  The revolutionary populist Gaius Gracchus helped build public streets because he understood the junction between a road and the rabble s heart Rome protected its streets by limiting chariot traffic and put a daytime ban on commercial carts  Julius Caesar fought to procure the position of temporary commissioner on the Appian Way  ancient stretches of which still stand   Parts of the modern counterpart  the New Appia  don t  On Thursday  another sinkhole opened up under a couple of cars  After Rome collapsed  urban planning fell by the wayside for centuries  In the 1700s  Msgr  Ludovico Sergardi  who oversaw public works at Saint Peter s Basilica  helped introduce the beveled black basalt cobblestones  known as sampietrini  which are central to the city s charm  Lore has it that he started laying them down after potholes nearly overturned the pope s carriage But these days  the sampietrini have proved treacherous for the city s many scooters  slippery for dress shoes and murder for stilettos  And they require constant maintenance under heavy traffic In 2005  Mayor Walter Veltroni tried to remove many of the cobblestones to improve traffic conditions  but subsequent administrations had different policies  In the past decade the city s streets have become an unattractive patchwork of asphalt  cobblestone  gravel and rubble  The Via Crucis of the craters   wept the Rome based daily Il Messaggero in November 2014  The next year  the papers lamented  Swiss cheese asphalt   and Italy s consumer association sued the city for using lousy materials that contributed to  pathologies for the vertebrae   A corruption and bribery scandal exposed the plots that led to  the killer potholes  Bernardo Bertoluci  the movie director  made a short film of his motorized wheelchair getting stuck in the street  During the filming of a James Bond movie in central Rome  the actor Daniel Craig banged his head after hitting a pothole with his speeding Aston Martin In May 2016  after the city estimated that half its buses broke down because of damage caused by potholes  or buche  the city introduced the toll free emergency line  060 BUCHE  Today  Mr  Davoli receives the desperate calls of municipal officials with jurisdiction over local roads and personal pothole alerts  like mini Bat signals  on his Facebook page  He scrolled through scores of them while Ada De Donato  75  cheered him and his team on She asked if they also fixed sidewalks  which  marred by uncurbed dogs  shattered Peroni bottles and disjointed concrete  is hardly a refuge   Look at this   she said   I m going to break my neck  Mr  Davoli apologized that he did only roads for now and kept filling holes  His trusty sidekick  Raffaele Scamardì  also wearing a Patch Me sweatshirt  shouted from down the road  Listen   he called   There s another dangerous one over there  They dashed to their car and took off  Slowly  It was a bumpy ride

SEOUL  South Korea   South Korean authorities arrested a former president on Friday on charges of bribery  embezzlement and tax evasion  the country s second former leader to be imprisoned within the past year Lee Myung bak  who was president from 2008 to 2013  was taken to a prison in the capital  Seoul  after a court issued an arrest warrant  Local television stations carried live coverage as prosecutors escorted him from his home in Seoul and took him to jail shortly after midnight His arrest came a year after his successor  former President Park Geun hye  was arrested following her parliamentary impeachment on bribery and other criminal charges  The two former leaders are being held in separate prisons  I consider all this my own fault and feel remorse   Mr  Lee  76  said in a handwritten statement posted on Facebook shortly before his arrest South Korea s current president  Moon Jae in  won an election to replace Ms  Park last May with promises to root out corrupt ties between politics and business that have bedeviled the country for decades In recent weeks  state prosecutors have questioned or arrested several of Mr  Lee s former aides as well as relatives and businessmen as they built their case against the former president  Mr  Lee  a former Hyundai executive  has long been dogged by allegations of corruption  and his arrest had been expected since he was summoned and questioned by prosecutors last week Mr  Lee was accused of collecting more than  10 million in bribes from various sources  including Samsung  the county s largest business conglomerate  when he was a presidential candidate and after he took office  Samsung has not commented on the case  although prosecutors have questioned one of its former vice chairmen and raided his home Prosecutors say that Mr  Lee hid his ownership of a lucrative auto parts maker in the name of relatives and embezzled  32 million from the business  Mr  Lee was also accused of using his presidential power to help settle a legal case implicating the auto parts company  getting a business conglomerate to pay  5 8 million in lawyer fees  they said  If convicted  Mr  Lee could be sentenced to life in prison Almost all of South Korea s presidents have seen their reputations tarnished toward the end of their tenure or during their retirement because of corruption scandals involving them  their relatives or aides  Mr  Lee is the fourth former president to have been arrested on corruption charges since the 1990s The former military dictator Chun Doo hwan was sentenced to death and his friend and successor  Roh Tae woo  was sentenced to 22  years in prison on bribery  mutiny and sedition charges in 1996  Both of their sentences were later reduced  and they were pardoned and released in 1997 Ms  Park  who succeeded Mr  Lee in 2013  became the first South Korean president to be impeached by Parliament  That vote in December 2016 followed weeks of huge demonstrations fueled by accusations that she was involved in a corruption scandal  She was formally removed from office and arrested last March Last month  prosecutors asked a Seoul court to sentence Ms  Park to 30 years in prison on charges of collecting or demanding  21 million in bribes from big businesses  A three judge panel is scheduled to announce its ruling on Ms  Park on April 6 In the wake of Ms  Park s impeachment  critics attributed the recurring corruption scandals at the center of political power in South Korea to what they called the unbridled power of its  imperial presidency   On Thursday  Mr  Moon s government unveiled a bill to revise the Constitution to curtail presidential power In his proposed constitutional revision  Mr  Moon suggested that the current  single five year presidential term be replaced with a four year term and that the incumbent leader be allowed to seek another term  But Mr  Moon cannot benefit from the proposed revision and cannot seek re election The proposed revision deprives the president of the right to name the chief of the country s Constitutional Court  handing that decision over to the court s justices  It also reduced the president s power in appointing commissioners of the government watchdog Board of Audit and Inspection  It also curtailed the president s power to grant special pardons  which critics said has long been abused to free business tycoons convicted of bribery and other white color crimes But Mr  Moon will find it hard to pass his bill through Parliament  His governing party has only 121 seats there  well short of the 195 votes needed for a constitutional revision  Even if the bill is approved by lawmakers  it is also subject to referendum 
WASHINGTON   For Elliott Broidy  Donald J  Trump s presidential campaign represented an unparalleled political and business opportunity An investor and defense contractor  Mr  Broidy became a top fund raiser for Mr  Trump s campaign when most elite Republican donors were keeping their distance  and Mr  Trump in turn overlooked the lingering whiff of scandal from Mr  Broidy s 2009 guilty plea in a pension fund bribery case After Mr  Trump s election  Mr  Broidy quickly capitalized  marketing his Trump connections to politicians and governments around the world  including some with unsavory records  according to interviews and documents obtained by The New York Times  Mr  Broidy suggested to clients and prospective customers of his Virginia based defense contracting company  Circinus  that he could broker meetings with Mr  Trump  his administration and congressional allies Mr  Broidy s ability to leverage his political connections to boost his business illuminates how Mr  Trump s unorthodox approach to governing has spawned a new breed of access peddling in the swamp he vowed to drain Mr  Broidy offered tickets to V I P  inauguration events  including a candlelight dinner attended by Mr  Trump  to a Congolese strongman accused of funding a lavish lifestyle with public resources  He helped arrange a meeting with Republican senators and offered a trip to Mar a Lago  the president s private Florida resort  for an Angolan politician  And he arranged an invitation to a party at Mr  Trump s Washington hotel for a Romanian parliamentarian facing corruption charges  who posted a photograph with the president on Facebook This type of access has value on the international stage  where the perception of support from an American president   or even a photo with one   can benefit foreign leaders back home Mr  Broidy was open about his business interests  but the administration made no effort to curtail his offers of access to clients or prospective clients Yet Mr  Broidy was so aggressive  some associates said  that they warned him to tone down his approach for fear that he might run afoul of the president  clients or American lobbying and anti corruption laws As with so many other political conventions  Mr  Trump has upended the traditional system of access to the president  among the most prized chits in Washington  That is partly because of lax vetting that has allowed largely unfettered access to Mr  Trump and his White House by loyalists  friends and hangers on with their own policy agendas or business interests But it is also because few of Washington s established lobbyists have close connections to the president  In their place  a new class of insider has emerged  able to lobby the president directly on behalf of clients or business partners  an uncommon opportunity in prior administrations  when lobbyists focused on winning support from lawmakers or regulators In a statement  Mr  Broidy said the success of his company reflected his recruitment of  the best people  including a number of former flag officers   not his political connections   The idea that our success derives from activities around last year s presidential inauguration is not only misplaced but insulting to the careers and capabilities of our highly trained and decorated veterans   he said Mr  Broidy  60  in some ways personifies this new breed of Trump insider  A lifelong Los Angeles resident who worked as an accountant before making a fortune as an investor  Mr  Broidy grew more interested in politics after the Sept  11 attacks  which shaped his hawkish approach to foreign policy and concern for the defense of Israel  In 2005  he was appointed to a federal homeland security advisory panel Mr  Broidy pleaded guilty in 2009 to giving nearly  1 million in illegal gifts to New York state officials to help his company land a  250 million contract with the state s public pension fund  He paid  18 million in restitution and avoided jail time As he worked to rebuild his bank account and reputation  he expanded his business interests in the defense and security industry  starting a company called Threat Deterrence in 2013 and purchasing Circinus in July 2015 Mr  Broidy initially supported Senator Ted Cruz of Texas for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016  embracing Mr  Trump only after Mr  Cruz dropped out His business took off after Mr  Trump s election  Circinus has won lucrative work from around the world  including contracts worth more than  200 million to do defense work for the United Arab Emirates  And Mr  Broidy openly promoted Circinus s work in meetings with Mr  Trump and other Republican officials  according to documents and interviews But Mr  Broidy faces a sudden backlash One of his business partners  George Nader   is cooperating with the special counsel  whose investigators have asked about Mr  Nader s contacts with top Trump administration officials as well as his possible role in funneling money from the U A E  to Mr  Trump s political efforts  according to people familiar with the inquiry Mr  Nader helped Circinus gain access to U A E  s crown prince  while also using Mr  Broidy as a conduit  to shape Trump administration policy toward the Persian Gulf on behalf of the U A E  and Saudi Arabia  both American allies  Mr  Broidy  in turn  appears to have helped Mr  Nader get his photograph taken with Mr  Trump at a fund raiser  over the unspecified objections of the Secret Service  Mr  Nader has been convicted on charges related to child pornography and sexual abuse of minors Hundreds of pages of Mr  Broidy s emails  proposals and contracts were provided to The Times by an anonymous group critical of Mr  Broidy s advocacy of American foreign policies in the Middle East  Mr  Broidy s representatives say they have proof that the documents were stolen by hackers working for Qatar in retaliation for his efforts to rally opposition in Washington to Qatar  a regional nemesis of the Saudis and the Emiratis  The Qataris dismiss this charge The documents reveal that Mr  Broidy  a vice chairman of the finance committee for Mr  Trump s inauguration  arranged invitations to parties celebrating the event for foreign leaders with whom Circinus worked to sign contracts that could have been worth hundreds of millions of dollars  Mr  Broidy in some cases presented the invitations in a manner that suggested they were linked to their countries  willingness to do business with Circinus For instance  Mr  Broidy invited Denis Sassou Nguesso  the longtime president of the Republic of Congo  to a handful of inauguration week events  including the candlelight dinner featuring Mr  Trump  Vice President Mike Pence and their wives   Your name has been submitted and approved   Mr  Broidy wrote to Mr  Sassou Nguesso in a note on Broidy Capital Management letterhead  Mr  Broidy stressed that the invitation was from Mr  Broidy and  is not coming from the Joint Congressional Committee  on Inaugural Ceremonies  which oversees the swearing in and a luncheon at the Capitol The day after the letter was dated  Mr  Broidy asked his team at Circinus to prepare an invoice for  2 million to Mr  Sassou Nguesso s office for  military capabilities assessment and review services   according to emails and documents People close to Mr  Broidy said no invoice was sent and Circinus never worked for the Congolese government  Mr  Sassou Nguesso declined the invitation to the inauguration festivities  they said Donors to previous inaugurations were also able to invite foreign heads of state to events as their guests  a spokesman for Mr  Broidy noted Two officials from Romania  another prospective Circinus client  met Mr  Trump at a private party to which Mr  Broidy invited them during inauguration week at the Trump International Hotel near the White House  Liviu Dragnea  a parliamentary leader who runs the Social Democratic Party  called for closer ties between Romania and the United States  prompting Mr  Trump to declare   We will make it happen  Romania is important for us   according to Mr  Dragnea s Facebook post  reported by McClatchy At the time  Mr  Dragnea faced corruption charges  which he continues to fight  But for months after the inauguration  Circinus continued pitching his government partly on the access it could provide to Mr  Trump  according to a person who works with the Romanian government and was briefed on the solicitation Circinus has yet to receive contracts from Romania  people close to Mr  Broidy said  The company entered into an agreement last month with a Romanian government owned defense company that appears to give it the inside track for contracts valued at more than  200 million  according to Romanian news media and people familiar with the contracting process Similarly  in a letter dated Jan  3  2017  and emailed to top Angolan government officials  Mr  Broidy indicated that he was also sending both an invitation to the inauguration festivities and a proposal for Circinus to provide security services for Angola  In one version of the proposal  the company sought nearly  64 million over five years   With numerous preparations ahead  we request that you kindly return the executed document no later than January 9  2017   Mr  Broidy wrote in the letter to João Lourenço  then the Angolan defense minister  and another Angolan official Three days before inauguration  the Angolans submitted a  6 million payment to Circinus  which people close to Mr  Broidy say was  2 million less than the Angolans had agreed to pay  That same day  the Angolans and Mr  Broidy met on Capitol Hill with senators including Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin  both Republicans  encounters arranged by Mr  Broidy and his team About one month later  Mr  Broidy again wrote to Mr  Lourenço  discussing plans for him  to be joining us at Mira Largo    an apparent reference to Mar a Lago  where Mr  Broidy is a member and has been spotted introducing guests to the president    this coming weekend   Many preparations have been made in advance of your visit  including additional meetings at the Capitol and the Department of Treasury   Mr  Broidy wrote He went on to remind Mr  Lourenço that Angola was past due on  the balance of the payment  for Circinus s services   Please make this payment immediately   he wrote Not long after Mr  Lourenço was inaugurated as president of Angola in September  Mr  Broidy wrote again to congratulate him and offer to help set up meetings with Mr  Trump and Mr  Pence   Before the formalities which would naturally be in order between our governments  I am able to assess and advise in this matter  and would be delighted to help foster such closer relation between Luanda and Washington   Mr  Broidy wrote  referring to the Angolan capital Mr  Lourenço did not come to Mar a Lago and never responded to the letters  according to people close to Mr  Broidy  Circinus never collected any additional funds from Angola beyond the initial  6 million payment  they said Mr  Broidy emphasizes to potential clients how his connections to Mr  Trump could benefit them  according to several people who have worked with him or heard his pitches  He was mentioning that he has political connections  and it could be helpful   said Eymen Errais  a counselor to the Tunisian Ministry of Development  Investment and International Cooperation Mr  Errais and the department s minister  Fadhel Abdelkefi  met with Mr  Broidy and Circinus executives in Tunisia a few weeks after Mr  Trump s election  Circinus sought a contract to build an open source intelligence center for the Tunisian government  a person familiar with the meeting said  but Mr  Abdelkefi s ministry instead sought to persuade Mr  Broidy to invest in the Tunisian hospitality industry Nonetheless  in an email to Mr  Abdelkefi just after the meeting  Mr  Broidy vowed that the center  would be an extremely useful and effective tool for your government  and again emphasized his connection to Mr  Trump  He characterized the incoming administration as  an unprecedented opportunity  in that the House  Senate and executive branch of our government are all under Republican control for the first time in 10 years  Circinus prepared a proposal for a five year contract totaling  80 million for the Tunisian work  But Mr  Errais said the Tunisians decided not to do business with Circinus   A connection with Trump   how would that help us for security   he said A person close to Mr  Broidy said he discussed the Republicans  control of Congress and the White House to suggest that the American government might increase spending on counterterrorism Mr  Broidy s allies say he has never hidden the overlap between his business interests and his political activity  In a memorandum about an October Oval Office meeting  for example  Mr  Broidy wrote that he had volunteered to Mr  Trump that his company was seeking a contract from the United Arab Emirates and had tried to arrange a private meeting for the president to discuss the matter with their leader  Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed But as scrutiny has mounted around Mr  Broidy  Republican officials signaled that he would be a distraction at a high dollar fund raiser with Mr  Trump this month in Los Angeles  Mr  Broidy helped plan it and was listed as a co host After conversations with Ronna McDaniel  the chairwoman of the Republican National Committee  he volunteered not to attend  according to people briefed on the situation The dinner and round table with the president proceeded without him 
MOSCOW    The Latest on the poisoning of a former Russian spy in Britain  all times local  11 15 p m A spokeswoman for the Russian Foreign Ministry says Britain s failure to track down the source of a nerve agent used to poison a Russian ex spy shows that the accusations against Russia have been based merely on baseless suspicion Maria Zakharova cited the head of the British defense laboratory s acknowledgement that scientists didn t identify the origin of the nerve agent used to poison former double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter in England on March 4 In a mocking statement posted

former Russian spy could have been created anywhere Igor Rybalchenko  the head of chemical lab at the Russian Defense Ministry s scientific center chemical laboratory  said Tuesday that  it s not a problem  for a well equipped lab anywhere in the world to synthesize the Soviet designed agent dubbed Novichok in the West He told state funded RT television that all precursors for making the agent

the accusations Russia vehemently denied  Both the West and Russia have expelled over 150 envoys each in the dispute Putin said the type of the nerve agent used in the March 4 poisoning could be made in some 20 nations    9 40 p m Russia s envoy to the European Union says British accusations of Russian involvement in the poisoning of an ex Russian spy could have been an attempt to distract public attention from Britain s troubled exit from the EU Vladimir Chizhov said Tuesday  this distractive maneuver could have been aimed at the British society  which has remained split after the 2016 Brexit referendum  Britain has accused Russia of involvement in the March 4 nerve agent attack on former double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter  the accusations Russia has vehemently denied Moscow alleged that British intelligence agencies could have been behind the poisoning Chizhov says  Russia clearly had no motive  to attack Skripal  who was convicted of spying for Britain but freed in a

its investigation  The official did not divulge those details  but said Russian involvement in the attack is the only  plausible explanation  The official told The Associated Press that France would not respond to Russia until Moscow answers questions posed by Britain s government on March 12  Britain at the time asked the Russian ambassador to say whether the attack was carried out by the

that was actually manufactured  Britain says the Skripals were poisoned with a Soviet developed nerve agent  and that the Russian state must be behind the attack Russia denies responsibility and has suggested the poison may have come from Britain Aitkenhead said Tuesday that the attack with a highly toxic Novichok nerve agent was  probably only within the capabilities of a state actor  He says there is  no way  the nerve agent could have come from the high security Porton Down facility    5 50 p m The global chemical weapons control body will hold an emergency meeting to discuss the

RIO DE JANEIRO   A new Netflix series about a sprawling corruption investigation has muscled its way into Brazil s heated politics  outraging supporters of a leftist former president who is trying to make a comeback and stirring debate about how closely a docudrama should adhere to the facts The series   The Mechanism   has drawn heat since it was released on March 23  Critics say its inaccuracies are unfair to a former president  Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva  who is the leading candidate in the polls for the election this fall  Others see in the show a more or less fair  if depressing  depiction of an intricate investigation that has so far seen more than 100 people convicted  including senior political figures like Mr  da Silva Still others say the publicity   however negative   has only been a boon for Netflix  and lament the frivolity of talking about a television show instead of poverty  violence  environmental conflicts and the myriad other challenges that face Brazil  Latin America s most populous nation The debate has been fierce Paulo Roberto Pires  a left leaning columnist at the newsmagazine Época  called the series misleading  adding that it reduced complex political  historical and social issues to the fight against corruption Antonia Pellegrino  a feminist activist who has a blog at the newspaper Folha de São Paulo  said the series amounted to a  condemnation of representative democracy  Mr  da Silva  known universally as Lula  has not directly commented on the series  but his ally and successor as president  Dilma Rousseff  wrote a post on Facebook listing inaccuracies   Netflix s board doesn t know what they got into   she said last Monday  a comment that some commentators interpreted as an implicit threat   I think this is very serious for them  The show s creator  José Padilha  a Brazilian based in Los Angeles  said the furor had only benefited the series   I think Lula and Dilma are helping us a lot with the marketing of the series   he said with a laugh Mr  Padilha  who also created the Netflix series  Narcos   about a Colombia drug kingpin  noted the disclaimer before each episode  which says that the series is  loosely based on actual events   The Mechanism  dramatizes a corruption investigation   known by its police code name  Operation Car Wash   that has now roiled Brazilian politics for more than four years  Three successive presidents have been implicated  Mr  da Silva  who was convicted of corruption and money laundering  Ms  Rousseff  who was impeached and removed from office over unrelated charges of violating budgetary rules but also faced criminal investigations  and the incumbent  Michel Temer  who has faced charges and remains under investigation A main source of the controversy is a scene in the fifth episode of the series  in which a character based on Mr  da Silva talks about efforts to block the investigation and speaks of a need to  stop this bleeding  In reality  the quotation was uttered in a notorious 2016 secret recording of Senator Romero Jucá  a onetime ally of Mr  da Silva s who by then had become a political opponent and later backed the impeachment of Ms  Rousseff Ms  Rousseff pointed to other liberties the series took with the facts One money laundering scandal referred to in the series occurred when an opposition party   not Mr  da Silva s Workers  Party   was in charge Ms  Rousseff also complained that the main money launderer  Alberto Youssef  is depicted in a scene inside her campaign committee during the 2014 elections  when in reality he was already in jail by then The series takes a largely dim view of Mr  da Silva  Prosecutors have portrayed him as an embodiment of corruption  while Mr  da Silva says that the investigations were driven by rivals who resented his redistributive economic policies Mr  da Silva wants to stand as a candidate in the October election  although he was convicted last year of corruption and still faces charges in six other corruption cases  He has appealed  On Wednesday  the Supreme Court is expected to rule on whether he should be jailed imminently The title of the Netflix series comes from Mr  Padilha s theory  expounded in columns  that only the corrupt can get ahead in Brazilian politics Some critics have called him a reactionary  a charge he denies  he has made donations to a smaller left wing party that has not been embroiled in the corruption investigation On the left  the response to Mr  Padilha s show has been outrage  Pablo Villaça  a left leaning film critic  called the release of the series  extremely irresponsible   After watching two episodes  he announced on his Twitter account that he was canceling his subscription to Netflix More conservative voters saw it differently   I think Padilha wanted to give a general overview of corruption in Brazil   said Adelaide Oliveira  a spokeswoman for Vem Pra Rua  or Take to the Streets  an activist movement that opposes corruption and big government   I think he did it well  though reality is richer  In a speech during a rally last Wednesday  Mr  da Silva said he might sue Netflix   If we need to  we will sue him in Brazil  in the United States  in Europe  anywhere   he said  His lawyers told Netflix last year about his concerns with distortions in the series  the company did not respond to requests for comment about this article  Nearly half of Brazilians lack home internet access  limiting the reach of the series here In an interview  Mr  Padilha played down the significance of the misquote attributed to Mr  da Silva  saying the phrase  doesn t belong to anybody  He added   We have a show where we show that those politicians stole billions of dollars  and the problem they have is with a line  Fábio Vasconcellos  a political scientist at the State University of Rio de Janeiro  said he did not think  The Mechanism  would have much electoral impact   The series fuels already existent points of view   he said   A lot of what is in there is very well known to Brazilians  But the series has found some fans among Brazilians   People are criticizing it  but those people were the leaders of the government  of course they were involved   said Gabriel Coelho  a 29 year old cook in Rio de Janeiro   We only need to find out to what extent  Others refused to give it an audience   It s bad for Brazil  because it s a series that arrives in people s homes with just with one side of the story   said Paula Abreu  a 31 year old teacher  also from Rio de Janeiro   It s concerning because it intensifies hate  It is likely that this will not be the last time Netflix wades into politically treacherous waters in Latin America In neighboring Argentina  expectations are high for a mini series that Netflix has reportedly begun producing about the mysterious death of a prosecutor  Alberto Nisman  who was investigating the 1994 bombing of a Jewish community center Mr  Nisman was found dead in his bathroom with a gunshot wound to the head in 2015  hours before he was scheduled to testify in Congress about an explosive accusation that the president at the time  Cristina Fernández de Kirchner  and several members of her administration conspired to cover up what the accusers claim said was Iran s role in the attack The death  which a recent forensic report concluded was a murder  has divided Argentina and continues to be enveloped in mystery 
To hear the wine marketers tell it  every estate picks its grapes at the point of perfect ripeness  But does such a moment really exist As with so much in wine  what is in fact subjective is often presented as objective  Just as no perfect moment exists to open a bottle  and no optimum length exists for aging a wine  no particular set of conditions defines perfect ripeness  It all depends on the intent and taste of the grower and producer  along with vintage conditions  the site and perhaps a bit of luck The motives of the marketer and the desires of the consumer inevitably clash  Here at Wine School  we love wine  but are inherently skeptical about anybody in the trade who claims to have done anything at the one right moment  Just as in journalism  in which generations of reporters have been taught never to assume a thing   not even that their mothers love them   such claims should invite doubt I was thinking about ripeness over the last few weeks as we tasted several examples of Rosso di Montalcino  the younger sibling of the renowned Brunello di Montalcino  Each of the three bottles I suggested  from the 2015 vintage  seemed to exhibit a different degree of ripeness  Each  depending on the taste of the consumer  could be considered to have been made with properly ripened grapes These were the three Rosso di Montalcinos  La Torre  Le Potazzine and Lisini Each wine  as is required of all Rossos and Brunellos di Montalcino  was made entirely of the sangiovese grape  At times this rule has caused frustration among some Montalcino producers  who 20 years ago were seeking to soften sangiovese s naturally high acidity  darken its characteristically ruby color and relax its often angular austerity by adding international grapes like merlot  syrah or cabernet sauvignon Those efforts outside the rules came crashing down in scandal in 2008  Since then  Montalcino producers have  outwardly at least  reconciled themselves to the sangiovese rule and have turned to legal  if not always palatable  methods to achieve their aims Among those methods  they might age the wine in small barrels of new oak  which can intensify the color  Frankly  I ve never understood the fixation with dark colors in red wine  Some of the greatest Burgundy  Barolo and sangiovese based wines are fairly pale You would think that producers would aim for pale rather than dark  But they have heard from consultants that consumers prefer darker reds  The nonsense apparently flows in both directions Producers might also try to address some of their concerns in the vineyard  through how they manage the canopy of leaves  which can be arranged not only to allow a steady movement of air  reducing susceptibility to diseases  but also to shade grapes from the sun or to permit more direct sunlight  affecting the rate at which the grapes ripen  They can vary the yield of the vines  through pruning or thinning grape bunches  which can ultimately achieve greater or lesser intensity in the wines  And they can manipulate aromas  flavors and textures simply by deciding when to pick the grapes I m happy to say that I do not think that any of these three producers is troubled by the natural characteristics of sangiovese  one of the world s great grapes  Each of these wines showed ample evidence of sangiovese s vibrant acidity  They were also naturally tannic  meaning that they demonstrated the true tannins of the grape rather than the bitter tannins that can be imparted by new oak barrels  And they showed the true flavors and character of sangiovese  unmitigated by new oak But each bottle seemed to adhere to a different definition of ripeness  It seemed to me  judging strictly by the wine  that the Rosso from La Torre had been picked the earliest  Its dominant characteristics were freshness and purity of aromas and flavors I loved its liveliness  its dusty  earthy red fruit flavors with a touch of minerality and bitterness  In current wine parlance  sommeliers might refer to this wine as  crunchy   like biting into a juicy apple in which the sweetness and the acidity were precisely balanced At the other end of this admittedly narrow spectrum  the Lisini Rosso seems much riper  The fruit is a little bit sweeter  as if you are not biting into a piece of fresh fruit but maybe dipping into some compote  It s also more tannic  as if the juice of the freshly crushed grapes had macerated longer with the tannin bearing skins  or perhaps the grape skins were a bit thicker and contained more tannic compounds I would not call these grapes overripe by any means  Wines made from overripe grapes would be overtly jammy  with less acidity  They can feel thick  give an impression of sweetness and lack zest  Some people enjoy them  but not me The Rosso from Le Potazzine seemed to stake out a middle ground  It offered the acid snap of the La Torre but was even more tannic than the Lisini  The fruit was not sweet  but the flavors seemed darker  with almost a licorice tinge All of these wines improved with food  fettuccine Bolognese  but Le Potazzine really blossomed  melding beautifully with the rich  meaty sauce Rosso  as I said  is the younger sibling of Brunello di Montalcino  What s the difference Brunello is aged longer  for one thing  four years before it can be released  of which a minimum of two must be in casks  Rosso need only be aged one year before release Producers often choose to use the fruit from younger vines or from lesser sites in their Rosso  or grapes that simply did not fit into the blend of their Brunello Though marketers often try to capitalize on the fame of Brunello by referring to Rossos as  Baby Brunellos   it s better to accept Rossos on their own terms  They are lighter  fresher  more easygoing wines  more accessible without aging  though some will evolve and improve over the years  They generally do not require contemplation  and what s wrong with that  Deliciousness is its own reward I have noticed among some consumers a tendency to dismiss Montalcino wines in general as somehow not being authentic enough  much in the same way that many have sneered at Bordeaux  Please  Like any wine region in the world  Montalcino has its share of poseurs  manipulators and fabricators  But the good wines are beautiful and should not be missed Readers seemed to enjoy these wines  although several remembered days when they cost  10  not  30  Of course  we could have that conversation about a lot of wines  One reader  VSB in San Francisco  who drank the 2015 La Torre  seemed surprised about one thing  though  Oddly  tasted better with the food than by itself   he said Welcome to Italy  where wine is especially constructed to go with food  On their own  most traditionally made Italian reds can taste acidic  tannic and bitter without food  They are meant for the table  not as cocktails or aperitifs  In Italy  that s what sparkling wine is for While I seized on these three wines for the opportunity they offered to talk about ripeness  other factors also play a role  Soils will influence the flavors  those grapes coming from heavier clay sites will be fruitier and denser  while those from sites with more limestone may be more aromatic and less fruity  The altitude of the vineyard plays a role  as does luck By that I mean that some things are out of a grower s control  A crew of grape pickers might not be available at the moment a grower wants to harvest  That unexpected delay can result in riper grapes than envisioned But the most important factor is intent  Each of these wines  I believed  represented the intent of the producer  and each differed  So when you hear the next marketer crowing about the  perfect ripeness  of the grapes  simply know that the marketers should add a clause to their claim   in our opinion  Follow NYT Food on Facebook  Instagram  Twitter and Pinterest  Get regular updates from NYT Cooking  with recipe suggestions  cooking

LIMA  Peru   Peru s first vice president  a low profile engineer who also doubles as his country s ambassador to Canada  was poised on Thursday to assume power after the resignation of President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski in a corruption scandal Mr  Kuczynski s abrupt resignation on Wednesday  following the release of recordings that showed key allies trying to buy the support of opposition lawmakers  convulsed this Andean nation  although many Peruvians were not surprised  He had been severely weakened by a scandal that had built for many months  and had narrowly avoided a previous impeachment effort  in December Peru s Congress debated Thursday night whether to accept the resignation or to proceed with formal impeachment  which would be a particularly humiliating turn for Mr  Kuczynski  79  an economist who worked for international institutions for many years A vote was set for Friday  A number of representatives said they would not accept Mr  Kuczynski s resignation unless he rewrote his letter offering to step down  In the letter  Mr  Kuczynski admitted no wrongdoing and accused Congress of  hindrances and attacks  Either way  the first vice president  Martín Vizcarra  55  is expected to take power  I m indignant with the current situation  like the majority of Peruvians  but I m convinced that together we will show once again that we can move forward   Mr  Vizcarra  wrote on Twitter Mr  Vizcarra served one term as governor of his home region of Moquegua in southern Peru  which includes parts of the desert coast and the Andes  but did not seek re election  Instead  two years later  he joined Mr  Kuczynski s ticket  as his first vice president  During the campaign  Mr  Kuczynski called Mr  Vizcarra one of his two  insurance policies  in case he died in office He was also a part of Mr  Kuczynski s first cabinet  becoming minister of transportation and communications  but was forced to resign after opposition lawmakers questioned his plans for a planned airport in Cusco  Peru s most important tourist destination  After his resignation  he was appointed ambassador to Canada Even as Mr  Vizcarra was being summoned home from Ottawa  the scandal over Mr  Kuczynski continued to shake Peru  On Thursday  a Peruvian judge said he would consider a request to bar Mr  Kuczynski from leaving the country if the opposition controlled Congress decided to accept the resignation  which would end his presidential immunity and make him vulnerable to prosecution Peru has a long history of presidents entangled in corruption scandals Alberto K  Fujimori diverted tens of millions in government funds in the 1990s to buy politicians and journalists  and until recently was imprisoned in Peru  Alejandro Toledo  was accused of receiving a  20 million bribe in the early 2000s from the construction giant Odebrecht  and Ollanta Humala and his wife were placed in pretrial detention over allegations of laundering  3 million in Odebrecht funds to support his 2011 presidential campaign It was Mr  Fujimori who  after complaining that Congress did not let him govern  helped establish the current political system  He sent tanks to shut down Parliament in 1992  and later blessed a Constitution that established a unicameral Parliament  doing away with the Senate  A system of government requires checks and balances  and we lost those with our current Constitution   said César Landa  a constitutional lawyer   Having a single chamber of Congress is not part of our democratic tradition  In 2016  Mr  Kuczynski narrowly defeated Mr  Fujimori s daughter Keiko  but her right wing party  the Popular Force  went on to dominate Congress  The president s party won only a small minority  Mr  Kuczynski was politically isolated and a virtual hostage to the demands of Keiko Fujimori s sector   said Cynthia McClintock  a professor of political science at George Washington University Mr  Kuczynski s weak government tested the limits of Peru s fragile democratic institutions  During his 19 months in office  Congress either fired or forced the resignation of three ministers and at one point it fired the entire cabinet  and lawmakers tried to fire the attorney general and four judges of the Constitutional Court  Twice it accused Mr  Kuczynski of  permanent moral incapacity  and each time scheduled a vote to determine his fate  We are returning to a dictatorship  but this time from Congress   Mercedes Aráoz  who had been Mr  Kuczynski s prime minister  said this month Mr  Kuczynski s enemies denied that Congress had overstepped its powers  I think we have strengthened democracy   said Ursula Letona  a lawmaker with the Popular Force   We haven t broken the entire government   we ve simply paved the way for an orderly and constitutional presidential transition  Whether Mr  Vizcarra will be given more room to govern is still an open question   Personally  I m very optimistic   said Carlos Tubino  also a Popular Force congressman There are several proposals that would reinstate the Senate  which would make it harder for a single group to have as much legislative power  But they could face an uphill battle  The people don t want two chambers of Congress because it means extra spending   said Ms  Letona  who runs the congressional committee in charge of constitutional amendments   And we are not a government branch that is particularly loved  Mr  Kuczynski s political fortunes were closely associated with the Fujimori family He courted Mr  Fujimori s son Kenji  a congressman openly at odds with his older sister Keiko  After Kenji Fujimori split with the Popular Force last December to create a faction that saved Mr  Kuczynski from impeachment  the president issued a medical pardon to Alberto Fujimori that allowed him to get out of prison  Mr  Kuczynski then brought Kenji Fujimori aboard the presidential plane  and took at least three lawmakers from the faction on trips When a second impeachment motion backed by the Popular Force threatened Mr  Kuczynski this month  he sought out Kenji for support   No doubt he s going to support me   he told the local newspaper The Trome Then old style Fujimori tactics seemed to emerge An ally of Keiko Fujimori s sought meetings with Kenji Fujimori and his allies  claiming to be considering switching sides to back the president  He secretly recorded Mr  Fujimori and his aides bragging that those who supported Mr  Kuczynski reaped big rewards Ms  Fujimori s party released the covert videos on Tuesday  dealing a final blow to Mr  Kuczynski and potentially ending her brother s political aspirations  Congress is considering expelling Kenji Fujimori The arm twisting and secret surveillance were reminiscent of the tactics used by Alberto Fujimori s top adviser  Vladimiro Montesinos  a former spy chief who became infamous for filming hundreds of meetings where he handed out bribes  building pyramids of cash as he carried out negotiations  It was one of Mr  Montesinos s videos that set off the downfall of Mr  Fujimori in 2000 This month  Mr  Montesinos weighed in on the family fight   In the 1990s  I used to speak more with Keiko Fujimori  not so much with Kenji   Mr  Montesinos said on Facebook through his lawyer   So  if I have left a mark on anyone  it s on Keiko  
VIENNA   Four haunting musical notes have enveloped central Vienna s Heldenplatz  or Heroes  Square  An invisible artwork s voice like sounds swirl down from a former Hapsburg palace  and float across from two buildings on the other side of the huge public space  It s so interesting in this busy square  so subtle   said Peter Larndorfer  34  a passer by  shortly after the work was unveiled on Monday   But maybe it s just what we need on such fraught ground  For the next eight months  the Scottish artist Susan Philipsz is using the eerie sound of fingers rubbed on water filled glasses to remind visitors of Nazi Germany s annexation of Austria 80 years ago  On March 12  1938  Austrians cheered German troops as they marched into the country  and three days later  tens of thousands on the Heldenplatz saluted Hitler as he addressed them from the palace balcony The Nazis  propaganda footage of Hitler s triumphant speech to jubilant Austrians is infamous  and today is accepted as a realistic portrayal of the public mood at the time  But it took the country until the early 1990s to officially concede that Austrians had been willing perpetrators of Nazi crimes  after the war  the country was often spoken of as Hitler s  first victim   For many  the Anschluss   as the incorporation of Austria into the Third Reich is known  remains a tricky subject  The first transport to Dachau took place two weeks after the speech   said Ms  Philipsz  who won the Turner Prize in 2010  on her way to a final sound check last Friday   I wanted to remember all those who had disappeared  to give them a voice   she said  adding   They say the sound of glass is most like the sound of the human voice   The Voices  was commissioned by the House of History Austria  a planned museum that will tell the history of Austrian democracy  and its interruptions   It is scheduled to open in November  around the centennial of the Austrian republic s birth from the horrors of World War I and the collapse of the Hapsburg Empire Monika Sommer  the museum s director  said the  subtlety and fragility  of  The Voices  matched how her museum wanted to help the country look at the past   We don t want any finger pointing   she said   We want to take a sober look at Austrian history  But she added the task of doing that was getting harder   We are seeing anti Semitism  and xenophobia more generally  becoming more widespread again  In December  the conservative People s Party and the far right Freedom Party formed a government in Austria  They were elected on an anti immigration agenda in reaction to Europe s refugee crisis  The parties  coalition agreement officially states that Austria was a perpetrator of Nazi crimes  and decries anti Semitism  But a Freedom Party politician quit in February in a scandal over an anti Semitic songbook used by his old university fraternity  and Facebook followers of the party s leader  Heinz Christian Strache  recently criticized him for speaking about Austria s complicity in Nazi rule Pointedly  the government of Chancellor Sebastian Kurz has reserved judgment about whether it will keep financing the House of History   initiated by the left leaning Social Democratic Party after decades of debate   when the museum s current budget runs out in December 2019   The ongoing discussion about the future of the museum shows it s still difficult to talk about and reappraise the country s history   said Ms  Sommer  Susan s art isn t overtly political  but that doesn t mean it s unpolitical   said Kasper König  a German museum director and curator who advised the museum about the installation  Ms  Philipsz said she never expressly set out to be a public artist  Having sung in a choir as a child and trained as a sculptor  she said she was interested  in what happens when you project sound into a space    what happens to the person projecting  the space  and the listener Some of her most notable works   like  Lowlands   placed under bridges in Glasgow in 2010   Study for Strings  at the main railway station in Kassel  Germany  as part of the 2012 Documenta art exhibition  and  War Damaged Musical Instruments  at London s Tate Britain in 2015 2016   have used voices or instruments to evoke a sense of loss and separation in public spaces  Your feelings of longing or melancholy are often battling ambient sounds   she said   And it s exactly through these ambient sounds that you become very aware of where you are and who you re beside  Ms  Philipsz praised the museum for dealing with the behind the scenes politics and letting her get on with her work  She first visited the site last October and quickly struck upon the lead crystal motif  in part thanks to some imposing chandeliers in the palace  Mozart spent a lot of time in Vienna and composed works for the lead crystal glass harmonica   Ms  Philipsz said  Radio sets had crystal elements in the 1930s  and the radio was a vital propaganda tool for Hitler   And  of course  there was Kristallnacht   Ms  Philipsz said  referring to the night of Nov  9  1938  when synagogues and Jewish businesses in Germany and Austria were ransacked  It was an eruption of hate she also wants  The Voices  to memorialize  The museum wanted a work of art to make the public reflect on Hitler s speech from the balcony  but was wary of putting a sculpture there  Commissioning a sound artist solved the problem  but the museum s original idea of placing all of the speakers where Hitler spoke did not work for Ms  Philipsz  as it kept too much attention on the balcony  That felt wrong   I didn t want this to be about Hitler  but about the voices of all the people who had gathered there over the decades   So she also had speakers placed on the other side of the square  This  however  meant  The Voices  could be heard only for 10 minutes twice a day  at 12 30 p m  and 6 30 p m  in deference to the neighbors  I personally find the work a bit underwhelming  but it would have been unimaginable in Austria until the 1990s   said G  Daniel Cohen  a historian from Rice University in Houston currently in Vienna to write a book about attitudes toward Jews in postwar Europe   Such attempts at national reflection have at the very least forced the far right to accept the existence of a taboo against anti Semitism and Holocaust denial  On Tuesday lunchtime  around 50 people were listening by the statue of Archduke Karl  one of the heroes the Heldenplatz honors   It is a stirring experience   said Dagmar Friedl Preyer  57  a social worker  who had come to the square to hear the work   You see the balcony and think of all that  Anschluss  delirium  the sound makes all that well up   Her friend Josef Huber  a retiree  said he thought many Austrians would come to hear  The Voices    The problem  of course  is those who want nothing to do with any of this   they won t come to listen

Spotify  the streaming music service  is eschewing the traditional initial public offering for a direct listing and is taking its pitch directly to retail investors  streaming its presentation on its website Thursday Here are a few takeaways Why a direct listing  The post I P O  lockup period  during which employees can t sell shares   We have allowed shareholders and employees to buy and sell stock for years   said Daniel Ek  Spotify s C E O and founder  said   That shouldn t stop just because our stock is more widely owned  The company is also well capitalized with positive free cash flow

pay rise  How did that happen The numbers  Timothy J  Sloan s compensation for 2017 totaled  17 6 million  a 35 percent increase from the  13 million he earned in 2016  His stock award for 2017 was  15 million  a big jump from  10 5 million in 2016 Is the increase justified  given the bank s issues  Wells Fargo would no doubt point to the fact that Mr  Sloan decided to forgo a cash bonus in 2017  John G  Stumpf  a former C E O   got a  4 million cash bonus in 2015  for instance  Also  Mr  Sloan s stock award was set in February last year and reflects his promotion in 2016 to C E O  And if Wells Fargo slips up badly over the next three years  Mr  Sloan may not get the entire  15 million stock award How does Mr  Sloan s pay stack up against others  He is making less than the C E O  of Bank of America  Brian T  Moynihan  who made  21 8 million last year  But Mr  Sloan is making quite a bit more than the chief executives of large regional banks  US Bank s chief executive  Andrew Cecere  had 2017 compensation of  12 million But Mr  Sloan looks overpaid on a new metric that public companies must provide  This yardstick compares a C E O  s pay with that of the median employee s pay  Mr  Sloan s 2017 pay was 291 times that of Wells Fargo s median earner  That is above the 250 times for Mr  Moynihan  And Mr  Sloan s ratio is far in excess of Mr  Cecere s 205 times   Peter EavisOne of President Trump s most prominent supporters in the business world on Thursday said the United States would have the upper hand against China in a trade skirmish Peter Thiel  a technology entrepreneur with libertarian leanings  told the Economic Club of New York that the United States doesn t export enough to China to make it vulnerable to Chinese retaliation  If Mr  Trump imposed trade restrictions on Chinese goods  as he may in the coming weeks  China could do the same to United States exports  Mr  Thiel seemed unfazed by that   It s quite unclear where China can reciprocate because we are exporting so little   he said Mr  Thiel s views echo those of Mr  Trump The American exports to China are not small  They totaled  184 billion in the 12 months through the end of September 2017  That makes China the United States  fourth largest export market after the European Union  Canada and Mexico  The United States  however  imports far more from China than it exports  which means the deficit with China is far larger than it is with Mexico and the European Union   Peter EavisThe blood testing start up was once one of Silicon Valley s most lauded unicorns  But  the S

 Good Thursday  Here s what we re watching   Jamie Dimon chafes under liquidity rules   Mark Zuckerberg has disclosed more on how much Facebook user data may have been accessed   The White House is still talking tough on trade with China   Blackstone s infrastructure fund isn t doing so well Get this in your inbox each morning  Sign up here On Wall Street  there s been a running parlor game about whether Jamie Dimon  JPMorgan Chase s chief executive  would try to run for president in 2020  His annual letters  filled with commentary on U S  policy  have only increased the chatter  and this year s letter  released Thursday  is no different  It touches on everything from trade to immigration  While Mr  Dimon  who once called himself  barely a Democrat   says he plans to stay at the bank for the next five years  the question among political prognosticators is whether Mr  Dimon s policy views could ever find a home among voters in this politically polarized environment Mr  Dimon s sensible letter was seemingly supportive of some of President Trump s policies  while taking the opposing side on others  Mr  Dimon particularly applauded the corporate tax cut and deregulation efforts  On China trade  Mr  Dimon writes   It is not unreasonable for the United States to press ahead for more equivalency   and that  one of the administration s best arguments is that negotiation alone has not worked   However  he said he would like to see more cooperation with U S  allies on talks with China and added that the U S  should  revisit the Trans Pacific Partnership  On immigration  he called for tougher border control  writing   American citizens have the right to complain that we have not successfully protected our borders since the last immigration reform in 1986   He also said   People immigrating to this country should be taught American history  our language and our principles   At the same time  he also advocated for  a path to legal status and citizenship  for  Dreamers  and improving  merit based immigration  programs so that immigrants educated here can stay Mr  Dimon made a point of saying that part of the problems facing the country is that too many people are talking past each other  When people argue as if there are binary solutions  the argument is almost always wrong   he wrote  advocating that people try to look at all sides of a situation   I tell my liberal friends to read columnists like Arthur Brooks and George Will  And I tell my conservative friends to read writers like Tom Friedman  If Mr  Dimon were to run  he would likely have to do so as an independent  It is hard to see how liberal Democrats would embrace much of his deregulatory positions  And yet many of his positions   and especially some of his social positions not enunciated in his letter   may not be far right enough to capture the interest of Republicans Maybe the country needs someone in the middle  but history has not been kind to third party candidates   Andrew Ross SorkinJamie Dimon  in his annual letter to JPMorgan Chase s shareholders  had much to say about political issues like trade and immigration But he also addressed a policy area much closer to home   bank regulation  Mr  Dimon often has expressed skepticism about aspects of the banking overhaul that took place in the wake of the financial crisis  But his remarks on regulation arguably carry more weight now  Congress is closer to modifying the post crisis rules than at any point since Dodd Frank was signed into law in 2010  An important regulatory requirement Mr  Dimon criticized  therefore  might become a focus for those wanting to roll back the rules Mr  Dimon in this year s letter zeroed in on regulations that require banks to have a certain amount of liquidity  the financial term for access to cash or low risk assets that can be easily sold for cash In 2008  some large financial firms were crippled when customers  depositors and creditors withdrew their money  The Federal Reserve and taxpayers had to step in to support the banks  To help prevent a repeat of this  post crisis rules require that banks hold a certain amount of liquid assets to cover a theoretical level of outflows  Mr  Dimon is in favor of banks having more liquidity than before the crisis  but in the letter  released Thursday  he wrote Notably  legislation currently in Congress would tweak liquidity rules  If it passes  bankers may press for more loosening  And  as they have before  bank lobbyists may deploy Mr  Dimon s main argument here   that regulation can lead to less lending  But there are flaws in this line of attack  especially when it comes to liquidity rules First  a bank that lacks liquidity is in no position to lend  When a bank s creditors and customers fear it doesn t have enough cash in reserve  they will most likely withdraw their money  This not only deprives the bank of the money it needs to lend  it also sharply reduces its chance of survival  Or as Gregg Gelzinis of the left leaning Center for American Progress puts it   You won t be able to take this action if you fail  Perhaps more importantly  Mr  Dimon leaves out some crucial context  Congress designed the whole post crisis overhaul to ensure that banks have the funds on hand to lend during a downturn  Dodd Frank s architects saw that when banks stop lending  it makes a recession far worse  And that is one reason why banks now have much higher levels of capital  Regulators expect that they will use up some of that capital to keep lending through the economic tumult  This is why the Federal Reserve said after its last bank stress tests Andrew Gray  a JPMorgan spokesman  followed up with more material on Mr  Dimon s thinking on liquidity He re emphasized Mr  Dimon s point about having to tie up funds that could be used to make loans  Mr  Gray noted that a bank facing outflows would be expected to keep refilling its pool of liquid assets to be in compliance with a liquidity regulation  This would leave fewer funds for lending and making markets  Mr  Gray asserted He also addressed the argument that higher capital levels  not liquidity  will largely determine the extent to which banks will lend through a downturn  Mr  Gray asserted that liquidity rules play an important role in ensuring banks have the resources to participate in wider financial markets  Rules forcing the hoarding of liquidity may  thus  crimp that activity   Peter EavisMick Mulvaney  the acting director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau  has complained that the regulator engages in  wasteful spending   He even submitted a quarterly budget request recently of  0 That attitude apparently didn t apply to two of his recent hires Mr  Mulvaney appointed two senior staff members who are paid salaries far above what they had been earning in their previous government jobs in Washington  according to agency documents obtained by The New York Times through a public records request   Kirsten Sutton was hired in January to be the agency s chief of staff  Mr  Mulvaney agreed to pay her  259 500 a year  Her salary is the highest allowed under the consumer bureau s pay scale and represents a raise of more than 50 percent working for one of the C F P B  s fiercest critics  Representative Jeb Hensarling of Texas  the Republican chairman of the House Financial Services Committee  It is also 22 percent more than her predecessor   Brian Johnson is another new deputy  In late December  Mr  Mulvaney signed paperwork that awarded Mr  Johnson a salary of  239 595  Mr  Johnson previously worked on the House Financial Services Committee  In his most recent job there  as policy director  he earned about  170 000 a year  according to LegiStorm  Of the 20 people at the bureau with the title of senior adviser  Mr  Johnson is the second highest paid   Another adviser  whose name wasn t disclosed in the public records reviewed by The Times  is paid  240 000  ContextThe consumer bureau  as well as fellow financial regulators like the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency  is allowed under federal law to pay employees significantly more than other government agencies can pay  The rationale is that the higher salaries are necessary to recruit skilled employees who otherwise might land jobs on Wall Street As a result  the C F P B  is stocked with employees who earn more than the average Washington bureaucrat  Of the agency s 1 600 employees  219 make more than  200 000  according to the records reviewed by The Times   Stacy CowleyBlackRock  the world s largest money manager  plans to offer a series of new products allowing individuals and institutions to invest in market indexes without

JERUSALEM   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel was questioned by the police on Friday as a possible suspect in a third bribery case  the weightiest so far in a string of corruption investigations that are jeopardizing his political future Officers questioned Mr  Netanyahu about a case involving Shaul Elovitch  an Israeli telecommunications tycoon accused of using his popular Hebrew news site to provide positive coverage of Mr  Netanyahu and his wife in return for regulatory and financial benefits worth tens of millions of dollars A large black screen was drawn on Friday morning across leafy Balfour Street in Jerusalem  concealing the prime minister s official residence and the comings and goings of investigators  Outside  a small but noisy group of demonstrators beat drums and held placards with slogans against corruption Mr  Netanyahu  who has now been questioned by the police eight times in the past 14 months  is fighting for his political life as the allegations against him mount  Last month  the police recommended that Mr  Netanyahu be charged with bribery  fraud and breach of trust in two other graft cases involving allegations of illicit gifts for favors and another attempt to obtain more favorable coverage Those cases are now being examined by state prosecutors and the attorney general  who will ultimately decide whether to file charges pending a hearing with Mr  Netanyahu s lawyers  The process could take months Inside the Balfour Street residence  Mr  Netanyahu was questioned for hours under caution as a possible suspect  according to the police  His wife  Sara  was questioned simultaneously as a suspect in the same case at the fraud investigation unit s headquarters in Lod  central Israel The latest twist in a spiraling corruption scandal comes on the eve of Mr  Netanyahu s departure for Washington  where he is scheduled to meet President Trump and address the American Israel Public Affairs Committee s annual policy conference Mr  Netanyahu has made a point of maintaining a high profile presence on the world stage  traveling in recent weeks to India  where he was treated like royalty  to the World Economic Forum in Davos  Switzerland  and to an international security conference in Munich Denying all wrongdoing  Mr  Netanyahu has been trying to project a business as usual approach despite his mounting legal troubles  aiming to burnish his credentials both at home and abroad as an international player In a short video posted on Facebook after he was questioned  Mr  Netanyahu said he was about to embark on  a very important visit  to the United States and added  in reference to the police investigations   I feel confident that nothing will come of it  The questioning of the prime minister  who also served as communications minister from 2014 to 2017  in this latest case was expected Several members of his close circle have been arrested in the case  including Nir Hefetz  a former media adviser to the Netanyahus  and Shlomo Filber  a political operative for Mr  Netanyahu s conservative Likud Party and Mr  Netanyahu s pick as director general of the Communications Ministry  Mr  Filber  a long serving Netanyahu aide  has turned state witness The case involves a dicey mix of political power  big business and personal relationships  Mr  Netanyahu is a friend of Mr  Elovitch  who owns the Eurocom Group holding company  which owns Bezeq  the Israeli telecommunications giant that has long had a near monopoly on land lines in the country Bezek owns Walla  the Israeli news site that has provided lopsidedly flattering coverage of the Netanyahus for months or years  Sara Netanyahu  a friend of Mr  Elovitch s wife  Iris  is reported to have sent messages to her with demands to tilt the coverage in her husband s favor  Mrs  Elovitch has already been arrested in the affair and spent several days in detention Mrs  Netanyahu is facing possible fraud charges in a separate case in which she is accused of misusing about  100 000 in public funds in her management of the prime minister s official residence Among other things  the Communications Ministry is said to have pushed regulators to allow the merger of a money losing satellite network  Yes  also owned by Mr  Elovitch  with Bezeq  a deal that would have reaped huge tax savings for Mr  Elovitch At a hearing for two of the suspects in the case in a Tel Aviv court this week  Yehudit Tirosh  a prosecution lawyer  pointed a finger at Mr  Netanyahu in his role as communications minister  This is a grave case of giving and receiving bribes   Ms  Tirosh was quoted as saying by the Israeli news media   The term  positive coverage  is misleading  This is harnessing a leading website in return for regulatory favors by the minister of communications and the director general of the Ministry of Communications   The value of the regulatory benefits was about  500 million  she said Mr  Netanyahu responded in another Facebook post this week  saying   All actions were carried out in a professional manner based on the recommendations of the professional echelon  professional committees and legal counsel   Jack Chen  a lawyer representing Mr  Elovitch  said in an interview on Friday that the allegations were  baseless   and that his client categorically denied that there was ever any such deal Mr  Netanyahu  who has been accused of accepting nearly  300 000 in gifts over 10 years  has found himself and his close associates accused on a variety of fronts   Case 1000  the gifts for favors affair in which the police last month recommended that Mr  Netanyahu be charged with bribery  fraud and breach of trust   Case 2000  in which Mr  Netanyahu is suspected of back room dealings with Arnon Mozes  publisher of the popular newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth  to ensure more favorable coverage  The police have also recommended charges in that case   Case 3000  which involves suspicions of corruption surrounding a multibillion dollar purchase of submarines and other naval vessels from a German shipyard  Mr  Netanyahu is not a suspect in that case  though some of his closest confidants are   Case 4000  which was the subject of the police questioning on Friday The Walla news site has changed its tune in recent months  offering some considerably less fawning coverage of the Netanyahus In January  it published an earsplitting recorded telephone conversation from 2009 in which Mrs  Netanyahu could be heard berating a publicist over a short gossip column item about her participation in a school fund raising event that did not cite her educational and professional credentials to her satisfaction 
Good Thursday  Here s what we re watching   The leeway in President Trump s tariff order   President Trump authorizes tariffs   What happens when the bond market and the Fed disagree   Cigna struck a big deal for Express Scripts   The White House plans to unveil its tariffs today   Protesters want Visa to stop processing sales of assault style rifles Want this in your inbox each morning  Sign up here President Trump has backed trade restrictions for much of his public life  but his tariff orders have some wiggle room  This leeway could come in useful if his administration needs to step back in the face of economic or political pressure First  the secretary of commerce  Wilbur Ross  has leeway to exempt certain steel and aluminum imports from the restrictions if he determines that the United States lacks the capacity to produce them  There is also a national security exemption  notable since national security concerns are the legal basis for the tariffs Second  the order leaves the door open to discussions with allies other than Mexico and Canada  which are currently exempt  It says that a country that has a security relationship with the United States is welcome to discuss ways to allay the United States  national security concerns  If successful  the president might decide to modify or remove the tariffs   Peter EavisThe president defied allies both in his own party and overseas Thursday and signed an order imposing sweeping new tariffs on imported steel and aluminum  reports the NYT s Peter Baker and Ana Swanson Still  he sought to soften the impact on some of America s closest allies  For now  Canada and Mexico are exempt and there is the possibility of later excluding allies such as Australia  But the order could hit South Korea  China  Japan  Germany  Turkey and Brazil From the NYT The details  The orders will raise levies on foreign steel by 25 percent and on imported aluminum by 10 percent   Mr  Trump said the order would give him the authority to raise or lower levies on a country by country basis and add or take countries off the list as he deems fit   The order goes into effect in 15 days Tariff flyaround  A group of 11 nations   including major United States allies like Japan  Canada and Australia   signed a broad trade deal on Thursday that challenges Mr  Trump s view of trade as a zero sum game filled with winners and losers   NYT   The chances of a complete breakdown in the global trade system remain remote  if a little less remote than a week ago   NYT   The marriage of establishment and populist economic thinking was always an uneasy one  Now President Trump s steel and aluminum tariffs are forcing the Republican party to choose between its core business supporters and populist voters   WSJ   The tariffs have caused much concern about President Trump s trade policy  A probe into Chinese intellectual property policy could prove more devastating   Breakingviews When the Federal Reserve and the bond market are at loggerheads  it s almost as if the economy s parents are fighting  The kids  stock investors and borrowers in this analogy  just don t know who to side with This dynamic appears to explain what happened in early February when inflation fears sent bond prices lower and  in turn  set off panicked selling in the stock market Now  as the Fed gets ready to raise interest rates several times  differences between the central bank and the bond market could start to matter more There is no conclusive way to measure the degree of disagreement between the Fed and the bond markets  But that didn t stop us having a go One approach is to compare the yield on the bellwether 10 year Treasury note with Fed policymakers  forecasts for the central bank s target rate  Several times a year  the policymakers project where the federal funds target rate will be at different points in the future  In this exercise  we compared the 10 year s yield with the median forecast made in December for the target rate at the end of the next year In December of 2014  2015 and 2016  the 10 year s yield was around 1 percentage point higher than the forecast But in December last year  the difference between the two numbers had shrunk markedly  The yield was only 0 26 of a percentage point above the forecast One interpretation of this narrowing  The bond market was behind in reacting to economic strength  And when it did snap out of its possibly complacent state  it did so sharply  The 10 year yield is now 2 88 percent  up from 2 39 percent before the meeting in Dec  2017 With that increase  there was a 0 77 percentage point difference between the policymakers forecast and the yield on the 10 year Treasury on Monday But if the 10 year yield moved up to reestablish a 1 percentage point difference  it would sail past the psychologically important 3 percent mark The problem  of course  with using Fed policymakers  forecasts is that the Fed has made them public only for a few years To get a much longer perspective  we looked back at the actual interest rate that the Fed targets  which is set in the market for the funds that banks must keep on deposit at the Fed  We compared this effective federal funds rate with the 10 year s yield On Monday  that spread was 1 46 percentage points  How does that compare  It s tighter than the median for the past eight years  1 95 percentage points  The 10 year yield would have moved a lot higher to take the spread back there But there is a less alarming viewpoint  The current 1 46 percentage point spread is only slightly higher than the median 1 24 percentage points for the 50 plus years we studied And  perhaps most reassuringly  1 46 percentage points is very close to the 1 67 percentage point median for June 2003 till the end of 2006  a period in which the Fed raised interest rates repeatedly   Peter EavisCigna finally got a big deal done by buying Express Scripts  one of the U S  s largest drug benefits

PARK CITY  Utah   At the Sundance Film Festival here in January  executives at A24  the upstart movie and television studio  stood in the back of a makeshift theater looking as if they were about to be physically ill A24 s latest offering   Eighth Grade   an intimate coming of age dramedy set for release in theaters on July 13  was minutes away from its festival premiere  What if the audience hated it   This movie is just so personal for me   Nicolette Aizenberg  an A24 executive  said to someone who had just asked why she was quite literally shaking in her brown snow boots There was zero reason to worry   Eighth Grade   directed by the 27 year old comedian Bo Burnham  received sustained hoots of approval from the hipster attendees and universal raves from critics  likely setting up the film as another art house hit for A24  a little New York company that has   seemingly out of nowhere   established itself as Hollywood s leading tastemaker brand  Miramax for a new generation Since starting five years ago  A24 has delivered one cultural thunderclap after another  peaking with  Moonlight   last year s surprise winner  especially to the folks of  La La Land   of the Oscar for best picture  Other A24 hits over the past few years include  Spring Breakers   about college girls who get mixed up with a messianic drug and arms dealer  the creepy cool  Ex Machina   which introduced the future Oscar winner Alicia Vikander to most viewers   The Lobster   a dystopian cult favorite  and the Oscar winning  Room   Brie Larson for best actress   Among the A24 films up for Oscars at this Sunday s Academy Awards ceremony are  The Disaster Artist   adapted screenplay  and  The Florida Project   Willem Dafoe  supporting actor  But the studio s biggest hit so far  both critically and commercially  is the film nominated for five Oscars this year  including best picture  Greta Gerwig s  Lady Bird   which has collected about  50 million in North American ticket sales   Its other Oscar nominations include best director  for Ms  Gerwig  and best actress  for Saoirse Ronan   Scott Rudin  a producer of both  Lady Bird  and  Eighth Grade   said in an email that A24 has  the best team I have ever worked with anywhere  and since I am now approaching Methuselah s age  that is a considerable statement  Last year  A24 edged ahead of the art house titan Fox Searchlight in domestic market share and trounced Annapurna  a like minded upstart founded by the Oracle heiress Megan Ellison  Most other specialty film studios are either focusing on older audiences  Sony Pictures Classics   working to regain their footing after retrenchments  Focus Features  or essentially out of business  including Broad Green Pictures and the scandal plagued Weinstein Company  which this week reached an agreement with an investor group that will apparently allow it to avert bankruptcy  They are the original Coca Cola   Mr  Rudin said of A24   and everybody else is New Coke  Except for Searchlight  which is Tab  A24 is now moving full speed into television  The studio s odd  Comrade Detective   starring Channing Tatum and purporting to be a lost Romanian cop show  arrived on Amazon in August  Agents say that A24 ultimately hopes to self finance four to six new series annually Exactly how has A24  an offbeat  55 person company named after an Italian highway  managed to get tough customers like Mr  Rudin eating out of its hand  Moreover  how has the company so quickly created such a strong consumer identity  with analysts saying that fans are starting to buy tickets simply because they see A24 s retro logo on a trailer And what makes A24 think it can avoid the usual indie film pitfalls  Burn hot  crash hard   See  Miramax  A24 declined interview requests  Its founders   David Fenkel  Daniel Katz and John Hodges  all of whom have extensive art film experience   seem to see a sense of mystery as part of their branding and competitive strategy  or at least they don t want A24 to fall into the trap of a Weinstein style cult of personality   Frankly  nobody outside the tent has the slightest understanding of what they do  which is very  very smart   Mr  Rudin said Founded with a few million dollars in seed money from Guggenheim Partners  where Mr  Katz once led the film finance group  A24 has been constructed around one notion  There has to be a better way As the DVD market collapsed  making thin studio profit margins even thinner  film companies became desperate to cut marketing costs   spray and pray  television campaigns mostly  by going directly to consumers through Facebook  Instagram and Twitter  But most established studios   hindered by hierarchies and allergic to talk of social media algorithms   were struggling to treat tweets and Instagram posts as the spine of a marketing campaign instead of an add on The A24 trio decided the only way to seize the moment was to forget about retrofitting a company and build a nimble new one from the ground up  As a foundation  they made a deal with Amazon Prime for exclusive post theatrical streaming rights  DirecTV agreed to spend tens of millions to jointly acquire films with A24 for offer on its video on demand system  giving the fledgling studio a digital laboratory of a sort  and a place to dump titles not ready for theatrical scrutiny   For most theatrical releases  A24 would spend roughly 95 percent of its marketing money online  using data and analytics to stitch films into the social media firmament in ways that prompts movie lovers to feel a sense of discovery and pass the message on organically   persuading fans to persuade one another  Everything about A24 is just fresh as a new daisy   said Barry Diller  the former Hollywood mogul who runs IAC InterActive Corporation and has invested in several A24 projects   Enthusiasm  Aggression  Sheer smarts  Mr  Fenkel formerly ran the independent film company Oscilloscope  which he co founded with the Beastie Boys rapper Adam Yauch  Mr  Hodges started his career at USA Films  which became Focus Features  A24 is owned by management  with Eldridge Industries holding a minority stake  Eldridge  founded by the former president of Guggenheim Partners  Todd Boehly  also owns The Hollywood Reporter and Dick Clark Productions Insiders say that the A24 culture bears more similarities to Silicon Valley than Hollywood  It s run like a collective  Nobody has a formal title  Young staff members are empowered to challenge the founders  It was Ms  Aizenberg  who focuses on publicity  who caught  The Florida Project  at last year s Cannes Film Festival and made a passionate case for A24 to buy the stylized drama   The New York Times critic A O  Scott called it  risky and revelatory    When NBCUniversal recently wanted to invest in A24  the studio decided it would rather remain independent  I felt like there was a huge opportunity to create something where the talented people could be talented   Mr  Katz told GQ magazine in May It has not done it alone  One secret weapon has been Operam  a stealth data and marketing start up that helps studios  including Fox Searchlight  develop algorithms used to target potential ticket buyers on Facebook and other digital platforms  Another sophisticated vendor that has contributed to A24 s success is Watson DG  a web focused marketing agency At the same time  A24 s founders tapped into a deep unhappiness among young filmmakers about the state of the film business  Across Hollywood  all most executives talk about are franchises and  tent poles   movies with edges sanded off so they can play to the widest possible global audience  Even most art house companies  struggling to fill seats in the age of Netflix  have become more dependent on stars and marketable concepts  Nothing bums out the auteur set faster At A24  the talk is about artistic impulses first and foremost   how do we make a really cool movie   and then the studio tries to lean into whatever that may be in its marketing campaign  even if it s weird   They seem like they are relying only on their taste and instinct  and that confidence makes everyone want to work with them   said Scott Neustadter  who is nominated with Michael H  Weber for an adapted screenplay Oscar for  The Disaster Artist  Even so  the sustainability of A24 remains a question The specialty film business is an increasingly challenging one  Amazon and Netflix have been driving up prices for talent  With many viewers content to watch stylized film on their living room televisions  art house theaters have been going out of business  There is no guarantee that A24 s guerrilla marketing strategies will support more mainstream movies  as the studio aims to start adding to its slate  As A24 grows  it will become harder to avoid the clash of egos and calcification into hierarchies And A24 has savvy competitors hot on its tail  One is Neon  which is also focused on using social media to go after millennials  Founded last year by Tom Quinn  a longtime independent film executive  and Tim League  the chief executive of the funky Alamo Drafthouse theater chain  Neon was behind  I  Tonya   the darkly comedic Tonya Harding biopic that has collected about  30 million  Its star  Margot Robbie  is nominated for best actress on Sunday  Allison Janney is up for best supporting actress The studio is also not the most successful new entertainment company to recently come along  That prize without question goes to Blumhouse Productions  which is focused on low cost  auteur driven horror movies like  Get Out  and has a first look deal at Universal Pictures  Last year  Blumhouse films took in nearly  700 million worldwide  Blumhouse has also been behind  Whiplash   nominated for the best picture Oscar in 2015  and the TV series  The Jinx  The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst  In fact  looking at A24 s box office results  it would be easy to wonder what all the fuss is about  Before  Lady Bird   the studio s biggest hit was  Moonlight   which collected about  28 million at the domestic box office  making it one of the lowest grossing films ever to be named best picture   It also cost only  1 5 million to make  however   A24 has also had its share of misfires  including the 2014 crime drama  A Most Violent Year   which cost  20 million and collected  5 8 million But even those in Hollywood who believe A24 is overhyped   and there are plenty  perhaps nudged along by envy   concede that the studio has done an astounding job at building a brand And it appears just to be getting started  In an unusual move by Hollywood standards  the studio introduced its own podcast this week    A24 in your eardrums  No host  no ads  no rules    It publishes an A24 magazine that is distributed free in trendy hotels  The company also sells limited edition merchandise on its website and is planning special musical events  What s so interesting is that they re tapping into a new type of entertainment enthusiast   said DeeDee Gordon  an independent brand strategist who has consulted for A24   It s similar  I think  to what happened in foodie culture  It used to be a rarefied niche  Then it became democratized  Every income level  Every life stage  Global  That is the opportunity that A24 now has at its fingertips  
Conservatives are zeroing in on a new enemy in the political culture wars  Big Tech Arguing that Silicon Valley is stifling their speech and suppressing right wing content  publishers and provocateurs on the right are eyeing a public relations battle against online giants like Google and Facebook  the same platforms they once relied on to build a national movement In a sign of escalation  Peter Schweizer  a right wing journalist known for his investigations into Hillary Clinton  plans to release a new film focusing on technology companies and their role in filtering the news Tentatively titled  The Creepy Line   Mr  Schweizer s documentary is expected to have its first screening in May in Cannes  France   during the Cannes Film Festival  but not as part of the official competition  He used the same rollout two years ago for his previous film  an adaptation of his book  Clinton Cash  that he produced with Stephen K  Bannon  the former head of Breitbart News  The Creepy Line  alludes to an infamous 2010 speech by Eric Schmidt  the chief executive of Google at the time  who dismissed concerns about privacy by declaring that his company s policy was  to get right up to the creepy line and not cross it  The documentary  which has not been previously reported  dovetails with concerns raised in recent weeks by right wing groups about censorship on digital media   a new front in a rapidly evolving culture war If the mainstream media is a perennial enemy of the right  Big Tech is a fresh and novel foe  arguably more relevant to 2018  Facebook  Google and their ilk are facing tough questions about their inability to police the content they distribute  including Russian propaganda during the 2016 presidential campaign  The companies have also been accused by lawmakers  critics and activists of monopolistic tendencies and manipulative product design The critique from conservatives  in contrast  casts the big tech companies as censorious and oppressive  all too eager to stifle right wing content in an effort to mollify liberal critics  This could end up being the free speech issue of our time   said Alex Marlow  editor in chief of Breitbart News  which has published articles accusing Google and Facebook of  among other sins  political bias   The Silicon Valley elites are saying   We don t care what you want to see   we know what you should see  We know better   Big Tech is easily associated with West Coast liberalism and Democratic politics  making it a fertile target for the right  And operational opacity at Facebook  Google and Twitter  which are reluctant to reveal details about their algorithms and internal policies  can leave them vulnerable  too  It s the perfect foil   said Eli Pariser  a former executive director of the liberal activist group MoveOn org and the author of  The Filter Bubble   a book about how consumers find information online   There s not even a real basis to establish objective research about what s happening on Facebook  because it s closed  Google  Facebook and Twitter loomed large at last month s Conservative Political Action Conference in Oxon Hill  Md   where dozens of guests squeezed into a standing room only ballroom for a discussion called  Suppression of Conservative Views on Social Media  A First Amendment Issue  Among the panelists were James O Keefe  the guerrilla filmmaker who has tried to undermine news outlets like The New York Times  The Washington Post and CNN  and James Damore  an engineer fired by Google after he circulated a memo arguing that biological differences accounted for the low number of women in engineering Mr  Damore   a new celebrity in the right wing world  who  in an interview  said of his first foray to CPAC   There s definitely a lot of people that want to take selfies    described a culture of dogmatic liberalism at Google  There are political activists in all of these companies that want to actively push a liberal agenda   he said   Why does it matter  Because these companies are so ubiquitous and powerful that they are controlling all the means of mass communication  Before Mr  Damore spoke  organizers distributed baseball caps to guests emblazoned with an illustration of Twitter s bird logo  upside down and with its eyes crossed out The panelists accused social media platforms of delisting their videos or stripping them of advertising  Such charges have long been staples of far right online discourse  especially among YouTubers  but Mr  Schweizer s project is poised to bring such arguments to a new   and potentially larger   audience Mr  Schweizer  53  was a speechwriting consultant to President George W  Bush  His reporting has been cited by The Times and  60 Minutes   although he often uses a bombastic style akin to that of Breitbart News He is also the president of the Government Accountability Institute  a conservative nonprofit organization  He and Mr  Bannon founded it with funding from the family of Robert Mercer  the billionaire hedge fund manager and donor to Donald J  Trump s presidential campaign Mr  Schweizer declined to identify the film s financial backers  A spokeswoman for the institute said it was not involved in the project In some ways  the complaints from the right about Big Tech mirror the grumblings of legacy news organizations  which have expressed concern that online algorithms wield too much power over how readers gain access to their content Jeffrey A  Zucker  the president of CNN  derided Google and Facebook as  monopolies  and called for regulators to step in during a speech in Spain last month  saying the tech hegemony is  the biggest issue facing the growth of journalism in the years ahead   And former President Barack Obama said at an off the record conference at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology last month that he worried Americans were living in  entirely different realities  and that large tech companies like Facebook were  not just an invisible platform  they re shaping our culture in powerful ways   The contents of the speech were published by Reason magazine In the right s more internet savvy quarters  tech platforms have been a regular   and fruitful   subject of discussion since before the 2016 election  In May that year  Facebook was forced to respond to claims that the curators of its Trending Topics feature had suppressed conservative news sources  a controversy that called attention to Facebook s editorial power That charge of editorial bias was echoed last weekend by Alex Jones  the conspiracy theorist behind Infowars  who accused YouTube of planning to delete his organization s account  a claim that was widely shared among conservatives YouTube did delete some videos that accused teenage survivors of the Parkland  Fla   school shooting of being  crisis actors   and it issued  strikes   or warnings  to the accounts of Infowars and Jerome Corsi  a conservative author and Infowars contributor   YouTube denied that it had plans to delete the Infowars account  Facebook has also caught flak for adjusting  the algorithm for its News Feed to emphasize posts from  friends  family and groups  over content from public pages  The change was part of an effort by the company to answer criticism  but also to reinvigorate its oldest and most profitable product  which recently recorded a decline in American daily users for the first time in its history The Facebook adjustment has affected virtually every media organization that is partly dependent on the platform for audiences  but it appears to have hit some harder than others  They include right wing sites like Gateway Pundit and the millennial focused Independent Journal Review  which was forced to lay off staff members last month The social news giant BuzzFeed recently bought ads on Facebook with the message   Facebook is taking the news out of your News Feed  but we ve got you covered   directing users to download its app  Away from the political scrum  the viral lifestyle site LittleThings  once a top publisher on the platform  announced last week that it would cease operations  blaming  a full on catastrophic update  to Facebook s revised algorithms Right wing media has pounced  In late February  citing statistics from the social analytics firm NewsWhip  Breitbart published an article on the effects on the president s Facebook page with the headline  EXCLUSIVE  Trump s Facebook Engagement Declined By 45 Percent Following Algorithm Change   The drop  the article insinuated  occurred  following a year of pressure from left wing employees and the mainstream media for  allowing  the president to win the 2016 general election  Still  the brewing backlash did not stop Google and Facebook from courting the very crowd that now seems ready to declare them enemies  Both companies were sponsors at this year s CPAC  leading to a few awkward moments Facebook  which sponsored a  help desk  for attendees featuring smiling representatives and cookies frosted with emoji icons  provided a demonstration of its virtual reality program  Oculus  But the company was forced to apologize for including a first person shooter simulation  given that the conference took place a week after the Parkland massacre Google  which has co sponsored CPAC three of the past six years  held a lavish reception for attendees featuring an open bar and a roaring outdoor fireplace Mr  Marlow  the editor of Breitbart  was asked in an interview what he thought about Google s giving a party in the midst of a crowd that is gunning for it  The least they can do   Mr  Marlow said   is buy us a drink  
The secretary of education  Betsy DeVos  had only just announced that she would visit Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School when the students began to react  Good thing I was already planning on sleeping in tomorrow   Emma González tweeted out to her 1 2 million followers Tuesday evening  Literally no one asked for this   said her classmate  Sarah Chadwick   to an additional 269 000 followers And with a handful of tweets  the students had overtaken another adult official s narrative  They were in command of their own story once again It has become obvious that many of the most well known students at Stoneman Douglas in Parkland  Fla   are adept at using social media  and Twitter in particular  where many journalists spend much of their time talking to one another With their consistent tweeting of stories  memes  jokes and video clips  the students have managed to keep the tragedy that their school experienced   and their plan to stop such shootings from happening elsewhere   in the news for weeks  long after past mass shootings have faded from the headlines Many observers have simply assumed that  like fish in water  the students are skilled simply because they have been using the platforms for most of their lives  That is not entirely true Ms  González became one of the most well known of the shooting survivors after giving a passionate speech about gun control the Saturday after the attack  But when her name began to trend on Twitter  she did not know how to use it  You know that meme where it s a picture of a grandma in front of a computer   she said in a recent interview   That was me  In the early days  someone DM d me and I was like   O K   so how do I respond  Where does the keyboard go      A DM is a private message  Ms  González  18  had been more of a Tumblr fan  She was also a fan of Instagram  but  before the shooting  had begun to use the platform less frequently after realizing she was wasting her time on it And Facebook  Facebook is not really used by the people in my community  Ms  González was surrounded by classmates who were familiar with Twitter s ever evolving dialect of memes  wisecracks and news stories  Within a week  she said  they had taught her the basics  How to make a thread  How to follow a thread  And  perhaps most importantly  the difference between a retweet  which reposts someone else s tweet  and a quote tweet  which allows a user to retweet with a comment above the original The Parkland students  use of quote tweets is one of their most effective tools  Ms  Chadwick  in particular  has used the technique  as well as other memes to mock the students  ideological opponents In one memorable exchange  Ms  Chadwick was scrolling through her Twitter feed last month when she saw someone remark that politicians were  easy to buy   She and her classmates had spent the last week educating themselves on how easy the AR 15 was to purchase  She made the obvious connection  and tweeted The Fox News host Laura Ingraham chided Ms  Chadwick  16  for her tone  and attributed the quote to  Stoneman Douglas sophomore Sarah Chadwick  Ms  Chadwick s response Given their single minded focus on preventing school shootings  the more prominent Parkland students most often find themselves tangling with conservative politicians and commentators who support broad gun ownership rights  including Senator Marco Rubio  Ms  Ingraham  the N R A  spokeswoman Dana Loesch and the Fox News contributor Tomi Lahren The Florida senator  who has vast experience being mocked on Twitter by his political opponents  declined to comment directly on Ms  Chadwick s tweet  A spokeswoman for Mr  Rubio pointed toward his recent tweets about political discourse  and how the two sides need to learn to talk each other again In response to a call and texts  Ms  Loesch  who is usually not shy about responding online or elsewhere to critics  directed an interview request to an N R A  official  who declined to comment And as for Ms  DeVos  Students said that she spoke to few of them on her visit Wednesday  and left in a hurry In an interview on Tuesday  Ms  Lahren applauded the students  use of social media to fight for their views  She said she was not bothered by quote tweets  which she saw as simply  a way to continue a conversation   a tool that she said that she also used frequently But when it was pointed out that one of Ms  Chadwick s  meme tweets instructed her to  stop talking   she added   I hope these kids understand that free speech isn t just saying what you want to say  it s hearing what you don t want to hear  It s great to be vocal about your stance but simply telling someone to stop talking doesn t seem very constructive  Quote tweeting may allow Twitter users some small window into the other sides of a debate  Delaney Tarr  who had about 500 followers before the shooting and now has close to 97 000  said she believed the tool breaks through the filter bubbles that keep ideological opponents from hearing each other  Even if people maybe side with the other people a little bit more  they understand both sides   she said  of the benefits of quote tweeting   We want people to be educated  The social media activism has come with a cost for the high schoolers  who before the shooting just used these platforms to keep up with friends  make jokes and pass the time  Ms  Tarr was one of several students interviewed who said that she no longer felt comfortable using her Twitter account to express her opinions on pop culture  or the other lighter subjects she used to tweet about  The fact is that I have to represent our movement   she said   It s not just me tweeting whatever I want to tweet about  It has to be drawn back to who I am to the media  to who I am to the country  It is another way in which the students at Parkland have lost the normalcy of their teenage years  Ryan Deitsch said that he did not feel comfortable even tweeting his opinion of  Black Panther   he thought it was great and that comparisons to  Thor  Ragnarok  were beside the point   Many other parts of his life have been put on hold  He has yet to respond to the colleges that have accepted him All of the students scoffed at the idea that they were coordinating their tweets  But they did say that as they are all following one another on the various platforms  they frequently alight on the same subject or tweet   When reached for interviews  several of them were in the same room   On Tuesday  a handful of them worked together to make a video parody of Ms  Loesch s own video using an hourglass to tell celebrities and other N R A  critics  your time is running out  But while Ms  González and Ms  Chadwick said they usually composed their tweets on the fly  Ms  Tarr said she often took more time  mindful of her new audience and of the gravity of what she says online now  I ll start typing a tweet  then I ll delete it   she said   I ll think  what else can I say  then type and delete again  I do miss having that teenage Twitter account  But we don t get that regular teenage life anymore  It just doesn t exist  
WASHINGTON   Facebook on Wednesday said that the data of up to 87 million users may have been improperly shared with a political consulting firm connected to President Trump during the 2016 election   a figure far higher than the estimate of 50 million that had been widely cited since the leak was reported last month Mark Zuckerberg  the company s chief executive  also announced that Facebook would offer all of its users the same tools and controls required under European privacy rules  The European rules  which go into effect next month  give people more control over how companies use their digital data Facebook had not previously disclosed how many accounts had been harvested by Cambridge Analytica  the firm connected to the Trump campaign  It has also been reluctant to disclose how it was used by Russian backed actors to influence the 2016 presidential election Among Facebook s acknowledgments on Wednesday was the disclosure of a vulnerability in its search and account recovery functions that it said could have exposed  most  of its 2 billion users to having their public profile information harvested The new effort to appear more transparent about the data leaks   including a rare question and answer session with Mr  Zuckerberg and reporters   came just before Mr  Zuckerberg s expected testimony next week on Capitol Hill  where he will most likely face criticism over how the company collects and shares the personal data of its users  Sheryl Sandberg  Mr  Zuckerberg s top deputy  has several national television interviews scheduled for later this week The company said that on Monday it would start telling users whether their information may have been shared with Cambridge Analytica Andy Stone  a spokesman for Facebook in Washington  said the 87 million figure was an estimate of the total number of users whose data could have been acquired by Cambridge Analytica  He said that the estimate was calculated by adding up all the friends of the people who had logged into the Facebook app from which Cambridge Analytica collected profile data  We wanted to put out the maximum number of people who could have been affected   Mr  Zuckerberg told reporters It remains unclear exactly how many users had their personal information accessed by Cambridge Analytica  The firm said Wednesday that it had licensed data for no more than 30 million users of the social network Facebook also released a lengthy document describing how it would protect personal data in the future  In that document  Facebook said its search and account recovery systems had been open to abuse by anyone who already had some information about an individual  such as a phone number or email address  The vulnerability extended to much of the platform s user base before it was closed on Wednesday  Facebook said The company also said it would limit the types of data that can be harvested by software used by outside businesses  The changes mean that users will have to give permission before an app can collect information beyond their names and addresses The company also said it would no longer allow outsiders to use apps to gather information about the religious or political views of its users  And it will stop using third party data from companies such as Experian and Acxiom to help supplement its own data for ad targeting  It s clear now that we didn t focus enough on preventing abuse   Mr  Zuckerberg said   We didn t take a broad enough view of what our responsibility is  That was a huge mistake  and it was my mistake  The Federal Trade Commission is investigating whether Facebook violated a 2011 agreement meant to protect users  privacy  User data is crucial to the company s business  because it is used to deliver advertising to users Mr  Zuckerberg is scheduled to testify about the company s handling of sensitive user data before the Senate s Commerce and Judiciary committees on Tuesday and the House Energy and Commerce Committee on Wednesday  This hearing will be an important opportunity to shed light on critical consumer data privacy issues   said Representatives Greg Walden  Republican of Oregon  and Frank Pallone  Democrat of New Jersey  of the House committee Senator Chuck Grassley  the Republican chairman of the Judiciary Committee  said   With all of the data exchanged over Facebook and other platforms  users deserve to know how their information is shared and secured  Facebook s problems stretch back before the reports about Cambridge Analytica  to earlier investigations into how Russian actors infiltrated the platform by placing ads and posts to influence the 2016 election  Mr  Zuckerberg initially dismissed the idea of foreign interference on Facebook as a  crazy idea  Since then  the company has been the focus of investigations by law enforcement and congressional committees that are delving into the Russian influence campaign  Facebook now acknowledges that its platform was used to sway voters All those troubles have prompted investors to flee the company  and its stock has fallen sharply in recent weeks In response  the company has put its executives front and center Mr  Zuckerberg typically talks to groups of reporters only after the company releases its quarterly financial reports  But after not responding in public for several days following the Cambridge Analytica disclosure  he has given a series of interviews And Ms  Sandberg  Facebook s chief operating officer and the second most recognizable face at the company  is set to be interviewed this week by Fox News   PBS NewsHour   NBC s  Today  show and Bloomberg  Ms  Sandberg will be interviewed remotely from California Facebook said its new openness was meant to show that it takes the intense criticism over its handling of user data seriously In Washington  Facebook employees and public relations firms retained by the company have talked to regulators and congressional staff members about new privacy measures  including updates to policies that are intended to make them easier to understand On Wednesday  Mr  Zuckerberg provided a preview of what he will tell Congress next week  He said Facebook was  an idealistic and optimistic company  But he acknowledged that the company had committed serious errors by not ensuring that robust safeguards were in place for users Asked if he should still be leading the company  he said   Yes  Life is about learning from the mistakes and learning what you need to go forward  Terrell McSweeny  a Democratic member of the Federal Trade Commission  said that Mr  Zuckerberg has a big task ahead of him in Washington  I think it is important for Zuckerberg to clearly explain how Facebook plans to earn back consumer trust   Ms  McSweeny said   Consumers need reassurance that their data are not being misused  
The recent tribulations of Facebook  which has lurched from crisis to crisis over the last year  most recently over the handling of users  personal data  has pushed a few of the industry s most prominent names to speak out against the company Marc Benioff  the chief executive of Salesforce com  has compared the deleterious effects of social media to those of tobacco and alcohol  and has called for more regulation of those tech companies  Timothy D  Cook  Apple s chief executive  has also suggested new regulation protecting personal data might be in order for businesses like Facebook  I think that this certain situation is so dire and has become so large that probably some well crafted regulation is necessary   Mr  Cook said recently at an event in China  referring to Facebook s recent problems But don t expect a long lineup of other industry leaders to speak out any time soon Although technology companies have their differences  a spirit of comity prevails among its leaders in moments of crisis  For example  technology chiefs have mostly kept quiet about Uber s travails   from its efforts to sidestep law enforcement to a pedestrian death caused by one of its self driving cars   even if they might express their opinions privately Representatives from companies as varied as Amazon  Microsoft and Slack declined to comment for this story  Part of the silence  people in the industry say  comes from a desire to avoid the business equivalent of bad karma   knowing that they  too  may one day face the buzz saw of public censure Others say companies have little moral standing to criticize Facebook s practices  when they have themselves relied on the social network to acquire customers  using the same ad targeting tools that rely on personal data that have stirred up so much controversy in the context of politics  I think we just have to acknowledge the entire industry s complicity with what s happening with Facebook   said Glenn Kelman  chief executive of Redfin  an internet real estate firm   It s almost like we re Inspector Renault in  Casablanca  where we say we re shocked  shocked with what s happening and then a moment later someone hands us our winnings   We ve all been advertising avidly on Facebook   Mr  Kelman added Many companies are also linked to Facebook through partnerships  professional organizations and a worldview about the power of data that is not all that different from that of Mark Zuckerberg  the chief executive of Facebook  It has been really hard for executives to turn their back on the gold mine of big data even in the face of compelling arguments to do so   said Roger McNamee  an early investor in Facebook and a mentor of Mr  Zuckerberg s before becoming one of the company s most vocal detractors   The C E O s who are stepping forward here are taking the long view  Vanessa Chan  a spokeswoman for Facebook  declined to comment There are many critics of Facebook in Silicon Valley  They include former tech workers  venture capitalists and entrepreneurs like Brian Acton  who became a billionaire when Facebook acquired WhatsApp  a messaging company he helped found   It is time   deletefacebook   Mr  Acton posted on Twitter last month But there are few active corporate leaders in Silicon Valley who have taken a stand  Most of the handful of chiefs who have spoken out against Facebook have long been forthright on the topic of privacy  It is no coincidence that their businesses do not rely on the collection of personal data to the same degree that most internet companies do  Mr  Cook of Apple  which makes the vast majority of its revenue from the sale of devices  has for years declared that  when an online service is free  you re not the customer   you re the product  Steve Dowling  a spokesman for Apple  declined to comment When asked about the Facebook s difficulties at an event in China recently  Ginni Rometty  chief executive of IBM  said companies needed to give their users better control over their personal information   Ginni has long believed that individuals or customers own their data   not platforms   said Edward Barbini  a spokesman for IBM Noah Theran  s spokesman for the Internet Association  a trade group that counts Facebook and Salesforce among its members  though not Apple and IBM  said maintaining privacy and security was a top priority for internet companies  Internet companies comply with a wide variety of data privacy and security laws and regulations that are actively enforced by the F T C  and state attorneys general   Mr  Theran said   Trust and comfort with our products and services is essential to a thriving internet  and the internet industry is committed to providing people with information and tools to make informed choices about how their personal information is used  seen and shared online  Another tech leader  Elon Musk  chief executive of Tesla and SpaceX  said recently on Twitter that none of his companies advertise on the social network and vowed to take down the official Facebook pages for Tesla and SpaceX  It s not a political statement and I didn t do this because someone dared me to do it   he wrote   Just don t like Facebook  Gives me the willies  Sorry  Mr  McNamee  the early Facebook investor  believes more industry leaders should speak out  partly because he predicts the United States can and should eventually adopt more stringent regulations akin to those emerging in Europe  Companies that get ahead of that curve   he said   will be way more successful than those who can pretend they can sustain

SHANGHAI   Civil society groups in Myanmar on Thursday criticized Facebook s chief executive  Mark Zuckerberg  arguing that he mischaracterized his company s effectiveness at detecting and quashing messages encouraging violence in the country Taking aim at comments Mr  Zuckerberg made in a recent interview  the groups said that Facebook had no consistent methods for dealing with hate speech in Myanmar  The same problems keep recurring  they said  with the company routinely failing to follow up on their comments and suggestions In a conversation with Ezra Klein of Vox this week  Mr  Zuckerberg referred to a pair of chain letters that were widely shared in Myanmar on Facebook Messenger last year  One message warned Buddhist groups about an imminent attack by Muslims  expected on Sept  11  The other  spread among Muslims  cautioned of violence from Buddhist nationalists on the same date  So that s the kind of thing where I think it is clear that people were trying to use our tools in order to incite real harm   Mr  Zuckerberg said   Now  in that case  our systems detect that that s going on  We stop those messages from going through  In an open letter  the organizations  which have worked with Facebook to flag dangerous and misleading content  including the chain letters  said the messages had spread for days  caused widespread fear and set off at least three violent incidents They also said there was no system at all  only a group of organizations and volunteers doing their best to keep up with a torrent of vitriol  In your interview  you refer to your detection  systems   We believe your system  in this case  was us   and we were far from systematic   the letter says   From where we stand  this case exemplifies the very opposite of effective moderation  It reveals an overreliance on third parties  a lack of a proper mechanism for emergency escalation  a reticence to engage local stakeholders around systemic solutions and a lack of transparency  Facebook responded to the criticism in a satement on Friday   We are sorry that Mark did not make clearer that it was the civil society groups in Myanmar who first reported these messages   it said   We took their reports very seriously and immediately investigated ways to help prevent the spread of this content  We should have been faster  and are working hard to improve our technology and tools to detect and prevent abusive  hateful or false content  Myanmar highlights existential questions about Facebook s mission and responsibilities  The site has closely connected people in the country   in many cases  Facebook is the only online service they use  It has also become a major channel for the spread of hate speech and propaganda that has encouraged and obfuscated ethnic cleansing of the country s Muslim Rohingya  according to human rights groups Almost 700 000 Rohingya have fled to neighboring Bangladesh since last summer  when the military started a crackdown in the country s western Rakhine State  Last month  United Nations investigators said Facebook played a role in spreading hate speech that incited violence against the Rohingya For Mr  Zuckerberg  the timing of the letter is bad  Both he and his top deputy  Sheryl Sandberg  are making multiple media appearances this week to address questions about how the company handles users  personal data  The company has faced harsh criticism for reports on how information about millions of users may have been improperly leaked to a political consulting firm connected to President Trump s 2016 campaign The criticism has sent the company s stock tumbling  Next week  Mr  Zuckerberg is expected to appear at multiple congressional hearings Among the half dozen signatories of the letter posted on Thursday in Myanmar are Phandeeyar  a leading technology hub in the country that helped Facebook draft its Burmese language community standards  Myanmar ICT for Development Organization  which monitors online hate speech  and the Center for Social Integrity The letter lists what the groups say are several problems with Facebook  It says the company lacks adequate tools to report messages that might incite violence  It also says Facebook failed to provide channels for organizations to communicate with data and engineering employees who might have been able to devise solutions to the problems  Presumably  your data team should be able to trace the original sources of flagged messages and posts and identify repeat offenders  using these insights to inform your moderation and sanctioning   the letter says Jes Petersen  chief executive of Phandeeyar  said problematic messages in Myanmar were not a one time problem  There s multiple cases of similar things that have happened where we ve done everything we can to bring it to Facebook s attention but we don t see much happening on their end   he said   That s a big part of the problem  Victoire Rio  a social media analyst in the country who previously worked at Phandeeyar  said another major issue was Facebook s lack of Burmese speakers for local monitors to communicate directly with  It s evident to us that there are not enough resources and not enough human resources dedicated to Myanmar   Ms  Rio said  She added that the company s Burmese speaking reviewers were based in Dublin  and from the company s recruiting pages it seems it is struggling to find qualified candidates The groups also faulted Facebook s lack of transparency  They said that after they had reported the messages that Mr  Zuckerberg cited in his interview  they heard nothing from the company about what happened or how Facebook would better respond  I was seriously concerned and looking for anyone I could   Ms  Rio said   I was surprised to hear that Mark had been contacted about this fairly quickly  the use of strong language was effective  
As the Mets and Phillies faced off at Citi Field on Wednesday  they also played the role of guinea pigs in a new Major League Baseball experiment  participating in its first digital only national broadcast The game was shown on Facebook  which partnered with M L B  to exclusively produce and broadcast 25 games this season as part of baseball s efforts to appeal to a younger audience and tap into fans  online discussions The Mets Phillies game was the first of the 25 games set to be aired on Facebook   one per week   and the early feedback was largely negative  Fans quickly voiced their displeasure with the newfangled broadcast and its glitches  and not just because they couldn t watch their teams as they normally would  the Mets on SportsNet New York and the Phillies on Comcast SportsNet Philadelphia Several viewers complained that the onscreen scoreboard and statistics banner blocked too much of the screen  as did the comments bar on the side  And in the fifth inning  as the broadcast showed a montage of the Mets  oft injured captain David Wright  the feed froze Much like any new way of viewing sports  this debut broadcast appealed to some fans and estranged others  I m standing in my kitchen watching on my cellphone because it wasn t working well on my TV   Mike Schulman  a high school teacher on Long Island  said by telephone during the ninth inning of the Mets  4 2 victory   It worked but it was lagging  The image got really pixelated at points  It worked fine on my cellphone and laptop  Some lag time could be attributed to the speed of viewers  internet connections or cellphone data  but the glitch in the fifth inning on Facebook Watch  as the platform s video service is called  was a widespread technical problem  It was quickly fixed  We re still in the early days of having live sports on Facebook Watch and are learning with every broadcast we have on the platform   a Facebook spokesman said in a statement   Fortunately  we have a great partner in Major League Baseball innovating on our platform and listening to feedback from fans to adjust the broadcast in real time  M L B  added in a statement   Today marked a historic and important step as we experiment with new platforms for fans to watch games  Our fans provided great feedback throughout their experiences today  which will continue to help us as we present these social first broadcasts on Facebook each week  The viewing experience for the Mets Phillies game was certainly different  Instead of the traditional commercial breaks in between half innings  there were short segments about players and teams  and interviews with Mets pitcher Matt Harvey and the comedian Jim Breuer  a Mets fan  At times during game action  a viewer s comment would be highlighted on a banner across the top of the screen  I know they re trying to bring in a new audience  but I don t think that s the best way to bring them in   Schulman said After receiving many complaints  producers of the stream told viewers how to hide the comments bar via the comment section  as well as on the broadcast itself  They also reduced the size of the onscreen graphics  which were originally designed for cellphone screens Of the big four professionals sports leagues in the United States  M L B  has the audience that skews the oldest  A study by Magna Global  a marketing research company  found that the average age of television viewers of M L B  in 2016 was 57 Schulman considers himself to be part of the target audience for M L B   he is 30 years old and a die hard fan of the Mets  His television wasn t compatible with the Facebook app  but he figured out how to use a different streaming device Although he and his 60 year old father are Facebook users  Schulman said his father struggled to load the game  so he had to walk him through directions on the phone during the game   For me it was fine  but for an older man or woman who is not as tech savvy  might be more difficult   Schulman said Nearly 69 000 comments streamed across the bar on the side of the viewing screen  They ranged from harsh criticism to compliments for the teams and players  as well as complaints about the broadcast and even about privacy concerns facing Facebook  Viewers said they were watching from as far away as Sweden  Watching on the train in Queens NY  Loving this   wrote one viewer  Why did syndergaard leave early   asked another  Worst viewing experience ever   a different viewer said M L B  first aired a handful of games on Facebook last year  using the local broadcast s feed on the social media platform  Last month  M L B  announced that 25 games this season would be produced by MLB Network and its broadcasters solely for Facebook Watch  joining a wave of new broadcasting efforts in live sports by companies like Twitter and Amazon  Facebook reportedly paid over  30 million for the games The deal means that fans who usually tune in to their local regional cable network or have purchased M L B  s smartphone At Bat app or MLB TV service cannot watch the 25 Facebook broadcast games there The attendance and ratings are usually lighter for a midweek day game early in the season  and the hour and forty five minute rain delay on Wednesday most likely didn t help  The Mets announced a paid crowd of 21 328 people  At one point  over 80 000 viewers watched the Facebook broadcast Next week  the St  Louis Cardinals and Milwaukee Brewers will get their turn on Facebook 
Cambridge Analytica  the political data firm with ties to President Trump s 2016 campaign  suspended its chief executive  Alexander Nix  on Tuesday  amid the furor over the access it gained to private information on more than 50 million Facebook users The decision came after a television broadcast in which Mr  Nix was recorded suggesting that the company had used seduction and bribery to entrap politicians and influence foreign elections The suspension represented a new low point for the fortunes of Cambridge Analytica and for Mr  Nix  who spent much of the past year making bold claims about the role his outfit played in the election of Mr  Trump  The company  founded by Stephen K  Bannon and Robert Mercer  a wealthy Republican donor who has put at least  15 million into it  offered tools that it claimed could identify the personalities of American voters and influence their behavior So called psychographic modeling techniques  which were built in part with the data harvested from Facebook  underpinned Cambridge Analytica s work for the Trump campaign in 2016  Mr  Nix once called the practice  our secret sauce   though some have questioned its effectiveness But in recent days  the firm has found itself under increased scrutiny from lawmakers  regulators and prosecutors in the United States and Britain following reports in The New York Times and The Observer of London that the firm had harvested the Facebook data  and that it still had a copy of the information The reports quickly put Mr  Nix in the cross hairs of a parliamentary committee investigating fake news and Russian interference in Britain s referendum to exit the European Union  Earlier this month  he told the committee that Cambridge Analytica had never obtained or used Facebook data   a statement that the firm itself has contradicted in recent days But it was Monday s broadcast by Channel 4 News in Britain that appeared to push the board of Cambridge Analytica to move against Mr  Nix  Channel 4 spent months investigating the company  and sent a reporter to pose as a prospective client from Sri Lanka  secretly filming the encounters with Mr  Nix The most damning footage was captured in January when Mr  Nix  sitting in a hotel bar in London  suggested the firm could send an attractive woman to seduce a rival candidate and secretly videotape the encounter  or send someone posing as a wealthy land developer to pass a bribe  We have a long history of working behind the scenes   Mr  Nix said Inside Cambridge Analytica  Mr  Nix  the scion of a wealthy family who attended Eton College  the exclusive secondary school  had a reputation for lashing out at staff members  and for aggressively pursuing deals Christopher Wylie  a data expert who worked at the firm in 2013 and 2014 and helped develop its voter profiling technology  said in a recent interview that he kept memberships at a number of exclusive strip clubs near Pall Mall in London at the insistence of Mr  Nix  who often entertained clients from African and Caribbean countries there  Why would I have these memberships   said Mr  Wylie  who is gay   I didn t want them  Channel 4 followed up Tuesday with a second part of its investigation that focused mainly on Mr  Nix s claims that Cambridge Analytica played a pivotal role in the election of Mr  Trump   a claim that many inside the Trump campaign have disputed The Channel 4 report also included allegations first reported by The Times this past weekend that Cambridge Analytica s use of foreigners to work on election campaigns in the United States could have violated American election laws   The Times did not work with Channel 4  Announcing its chief executive s suspension  Cambridge Analytica said in a statement that  in the view of the board  Mr  Nix s recent comments secretly recorded by Channel 4 and other allegations do not represent the values or operations of the firm and his suspension reflects the seriousness with which we view this violation  The company said it had asked Alexander Tayler  its chief data officer  to serve as its acting chief executive  Mr  Tayler trained as a chemical engineer and joined Cambridge Analytica in 2014 as its lead data scientist  according to his LinkedIn profile At the same time  the company said it was initiating an  independent investigation  of Mr  Nix s comments and the allegations facing the firm The company said it had hired a lawyer  Julian Malins   to lead this investigation  the findings of which the board will share publicly in due course  It added   The board will be monitoring the situation closely  working closely with Dr  Tayler  to ensure that Cambridge Analytica  in all of its operations  represents the firm s values and delivers the highest quality service to its clients  It was not immediately clear what impact Mr  Nix s resignation would have on the SCL Group  the parent company of Cambridge Analytica  The companies were set up with a convoluted corporate structure  and their operations are deeply intertwined Mr  Nix  for instance  holds dual appointments at the two companies  Cambridge Analytica is registered in Delaware and almost wholly owned by the Mercer family  but it is effectively a shell   it holds intellectual property rights to its psychographic modeling tools  yet its clients are served by the staff at London based SCL and overseen by Mr  Nix  who is a British citizen Neither the Mercer family nor Mr  Bannon has publicly commented since the reports in the Times and The Observer Facebook  too  has sought to avoid the spotlight but also found itself under a similarly unwelcome glare  In the United States  the Federal Trade Commission said on Tuesday that it had opened an investigation into whether Facebook violated an agreement with the agency on data privacy In addition  Eric T  Schneiderman  the attorney general of New York  said the state was joining Massachusetts in an investigation into whether the company failed to protect the privacy of users in those states  Their attorneys general have demanded that Facebook hand over information about its interactions with Cambridge Analytica  Consumers have a right to know how their information is used   and companies like Facebook have a fundamental responsibility to protect their users  personal information   Mr  Schneiderman said In Britain  Damian Collins  the chairman of the Digital  Culture  Media and Sport Select Committee of the House of Commons  which is running the inquiry into fake news  called on Mark Zuckerberg  Facebook s chief executive  to give evidence to Parliament In a letter  Mr  Collins said that previous answers from Facebook officials about the misuse of data had been  misleading   It is now time to hear from a senior Facebook executive with the sufficient authority to give an accurate account of this catastrophic failure of process   the letter said  adding   I hope that this representative will be you

WELLINGTON  New Zealand    New Zealand s privacy commissioner said Wednesday that Facebook broke the law by not releasing information to a man who wanted to know what others were saying about him on the social network Commissioner John Edwards said Facebook refused the man access to personal information that was held on the accounts of several Facebook users  Edwards said the company claimed it wasn t bound by New Zealand s privacy laws and didn t have to comply with a request from his office to take a look at the disputed information Facebook said Edwards had made a  broad and intrusive  request for private data  and that the company was protecting its users  We are disappointed that the New Zealand privacy commissioner asked us to provide access to a year s worth of private data belonging to several people and then criticized us for protecting their privacy   the company said in a statement The commissioner s finding allows the man to seek financial damages against Facebook  The man wasn t named and it wasn t immediately clear whether he would pursue damages The case also raises jurisdictional questions  Edwards said Facebook should comply by New Zealand laws but the company was arguing it s not bound by them because its operation is based in Ireland Edwards said Facebook has 2 5 million users in New Zealand  about half of the nation s population  and that it takes money from New Zealand businesses  We don t believe there s any credible question that it s operating in New Zealand and is subject to New Zealand laws   he said Facebook didn t address the jurisdictional question in its statement The company said it had investigated the man s complaint but hadn t got enough detail to resolve it  Facebook said it scrutinized all requests to disclose personal data  particularly the contents of private messages  and would continue to challenge those that were too broad  We have a long history of working with the commissioner  and we will continue to request information that will help us investigate this complaint further   the company said One course of action for Facebook would be to challenge the commissioner s findings in court  The company did not immediately respond to questions about whether it would pursue legal action

The news that Facebook s Android app has been collecting call and text histories is yet another black eye for the social media giant  But just why was Facebook able to siphon off records of who its users were contacting   and when   in the first place The short answer  Because Google let it  The longer answer  Well  it s complicated The social network acknowledged on Sunday that it began uploading call and text logs from phones running Google s Android system in 2015   first via its Messenger app and later through an option in Facebook Lite  a stripped down version of its main app  Facebook added that only users who gave appropriate permission were affected  that it didn t collect the contents of messages or calls  and that users can opt out of the data collection and have the stored logs deleted by changing their app settings Facebook did not respond to multiple requests for more specifics  The kerfuffle over this data collection  first reported by the website Ars Technica   follows a week of turmoil for the social network involving charges that it allowed political consultants to steal the data of 50 million users in order to influence elections There s a reason Facebook s actions were restricted to Android phones  Apple locks down app permissions tightly  which offers more privacy protection to iPhone users   Apple s fundamental approach is to collect the minimum amount of information to keep the service running  and keep customers in control of the information   said Rich Mogull  CEO of the security firm Securosis But Android has long been more indulgent Until recently  in fact  Google let app developers gain access to a phone s call and text logs  All they needed was an app that required access to user contacts  Once users agreed  Android would then also grant access to those communication histories Starting in 2012 with its  Jelly Bean  release  Android would notify people installing such apps that they were also giving apps access to their call and text logs  but still required them to agree to all those permissions at once  Rejecting the request meant the apps wouldn t work It wasn t until 2015 when Google released Android 6 0  dubbed  Marshmallow   that Android phones finally split up those permissions  That meant users could agree to share contacts  but reject access to their messaging and phone histories That s the same year Facebook says its apps started collecting this information  But many Android users aren t using the latest version of the software  In fact  they often can t get it even if they want it Apple owns both the software and hardware for iPhones  which allows it to push out new versions of its iOS operating software at will  Google  by contrast  is largely at the mercy of both mobile carriers and hardware makers when it comes to distributing new Android versions There are nearly 20 000 Android phone models now in service  and carriers like to tweak the software for each to ensure that it will work as smoothly as possible on their networks  As a result  new Android versions reach users very slowly As of January  about 65 percent of iPhone users were using the latest iOS software  introduced in 2017  Less than 1 percent of Android devices currently use the latest version of Android  known as  Oreo    Many of them are owners of Google s new Pixel phones  which get software updates directly from Google  Just over half of all Android users are using the two previous versions  which allow them to specifically reject the sharing of communication logs  Last October  Google began forcing all apps to follow the new rules when they issue updates  even on phones running older versions of Android All that leaves two big questions unanswered  Why did Google set up Android permissions this way  And how many other apps have taken advantages of the same setup Experts and privacy advocates say the answer to the first question is probably related to Google s advertising based business model  which   like Facebook   depends on collecting detailed information about users in order to target them with tailored ads  Apple  meanwhile  derives its profits from the sale of devices and services like Apple Music Another possible factor  Android was playing catch up with Apple for many years  and was eager to attract app developers in order to attain parity with Apple s App Store  Some app developers may have found greater access to user data on Android attractive   as Facebook did Experts say it s not clear if other apps are going as far as Facebook in terms of tracking call history and texts  but it s very possible  In a lot of ways  Facebook is the tip of the iceberg   said Bob O Donnell  chief analyst at Technalysis Research   There are plenty of other people doing this kind of data collection  It is unclear how many apps gained access to call logs so far or how many users  call logs had been sent to app developers  A Google spokesperson declined to comment One major Android phone maker expressed uncertainty over its role in protecting user privacy   At this time the nature of the data breach is unclear so it is difficult to comment on the cause or the solution   LG Electronics Inc  said Tuesday in a statement    AP Technology Writer Youkyung Lee in Seoul  South Korea  contributed to this report

Should Facebook pay us for our puppy pictures Of course  the idea sounds crazy  Posting puppies on Facebook is not a chore  We love it  Facebook s 1 4 billion daily users spend the better part of an hour on it every day  It s amazing that we don t have to pay for it And yet the idea is gaining momentum in Silicon Valley and beyond  Facebook and the other technological Goliaths offering free online services   from which they harvest data from and about their users   should pay for every nugget of information they reap The spring break pictures on Instagram  the YouTube video explaining Minecraft tactics  the internet searches and the Amazon purchases  even your speed following Waze on the way to spend Thanksgiving with your in laws   this data is valuable  It will become more valuable  potentially much more so  in the not too distant future Getting companies to pay transparently for the information will not just provide a better deal for the users whose data is scooped up as they go about their online lives  It will also improve the quality of the data on which the information economy is being built  And it could undermine the data titans  stranglehold on technology s future  breathing fresh air into an economy losing its vitality The idea has been around for a bit  Jaron Lanier  the tech philosopher and virtual reality pioneer who now works for Microsoft Research  proposed it in his 2013 book   Who Owns the Future    as a needed corrective to an online economy mostly financed by advertisers  covert manipulation of users  consumer choices It is being picked up in  Radical Markets   a book due out shortly from Eric A  Posner of the University of Chicago Law School and E  Glen Weyl  principal researcher at Microsoft  And it is playing into European efforts to collect tax revenue from American internet giants In a report obtained last month by Politico  the European Commission proposes to impose a tax on the revenue of digital companies based on their users  location  on the grounds that  a significant part of the value of a business is created where the users are based and data is collected and processed  Users  data is a valuable commodity  Facebook offers advertisers precisely targeted audiences based on user profiles  YouTube  too  uses users  preferences to tailor its feed  Still  this pales in comparison with how valuable data is about to become  as the footprint of artificial intelligence extends across the economy Data is the crucial ingredient of the A I  revolution  Training systems to perform even relatively straightforward tasks like voice translation  voice transcription or image recognition requires vast amounts of data   like tagged photos  to identify their content  or recordings with transcriptions  Among leading A I  teams  many can likely replicate others  software in  at most  one to two years   notes the technologist Andrew Ng   But it is exceedingly difficult to get access to someone else s data  Thus data  rather than software  is the defensible barrier for many businesses  We may think we get a fair deal  offering our data as the price of sharing puppy pictures  By other metrics  we are being victimized  In the largest technology companies  the share of income going to labor is only about 5 to 15 percent  Mr  Posner and Mr  Weyl write  That s way below Walmart s 80 percent  Consumer data amounts to work they get free  If these A I  driven companies represent the future of broader parts of the economy   they argue   without something basic changing in their business model  we may be headed for a world where labor s share falls dramatically from its current roughly 70 percent to something closer to 20 to 30 percent  As Mr  Lanier  Mr  Posner and Mr  Weyl point out  it is ironic that humans are providing free data to train the artificial intelligence systems to replace workers across the economy  Commentators from both left and right fret over how ordinary people will put food on the table once robots take all the jobs  Perhaps a universal basic income  funded by taxes  is the answer How about paying people for the data they produced to train the robots  If A I  accounted for 10 percent of the economy and the big data companies paid two thirds of their income for data   the same as labor s share of income across the economy   the share of income going to  workers  would rise drastically  By Mr  Weyl and Mr  Posner s reckoning  the median household of four would gain  20 000 a year A critical consideration is that if people were paid for their data  its quality and value would increase  Facebook could directly ask users to tag the puppy pictures to train the machines  It could ask translators to upload their translations  Facebook and Google could demand quality information if the value of the transaction were more transparent  Unwilling to enter in a direct quid pro quo with their users  the data titans must make do with whatever their users submit The transition would not be painless  We would need to figure out systems to put value on data  Your puppy pictures might turn out to be worthless  but that college translation from Serbo Croatian could be valuable  Barred from free data  YouTube and Facebook might charge a user fee for their service   like Netflix  Alternatively  they might make their money from training A I  systems and pay some royalty stream to the many people whose data helped train them But whatever the cost  the transformation seems worthwhile  Notably  it could help resolve one of the most relevant questions coming into focus in this new technological age  Who will control the data Today  the dominant data harvesters in the business are Google and Facebook  with Amazon  Apple and Microsoft some way behind  Their dominance cannot really be challenged  Could you think of a rival search engine  Could another social network replace the one all your friends are on  This dominance might matter less if companies had to pay for their users  data Google and Facebook and Amazon would not be able to extend the network effects that cemented their place at the top of the technology ecosystem to the world of A I  Everybody wants to be on Facebook because everybody s friends are on Facebook  But this dominance could be eroded if rivals made direct offers of money for data Companies with different business models might join the fray   This is an opportunity for other companies to enter and say look  we will pay you for this data   Mr  Posner said   All this is so new that ordinary people haven t figured out how manipulated they are by these companies  The big question  of course  is how we get there from here  My guess is that it would be naïve to expect Google and Facebook to start paying for user data of their own accord  even if that improved the quality of the information  Could policymakers step in  somewhat the way the European Commission did  demanding that technology companies compute the value of consumer data In any event  there is probably a better deal out there  in your future  than giving Facebook free puppy pictures 
Nearly all applicants for a visa to enter the United States   an estimated 14 7 million people a year   will be asked to submit their social media user names for the past five years  under proposed rules that the State Department issued on Friday Last September  the Trump administration announced that applicants for immigrant visas would be asked for social media data  a plan that would affect 710 000 people or so a year  The new proposal would vastly expand that order to cover some 14 million people each year who apply for nonimmigrant visas The proposal covers 20 social media platforms  Most of them are based in the United States  Facebook  Flickr  Google   Instagram  LinkedIn  Myspace  Pinterest  Reddit  Tumblr  Twitter  Vine and YouTube  But several are based overseas  the Chinese sites Douban  QQ  Sina Weibo  Tencent Weibo and Youku  the Russian social network VK  Twoo  which was created in Belgium  and Ask fm  a question and answer platform based in Latvia During his campaign  President Trump promised  extreme vetting  of people seeking to enter the United States  and last March the State Department directed consular officers worldwide to step up scrutiny of visa applicants But the new proposal would add a tangible new requirement for millions of people who apply to visit the United States for business or pleasure  including citizens of such countries as Brazil  China  India and Mexico Citizens of roughly 40 countries to which the United States ordinarily grants visa free travel will not be affected by the requirement  Those countries include major allies like Australia  Britain  Canada  France  Germany  Japan and South Korea In addition  visitors traveling on diplomatic and official visas will mostly be exempted As news of the plan emerged on Friday  so did criticism  This attempt to collect a massive amount of information on the social media activity of millions of visa applicants is yet another ineffective and deeply problematic Trump administration plan   said Hina Shamsi  director of the American Civil Liberties Union s National Security Project   It will infringe on the rights of immigrants and U S  citizens by chilling freedom of speech and association  particularly because people will now have to wonder if what they say online will be misconstrued or misunderstood by a government official  Anil Kalhan  an associate professor of law at Drexel University who works on immigration and international human rights  wrote on Twitter   This is unnecessarily intrusive and beyond ridiculous  Facebook said its position had not changed since last year  when it said   We oppose any efforts to force travelers at the border to turn over their private account information  including passwords  Along with the social media information  visa applicants will be asked for past passport numbers  phone numbers and email addresses  for records of international travel  whether they have been deported or removed  or violated immigration law  in the past  and whether relatives have been involved in terrorist activities  Maintaining robust screening standards for visa applicants is a dynamic practice that must adapt to emerging threats   the State Department said in a statement   We already request limited contact information  travel history  family member information  and previous addresses from all visa applicants  Collecting this additional information from visa applicants will strengthen our process for vetting these applicants and confirming their identity  Millions of people each year complete the online application for a nonimmigrant visa  known as the DS 160  It takes about 90 minutes to fill out  according to the department The San Bernardino  Calif   terrorist attack in 2015  which killed 14 people  focused attention on immigrants  social media use  after officials acknowledged that they had missed signs of online radicalization in an online messaging platform used by the husband and wife who carried out the attack Last year  John F  Kelly  who was then the secretary of homeland security and is now Mr  Trump s chief of staff  told members of Congress that his department was considering asking visitors for passwords and access to online accounts  We want to get on their social media  with passwords   Mr  Kelly told members of the House Homeland Security Committee   If they don t want to cooperate  then you don t come in  So far  the government has stopped short of demanding passwords  though travelers have reported being asked for them  on a sporadic basis  at airports and other ports of entry  By some measures  the number of international visitors to the United States has begun to slip  although foreign tourism to New York City set a record last year The new State Department requirements will not take effect immediately  The proposal set off a 60 day period for public comment  which ends on May 29 On Sina Weibo  one of China s largest social media platforms  several users were critical of the plan  Does it mean someone s visa application will likely be rejected if he she has been critical of the U S    one wrote   What about your sacred  freedom of speech   Another user wrote   We Chinese have learned well enough the lessons to be drawn from isolation  Now it s America s turn  
SHANGHAI   Within its digital borders  China has long censored what its people read and say online  Now  it is increasingly going beyond its own online realms to police what people and companies are saying about it all over the world For years  China has exerted digital control with a system of internet filters known as the Great Firewall  which allows authorities to limit what people see online  To broaden its censorship efforts  Beijing is venturing outside the Great Firewall and paying more attention to what its citizens are saying on non Chinese apps and services As part of that shift  Beijing has at times pressured foreign companies like Google and Facebook  which are both blocked in China  to take down certain content  At other times  it has bypassed foreign companies entirely and instead directly pushed users of global social media to encourage self censorship This effort is accelerating as President Xi Jinping consolidates his power  The Chinese leadership is expected to officially abolish term limits at a meeting that begins next week  giving Mr  Xi outsize authority over the country s direction Zhang Guanghong recently discovered the changing landscape for technology firsthand  Mr  Zhang  a Chinese human rights activist  decided last fall to share an article with a group of friends in and outside China that criticized China s president  To do so  he used WhatsApp  an American app owned by Facebook that almost nobody uses in China In September  Mr  Zhang was detained in China  he is expected to soon be charged with insulting China s government and the Communist Party  The evidence  according to his lawyer  included printouts of what Mr  Zhang shared and said in the WhatsApp group That information was likely obtained by hacking his phone or through a spy in his group chat  said China tech experts  without involving WhatsApp  Mr  Zhang s case is one of the first known examples of Chinese authorities using conversations from a non Chinese chat app as evidence   and it sends a warning to those on the American platform  which is encrypted  that they could also be held accountable for what s said there  China is increasingly throwing its weight around   said Joshua Rosenzweig  an analyst at Amnesty International As Mr  Xi asserts himself and the primacy of Chinese geopolitical power  China has also become more comfortable projecting Mr  Xi s vision of a tightly controlled internet  Beijing had long been content to block foreign internet companies and police the homegrown alternatives that sprouted up to take their place  but it is now directly pressuring individuals or requesting that companies cooperate with its online censorship efforts That puts many American tech giants in a tricky position  especially those that want access to China s vast internet market of more than 700 million strong  In the past  these companies have typically gone to great lengths to gain a toehold in China  Facebook created a censorship tool it did not use and released an app in the country without putting its name to it  Apple is moving data storage for its Chinese customers into China and last year took down software that skirts China s internet blocks from its China App Store  Google recently said it would open a new artificial intelligence lab in the country Often  these companies have little recourse when pressured for help by Beijing  Going to the American government could set off retaliation from China  so many have sought to navigate the situation on their own  I personally am not sure what the solution is for these companies   said Mr  Rosenzweig   I don t see a good answer because the Chinese government is really putting them between a rock and a hard place  China leaned heavily on major internet companies when Guo Wengui  a Chinese tycoon in self imposed exile  went on Facebook and YouTube to accuse a number of Chinese officials of corruption  Chinese officials last year complained to Google  which owns YouTube  and Facebook  according to people familiar with the events who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the issue publicly Facebook suspended Mr  Guo s account  In a statement  the company said the account published the personal information of others without their consent  which violated the platform s policies  A spokeswoman declined to comment on whether Beijing s complaints played a role Chinese authorities have also successfully persuaded Google to pull down content that had been available around the globe The Chinese government asked Google s services to take down 2 290 items in the first half of last year  according to the company s statistics  That was more than triple the number it requested in the second half of 2016  which itself had set a record Content related to terrorism made up a substantial portion of the material China asked Google to take down  according to its data  The majority of China s recent takedown requests focused on videos on YouTube  the data showed  A Google spokesman said the company would not comment further on specific takedown requests Chinese officials may have even bigger censorship ambitions At a major Chinese internet conference last year  Mei Jianming  a Chinese antiterrorism expert  said Beijing should put more pressure on companies like Twitter  The goal would be to get them to change their terms of service so they could restrict posts by groups that Beijing considers subversive  like the World Uyghur Congress  which seeks self determination for the people of the western Chinese region of Xinjiang Mr  Mei called for a crackdown on tweets that  defame the party  Chinese leaders  and related national strategies  Sometimes  Chinese people also push foreign companies to censor themselves in the country  nurtured by sentiments on China s propaganda channels Daimler  the German carmaker  apologized in February after its Mercedes Benz brand posted an inspirational quote on Facebook s Instagram that it attributed to the Dalai Lama  China s government views the Tibetan Buddhist leader as a champion of independence for Tibet  and Mercedes Benz faced withering criticism from Chinese online users who shared those views Mercedes Benz erased the post   even though few people in China could see it because Chinese authorities block Instagram  Still  criticism continued  The People s Daily  the official newspaper of the Communist Party  branded Mercedes Benz an  enemy of the people  China is Mercedes Benz s biggest single car market  accounting for about one quarter of sales  China is getting stronger   said Lokman Tsui  a professor at the School of Journalism and Communication at the Chinese University of Hong Kong  and a former Google employee   They re getting more confident in putting pressure on these platforms  China is also requiring individuals to police what they say on global social media  In a prominent conviction last year of a human rights activist  Lee Ming che  the Chinese police used writing that he had posted on Facebook from Taiwan as evidence against him  The fact that China is punishing people for critical content published outside China to audiences not based in China is of course a concern   said Mr  Rosenzweig The case of Mr  Zhang  the Chinese individual under scrutiny for what he posted on WhatsApp  could indicate a further extension of China s reach The Chinese police have previously focused on activists for what they say on foreign social media  but Mr  Zhang s case seems to be one of the first in which someone has been charged for spreading articles on WhatsApp  Because WhatsApp is encrypted and run by a foreign company  it is generally considered a safer platform than local messaging app WeChat  which has for years been closely monitored by Chinese authorities Mr  Zhang s lawyer  Sui Muqing  said he was surprised when the police presented him with printouts of articles and comments from Mr  Zhang  They didn t get the information from him  but they have it   Mr  Sui said   That was what we found so weird  None of us knew how they were capable of getting that data and whether WhatsApp has become unsafe  Experts said the information was likely gleaned from somebody within Mr  Zhang s WhatsApp group or by accessing Mr  Zhang s phone directly  not by hacking WhatsApp  Chinese officials formally blocked WhatsApp in China about the time of Mr  Zhang s detention A spokeswoman for WhatsApp said Chinese authorities did not have backdoor access to its encrypted messages  China s Ministry of Public Security did not respond to requests for comment  When I talk about technology and the internet  people normally pine for them and look forward to a future that will promote liberalization   Mr  Sui said   But people neglect the fact that modern authoritarianism also rises with the development of technology  which makes wider and deeper control possible  
You may be reeling from revelations that the private Facebook data of millions unwittingly got in the hands of a voter profiling firm with ties to President Trump  And you may be weighing the pros and cons of deleting your social media accounts altogether But before you go there  ask yourself a simpler question  Why do you hoard so much data on social networks in the first place For many of us  our timeline of posts has piled up since we signed up for Facebook and Twitter  While the social networks portray their products as time capsules of your fondest memories and conversations  the experience of poring through past posts is more like rummaging through a digital junk drawer of good  bad and ugly moments  And the hoarded data is just sitting out there for others to see  including potential employers who are doing background checks and any enemies who may be trying to dig up something against us So why keep eternal timelines I posed my question to Zizi Papacharissi  a professor of communication at the University of Illinois Chicago who teaches courses on social media  She said many of us leave up our timeline of posts because Facebook and Twitter don t make it simple to clean them up  There s no button to set ablaze a large swath of content  like a year s worth or even a month s worth of posts  So we leave everything  including silly comments from our college years and rants we made when we were angry about politics or other matters  If you say something online  it has a different kind of permanence   Ms  Papacharissi cautioned   It s always there to haunt you  So over the last two months  I decided to do something different by trying to erase that permanence  Specifically  I used web tools to eradicate the vast majority of my Facebook and Twitter posts  Those turned out to be impractical and tedious to use   though automated  the programs were flawed and missed many posts after several attempts  The chore took about five hours  spread out over weeks While I walked away from the ashes of my digital self feeling less haunted  I confess my methods may not be worth the trouble  though there are other  more practical solutions  Yet cleaning up your timeline is an exercise I recommend in moderation if you care about your privacy Here s how I did it   and what I learned Since Facebook and Twitter offer no simple method for doing a mass purging of timelines  you will likely have to rely on third party tools  I picked two well reviewed programs  TweetDelete for cleaning up my Twitter account and Social Book Post Manager for handling my Facebook account TweetDelete was simple to put to work  It s a web app you install by visiting the tool s website  tweetdelete net  and authorizing the application to connect with your Twitter account From there  you can choose to delete tweets that are more than a week old  The app takes a few minutes to delete large batches of your tweets  One major caveat  Because of a technical limitation  TweetDelete can delete only the last 3 200 tweets on your account  So to clear out roughly 14 000 tweets that were more than a year old  I had to run the app four times   I ve had a lot to say on Twitter over the last decade  O K   My Facebook timeline was tougher to manage  After skimming my last 14 years  worth of Facebook posts  I concluded there was nothing worth keeping  So I opted to purge everything I installed Social Book Post Manager  a free add on for the Chrome web browser  This app was more rudimentary  It essentially scrolled through my timeline and clicked on the  delete  button for each of my posts for me Social Book Post Manager lets you delete months  or years  worth of content   or everything  which I chose  The problem was  even after I used the app to scrub through my entire timeline six times  the tool missed about a dozen posts  There is a setting to adjust the speed at which the app deletes posts  and I had to choose the minimum speed to do a complete purge The process was agonizing  I watched years of my youth play back in slow motion  including dated  satirical jokes and photos of myself wearing vintage clothing back when that was a fashion trend  before the tool deleted each post one at a time After I finished scrubbing my Facebook timeline  I concluded that my delete everything approach was probably not worth most people s time  And even after all that time  my Facebook timeline was still decorated with posts that my friends had published about me   including photos from my 21st birthday  need I say more     because that content was not mine to delete Gennie Gebhart  a researcher who follows privacy and surveillance issues for the Electronic Frontier Foundation  a digital rights nonprofit  found a simpler approach  She connected her Facebook and Twitter accounts with the app Timehop To help people reminisce  Timehop every day surfaces photos and posts published from years past on Twitter and Facebook  Ms  Gebhart uses the tool to incrementally audit her timeline to see if there was something from the past she might not want lingering around She said that she rarely found posts worth deleting  but that most people might enjoy this light exercise for peace of mind   and to protect their public reputations Facebook representatives said that based on feedback  the company recognized that people had different needs for managing their timelines  So it offers a privacy setting for people to limit the visibility of their older timeline posts  Similar to Timehop  Facebook also occasionally surfaces old memories from people s timelines to help them reminisce Twitter did not respond to requests for comment Beyond the technological difficulties of doing a social media purge  you may decide it s not right for you  Ms  Papacharissi  the communication professor  said people formed sentimental attachments to their memories on social media  as they do with clothing and old photographs  They present a timeline of who we were  of who we are now and who we would like to be   she said   It s like this always on story  It s difficult to disconnect that  
Alex Stamos  the Facebook executive who plans to leave the company by August amid a backlash over disinformation  has not been one to hold back Mr  Stamos  Facebook s chief information security officer  was often known to push superiors on security matters beyond where they were comfortable  people who have worked with him have said  He once challenged the National Security Agency director to his face  sparred with the media on Twitter and took his former bosses at Yahoo   and more recently at Facebook   to task over security issues At times  Mr  Stamos s outspokenness made him an asset  But it also made him a nuisance in Silicon Valley  where tech executives publicly praise a spirit of openness even as many of them become more opaque At Facebook  Mr  Stamos favored more disclosure about how Russian agents used the site to influence the 2016 presidential election and beyond  He also pushed for organizational changes to better prevent misinformation  But Mr  Stamos  39  was met with resistance and now plans to leave the company just ahead of the midterm election  It is a hard decision  weighing the potential future good you might do in an organization vs  how likely they will let it happen   Jeff Moss  founder of the Black Hat and DefCon cybersecurity conferences  posted about Mr  Stamos on Twitter   Put another way  You can eat well or sleep well  but seldom both   Facebook did not have a comment for this article and referred to Mr  Stamos s previous comments and his posts on Twitter  On Tuesday  Mr  Stamos tweeted that Facebook executives  including the chief executive  Mark Zuckerberg  and the chief operating officer  Sheryl Sandberg   supported the investigation and disclosure of our work  and I m glad we put out what we found   He did not address the disputes over the reorganization of Facebook s security team Mr  Stamos  a California native and a graduate of the University of California  Berkeley  previously worked at start ups and founded a security consulting firm in San Francisco before joining Yahoo as its chief security officer in mid 2014 He became somewhat of a legend in 2015 when he pushed back on government efforts to weaken security  At the time  after surveillance disclosures by the former National Security Agency contractor Edward J  Snowden  Silicon Valley companies were adding anti surveillance protections including encryption to their data centers and messaging tools  Washington accused tech companies of going too far  and the F B I  pressed companies like Apple to weaken their encryption or build in a government back door In February 2015  at a cybersecurity conference in Washington  Mr  Stamos stood up to Adm  Michael S  Rogers  the N S A  director  by likening the government s requests to  drilling a hole in the windshield   A video of the encounter went viral  making Mr  Stamos a celebrated figure in privacy and security circles Within Yahoo s security team  known as the  Paranoids   Mr  Stamos was considered an inspiration by many of its young engineers  But his vocal   at times abrasive   advocacy for privacy and anti surveillance measures often put him at odds with Yahoo s leadership  including the chief executive  Marissa Mayer Mr  Stamos had successfully campaigned for Yahoo to encrypt the data flowing through its data centers  But when he pushed for end to end encryption   which ensures that only the parties in a conversation can see what is being said  leaving even Yahoo unable to read it   Ms  Mayer and other executives scoffed Some of Mr  Stamos s other security proposals at Yahoo  such as resetting customers  passwords after a breach  were rejected because the added inconvenience might encourage Yahoo customers to leave By then  Mr  Stamos had drawn the notice of Facebook executives  Some at the social network worried aloud whether he was too much of a firebrand to join the social network  according to three current and former Facebook employees who declined to be named because of nondisclosure agreements  But others argued that his activism was a benefit for the company Mr  Stamos joined Facebook in June 2015  From the start  the current and former employees said  he got off on the wrong foot with some executives  including Ms  Sandberg  over how best to police the platform  Facebook was increasingly grappling with cyberattacks from countries like Iran  whose hackers were caught trying to break into the accounts of State Department employees  and from Russia  the current and former employees said In a statement on Monday  Mr  Stamos said his relationship with Ms  Sandberg was  productive  After a breach of the Democratic National Committee in June 2016  Mr  Stamos pulled together a team to investigate Russian interference on Facebook  The findings pit him against executives in the company s legal and communications groups  While Mr  Stamos argued to disclose more  others said that by proactively disclosing what they had found  Facebook had become a target of further public ire  according to seven current and former Facebook employees Internally  Mr  Stamos repeatedly argued that Facebook needed to act more like a defense contractor in dealing with security  given that the social network was becoming a similar target for nation states In audio leaked in October to ZDNet  a tech news site  he told his security team that he explained to management  that we have the threat profile of a Northrop Grumman or a Raytheon or another defense contractor  but we run our corporate network  for example  like a college campus  almost  The tape infuriated Mr  Stamos s bosses  according to the current and former employees  A leak investigation is continuing  two of the people said  They said some executives believed Mr  Stamos had leaked the audio himself to get Facebook to take his entreaties more seriously Mr  Stamos later tweeted that the audio was  not a criticism of anybody  just a statement of why our team needs to be creative in how we protect our corporate network  By October  the relationship between Mr  Stamos and Ms  Sandberg had deteriorated over how to handle Russian interference on Facebook and how best to reorganize Facebook s security team before the midterm elections  according to more than half a dozen people who work or formerly worked at the company  Mr  Stamos proposed that instead of reporting to Facebook s general counsel  Colin Stretch  he report directly to Facebook s higher ups Instead  executives released Mr  Stamos from much of his day to day responsibility  employees said Mr  Stamos has said his remaining days at Facebook will be spent  exploring emerging risks and working on election security  
The laid back companies of Silicon Valley are known for corporate headquarters that resemble universities  where employees mingle with tourists taking selfies and collaborations take shape out on the quad At the Google campus in Mountain View  Calif   employees say the co founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin stroll between meetings without an obvious security detail  and locals make off with the free bicycles for employees But those generous green spaces and relaxed atmospheres come with a trade off  They re difficult to secure Many Google employees love the headquarters  open nature but some worry about it  according to one current and one former Google employee who declined to be named because of a company policy barring workers from speaking to the news media  There is often no barrier between employees and the public  they said  People   most likely other employees   sometimes slip into buildings behind workers with badges  they said  and neither had ever seen an armed guard on campus  Google declined to comment The shooting this week at the headquarters of YouTube  a Google owned company about 25 miles north in San Bruno  has highlighted the security risks of Silicon Valley s relatively open corporate campuses   particularly as tech companies  expanding influence angers more people online But the risk is not confined to the tech sector  Many companies across the country are similarly exposed  reflecting an open door policy that for generations has pervaded corporate America  where safety training has long focused on fire drills  earthquake sheltering procedures and accident cleanup Some of that trust has eroded over the years  After the World Trade Center attacks in 2001  companies fearing terrorist bombings and biochemical attacks taught employees how to handle suspicious packages  But a sharp increase in mass shootings over the past two decades has made companies increasingly nervous about gun violence from disgruntled workers and customers Last year  an employee fatally shot three people at the United Parcel Service complex in San Francisco  In 2016  an employee fatally shot three colleagues and injured 14 more at a lawn care equipment factory in Kansas  In 2012  a man shot seven people and himself at a Minneapolis sign company hours after he was fired  I just don t know how we got here   said James D  Smith  president of the American Society of Safety Engineers   We would never be thinking 10  15 years ago that this would be an issue  On Tuesday  Nasim Najafi Aghdam  a YouTube user upset about the company s policies  shot three people at the company s headquarters before killing herself  police said Ms  Aghdam shot the people in an enclosed courtyard where employees dined  YouTube said she had entered the courtyard through a parking garage  The gate between the parking garage and the courtyard was unlocked  according to Zach Vorhies  an engineer at YouTube  A former YouTube employee who used to handle threats from disgruntled video creators  but was not allowed to speak about it publicly  said his team repeatedly warned YouTube security about the risk of the parking garage and unlocked gate  but it was never fixed YouTube said in a statement on Wednesday that Ms  Aghdam never entered the building itself thanks to other security protections  The company said it was  revisiting this incident in detail  and would be increasing security at all of its offices around the world The F B I  identified 160 so called active shooter incidents in the United States between 2000 and 2013  which left 486 people dead and 557 wounded  Nearly 46 percent of the attacks took place in commercial locations  Dozens of other attacks have occurred since 2013 Workplace shootings have fueled a cottage industry of security consultants who show employees how to manage panic  when to run or hide  and how to fight as a last resort  Lesson plans identify which filing cabinets or pieces of furniture offer the best protection  and which office tools can become improvised weapons  A full day of training can cost companies thousands of dollars Companies are sending their employees to self defense classes and their security personnel to gun ranges to test active shooter threats in virtual reality  Architects are designing offices with designated safe rooms  Insurance providers are offering lower premiums for corporate clients with stronger security  If you can t protect the work force  you re putting your entire operation at risk   said Arnette Heintze  a former Secret Service agent who runs the security consulting firm Hillard Heintze  which posted record revenue in the most recent quarter At Apple s new campus in Cupertino  Calif   visitors are required to enter through a single  guarded entrance  The headquarters have a large courtyard  but reaching it requires someone to pass through the building One former Facebook employee who worked on the company s security protocols  who declined to be named because of Facebook s prohibition on discussing internal company matters  said the company received dozens of threats a week In recent years  Facebook has increased security at the entrances to its headquarters in Menlo Park  Calif   but its parking lots and surrounding areas remain accessible   The safety of our employees is paramount  and we work hard every day to maintain a safe and secure environment for our community   Jamil Walker  a Facebook spokesman  said in an email Facebook could soon find security trickier  It has proposed expanding into a nearby neighborhood  with housing and public space for local residents alongside its offices Some security experts instruct clients to shift their parking lots farther away from the main facility  giving more time for potential attackers to have second thoughts and for guards to act on a threat  Consultants recommend that executive offices remain unlabeled to make them less of a target Companies of all kinds have stepped up security  General Mills said it made physical changes to its building in Minneapolis to better prepare for an active shooter situation  but did not provide specifics  Wendy s said it had installed upgraded security cameras throughout its headquarters in Dublin  Ohio  set up advanced access control systems that can lock down different parts of the facility  and upgraded its phone systems with emergency messaging capabilities Hallmark and Hershey said they show employees a training video from the Center for Personal Protection and Safety that covers active shooter protocol  Some companies use a softer term    hostile intruder    to describe the training  while others add customized introductions to the footage Employees are being asked to download internal apps loaded with safety plans  maps and emergency alerts  Some are told that their bonuses will be withheld if they do not attend mandatory drills And preventive tactics are gaining traction  Employers are hiring social media trackers and data analysts to search for warning signs in employee behavior  Accenture said it has a behavioral threat assessment team made up of human resources representatives  lawyers  on call psychologists and others But security remains a matter of balance  You don t want a security program so restrictive that it hinders the company from doing the business it s in   Mr  Heintze said And vulnerabilities remain common  security consultants said  So called penetration tests frequently show how easily an outsider can slip into an office through the employee smoking area  past an unmonitored camera  into a door held open by a polite employee  or through a metal detector being overseen by an underpaid and overworked security contractor Employees looking for convenience tend to prop open automatically locking doors  Some will pass a badge over a turnstile to a friend who forgot his or hers One corporate client described its facility to John M  White  the chief executive of the Protection Management security consulting firm  as being fully secure  Within three hours  Mr  White found that he could waltz through most of the building s doors without being screened and that some were so old they would not lock Another customer spent several hundred thousand dollars installing security cameras  only to find that their views were obstructed  Mr  White said he has spoken to employees who  in a theoretical attack  said they would be unwilling to break a window to escape out of fear of being fired later  You can t just throw a million dollars at security and say that now the problem s gone   he said   In some ways  it can be a facade   you could have the most secure facility in the world  and there will still be some risks you re going to have to accept and manage  
WASHINGTON   A global attempt to prevent large  multinational companies from shifting their profits to lower tax jurisdictions is setting off a fight between the United States and Europe  as policymakers on both sides of the Atlantic spar over efforts to impose new taxes on foreign firms On Wednesday  the European Commission is expected to take aim at Silicon Valley s tech giants with a proposal to seriously revamp how technology companies are taxed in the 28 nation European Union  The plan  outlined in a draft obtained by The New York Times  would tax digital media companies based on where they generate revenue  rather than where they have their regional headquarters  which are often in countries like Ireland and Luxembourg that have lower tax rates The proposal comes in the wake of the new  1 5 trillion tax law that President Trump signed last year  which tried to crack down on profit shifting by imposing a new minimum tax on the overseas earnings of any companies with United States operations  The international provisions in the United States tax law have angered some European leaders  who say they go too far and may violate World Trade Organization rules The global tensions   and the dueling tax efforts   stem from a shared concern among foreign governments that large  multinational corporations are not paying their fair share of taxes to the countries where they do business  American tech giants like Amazon  Apple and Google have kept their tax bills low for years by keeping profits overseas in lower tax jurisdictions But there is no agreement about how to remedy such tax avoidance  The efforts are exacerbating the already heightened strain between the United States and Europe over a White House plan to impose stiff tariffs on most steel and aluminum imports  Tax and trade have basically merged  as issues between the United States and Europe  said Jay Khosla  the staff director for the Senate Finance Committee The Organisation for Economic Co operation and Development has been trying to coordinate global efforts to combat tax evasion  In a report  on digital taxation issued on Friday  which was separate from the European Union proposal  the organization said that more than 110 countries agreed to review the international tax system  parts of which had been rendered obsolete by the digital economy Officials from the organization said that debate over the proposed European digital tax had been intense at the gathering of the Group of 20 finance ministers in Buenos Aires on Monday  Steven Mnuchin  the United States Treasury secretary  assailed the concept as unfair to American companies  We think that having gross taxes on internet companies is not fair   Mr  Mnuchin said in an interview on the sidelines of the G 20 meeting   It is not the basis of how we think that they should be taxed  and we have been very clear in those discussions  He added   To the extent that there are issues with change in taxation systems regarding physical presence  that needs to be addressed  It should not be a two tiered system where internet companies are taxed under a different standard  Pascal Saint Amans  the director of the O E C D  s Center for Tax Policy and Administration  said that the level of animosity could undermine what had been a coordinated  global effort to crack down on tax avoidance  There are very positive aspects which should be conducive to conversation  but the background is tension  with risks   Mr  Saint Amans said  adding that his organization was trying to ensure that  these countries don t go to war  at a time when there are some worries on that front  The European Union s new tax proposal is expected to hit Silicon Valley tech companies the hardest by forcing them to pay taxes to governments where they do business For example  Amazon operates across the European Union  but lists its regional headquarters as Luxembourg  a tiny country but one with legal loopholes  sweetheart tax deals and low effective corporate taxes  The European Commission estimates that digital businesses pay an average effective tax rate of just 9 5 percent  compared with the 23 3 percent that traditional businesses pay Amazon has been the focus of European officials in the past  Last year  Luxembourg was ordered by the European Union s commissioner for competition  Margrethe Vestager  to collect around 250 million euros  or about  293 million  in unpaid taxes from Amazon Amazon is not alone  European regulators have pressed technology companies on a range of issues  mounting an aggressive campaign against tax avoidance  the mishandling of private data and anti competitive behavior  But that push has prompted complaints from American tech giants  which argue that they are being unfairly singled out by Brussels  European officials strongly deny those claims  arguing that Europe welcomes American technology  but not tax evasion Within the past few years  the European Commission has ordered Apple to pay  13 billion in back taxes and levied fines against other tech giants for abusing their dominant market positions  In January  European antitrust officials fined Qualcomm  the chip maker   997 million for illegally shutting rivals out of the market for certain smartphone and tablet chipsets for more than five years  Qualcomm said it would appeal the ruling Last year  the European Commission fined Google  2 42 billion for using its search engine to favor its own comparison shopping service   called Google Shopping   in search results while demoting results of rival services  Google has appealed the ruling Now  as the European Union prepares to institute comprehensive new data protection rules in May  European regulators have opened a novel line of attack  They are investigating the tech giants  vast information gathering operations as potential anti competitive abuses In December  Germany s federal cartel office said Facebook had abused its dominant position by requiring its users to let the social network  limitlessly amass  data by tracking them through other online services   including the Facebook owned platforms Instagram and WhatsApp  Antitrust regulators said they were  not convinced that users have given their effective consent  to Facebook s data practices and that the extent of the data collection violated mandatory European data protection principles In a blog post  Facebook said that it was cooperating with the German agency  but challenged the claim that it had a dominant position  saying that the social network was merely  popular in Germany   The company also said it would  be working directly with relevant data protection officials  to ensure compliance with the upcoming European data regulation The European Commission s new proposed tax is likely to apply to companies with annual global revenue of more than 750 million euros  or about  925 million  and cover sales generated within the bloc that top  50 million a year  It would affect revenue coming from specific digital services  such as digital advertising  paid subscriptions and the selling of personal data  The relatively high threshold is intended to ensure that the tax affects only large companies with a significant presence in the European Union The exact thresholds and rates have not yet been established  and the plan is not guaranteed to be put into effect  either  The proposals must still be approved by the parliament and the bloc s member states  and although countries such as France and Germany have raised concerns over companies they say have not paid their fair share of taxes  other member states like Ireland have opposed changes to a system in which they can use tax policy to attract businesses  The taxation will go to the biggest markets with the most sales  and that effectively means that activities which could be taxed in Estonia will be transferred to Germany   said Peter Chase  a senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund in Brussels who focuses on the trans Atlantic economy  trade and digital policy   Some member states may question whether that redistribution is a good thing  As the schism widens between the continents on how to ensure fairness on issues like market competition and data privacy rights in the digital era  it is not clear what steps Washington might take in response to a new European digital tax  but there could be calls for the Trump administration to retaliate In 2015  when the European Union tried to go after American technology companies for tax avoidance  some lawmakers urged the Treasury Department to use the president s authority to retaliate on the grounds that Europe was imposing discriminatory taxes on American businesses But European leaders are not just rankled by American tech companies  they are rankled by United States tax policy as well  They have criticized provisions of the new law that tax multinational corporations with operations in the United States  particularly a provision that taxes the American subsidiaries of foreign banks for loans they receive from their parent companies  saying that goes too far and violates World Trade Organization rules There is some concern among Republican lawmakers that Washington s push to impose tariffs could allow Europeans to argue to the trade body that the United States is engaged in a pattern of protectionist actions  not just on trade  but on taxes  The dispute could heat up on the sidelines of the G 20 conference in Argentina this week  where Mr  Mnuchin is meeting with other finance ministers 
NEW YORK    Published reports say Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is planning to testify before Congress about how his company collects and uses people s data Citing unnamed sources  CNN said in a report Tuesday that Zuckerberg has  come to terms  with the fact that he ll have to testify in a matter of weeks  A Facebook representative said the company has received invitations to appear before congress and is talking to legislators but would not confirm Zuckerberg s attendance Zuckerberg said last week in a CNN interview that he d be  happy to  testify if he is the right person to do it  The company is facing unprecedented scrutiny following reports that a data mining firm used ill gotten data from tens of millions of its users to try to influence elections A spokeswoman for the House Energy and Commerce Committee said Tuesday that reports of Zuckerberg s confirmed attendance are  incorrect   But she added that the committee is  continuing to work with Facebook to determine a day and time for Mr  Zuckerberg to testify

An advertising trade group that gave an award to Cambridge Analytica last year for its  big data  work during the 2016 presidential election is now urging marketers to reconsider the ethics of how consumer information is collected and used The trade group  the Advertising Research Foundation  said it was waiting for more information before formally rescinding the award given to Cambridge Analytica  the British political consulting firm that was recently reported to have improperly harvested the data of 50 million Facebook users  The revelations have brought intense criticism of Facebook  which is facing inquiries from lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic around how it handles user information  and have many people taking a closer look at the role of data in online advertising  We ve tended to assume that because you can do something  you should   Scott McDonald  chief executive of the ad group  said in an interview on Tuesday  He added that advertisers had been more concerned with the accuracy and validity of data they received from technology companies than with asking whether they should be collecting that data and using it to target consumers in the first place Mr  McDonald addressed the Cambridge Analytica situation and the need for new guidelines during a speech on Wednesday morning at the group s annual convention in New York Things were much different last year  when Cambridge Analytica won a gold prize at the foundation s David Ogilvy Awards  which have been given annually since 1994  The firm was honored for its work for the Trump campaign  in which it identified and advertised to undecided voters The selection  made by a jury of ad industry leaders  was  very controversial because of the nature of the campaign   Mr  McDonald said  But the ad group viewed itself as  Switzerland   he said  and was simply conducting  a scientific evaluation of the quality of work   Nobody had any idea the data might have been pilfered   he said  Mr  McDonald said he planned to potentially poll the jury again and  see if the accusations are sustained  before officially stripping Cambridge Analytica of the award The existence of the award highlights the enthusiasm with which marketers have approached the reams of consumer data generated by digital devices and their belief that people are happy to share whatever information technology may be collecting from them The Advertising Research Foundation  which acknowledged that the United States may adopt new regulations on how consumer data is collected  said it planned to work with other industry groups to form new guidelines for collecting and protecting that information  Mr  McDonald said advertising had gone too far in viewing consumers as prey  noting that even the industry s vocabulary had become militarylike  We talk about ad campaigns  consumers we target  We talk about subway takeovers  pop ups   he said   These are fairly aggressive  and I don t think we even think about it   they re just embedded in the metaphors of advertising

LONDON    A growing number of internet companies are banning cryptocurrency advertising  fearing reputational damage if their users are duped or left penniless  even as regulators struggle to get to grips with the fast emerging industry Twitter on Tuesday began blocking crypto ads  becoming the latest internet giant to crack down after moves by Alphabet s Google  and Facebook earlier this year Once restricted to small online chatrooms for early bitcoin backers  cryptocurrencies have since exploded in popularity and the industry has grown rapidly Huge billboards promoting the latest coin hang over Tokyo s streets  ads touting crypto trading dot the London underground network  and social media platforms are full of start ups looking to raise capital through  initial coin offerings   ICOs   as the selling of new virtual tokens is known While regulators have stepped up their warnings about the risks to consumers of investing in cryptocurrencies and the potential for scams  in most jurisdictions they are only beginning to discuss publicly how they might regulate the industry  let alone frame advertising rules Last week  the G20 group of nations failed to agree on specific regulatory action So companies are taking matters into their own hands  If internet companies were not already under pressure from regulators for their loose control of data privacy  they probably would not ban advertising from cryptos  which are still a gray area for many regulators   said Arnaud Masset  a crypto currency analyst at Swissquote Bank Snapchat in February started removing adverts for ICOs   which regulators say lack transparency and are susceptible to fraud   a spokesperson told Reuters The company declined to comment on whether it would widen the ban to include individual cryptocurrencies  crypto wallets and unregistered exchanges  as other technology giants have done LinkedIn is blocking crypto related ads  a spokesman said  although owner Microsoft does allow adverts on its other platforms AROUND THE WORLDAcross Asia  where the crypto frenzy is at its most feverish  firms are also restricting advertising China outlawed cryptocurrency exchanges and ICOs last year  Chinese internet titans Baidu  Tencent  and Weibo followed suit by curbing ads shortly after While Japan s government and regulators have embraced cryptocurrencies as a phenomenon that is here to stay  sentiment was hit by a  530 million cyber heist of an exchange in January Prime time TV advertising subsequently fell  billboards on Tokyo s transport network were cut back and online companies are responding with changes to their advertising policies Line  Japan s most popular social media site and messaging app  does not allow crypto related advertising  The policy is designed to protect customers and avoid legal risks  it says The country s financial watchdog  meanwhile  has asked the crypto industry s new self regulatory body to draw up advertising rules  It has not stipulated what it wants to see but it is likely that Japanese exchanges will not be allowed to mention specific currencies when advertising  while TV promotions for ICOs could be banned altogether  a source familiar with the matter told Reuters A spokesman for Yahoo Japan said the search engine was reviewing its policy in light of the changing environment Russian search site Yandex said it had not carried crypto ads for  a long time  While online companies are prohibiting ads  there is less evidence that traditional advertising routes are under threat London s metro system is plastered with advertising promoting crypto trading  Transport for London did not respond to requests for comment about its policy on advertising The slump in virtual currency prices this year has not rattled British punters lured in by adverts  however  A spokesman for Britain s Advertising Standards Authority said it had to date received fewer than 10 complaints about crypto ads LITTLE IMPACTCryptocurrencies  unlike most securities  do not confer ownership in the underlying business  which is partly why advertising is not currently governed in conjunction with financial authorities Also  regulators are reluctant to rush to impose rules on cryptocurrencies as they examine the possible benefits of the Blockchain technology underpinning them Many analysts expect the likes of Google and Facebook to loosen blanket bans once authorities provide guidance on how virtual currencies and the infrastructure around them will be treated Christie Dennehy Neil at the Internet Advertising Bureau  a British trade body  said large online platforms often introduce policies that take  a judgment more broadly than advertising  to protect their reputation She said that the ideal case  would be for a product to be regulated and for there to be sector specific rules for advertising   But without regulation in place  companies were sensible to act on their own accord  she added Crypto supporters argue the bans will have little impact In China  which tried to stamp out crypto trading through a crackdown last year  investing in the sector remains popular Also  while promotions on Twitter and Facebook may appeal to new would be buyers  investor conversations have shifted to other platforms and chatrooms where advertising is still permitted or where information on new coins is spread by word of mouth The price of bitcoin  BTC BTSP  fell heavily after the Facebook ads ban announcement  but the reaction to similar moves by Google and Twitter since then was muted  Interest in cryptocurrency and ICOs remains undiminished even in China   said Zennon Kapron at Shanghai based financial consultancy Kapronasia  The decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies and investors means that it remains relatively straightforward to access information about  and invest  In an indication of the strength of that interest  while Line may not allow any related advertising  it is currently applying for a license in Japan to operate its own cryptocurrency exchange  Additional reporting by Thomas Wilson in TOKYO  Maria Kiselyova and Polina Ivanova in MOSCOW and Dahee Kim in SEOUL  Editing by Sujata Rao and Hugh

 Good Tuesday  Here s what we re watching   Spotify s shares opened at  165 90   If the markets fall again  we have some possible explanations   Should Facebook offer  Why Me   buttons   Disney has offered to buy Sky News to help Fox s Sky bid Get this in your inbox each morning  Sign up here Spotify is a loss making company that might not report a profit until next decade  but that didn t stop investors from valuing the company at  30 billion when it debuted Tuesday on the United States stock market Spotify is an impressive company  Its loyal  paying customer base is enormous and is expected to keep growing  Also  Spotify has so far held its own in the face of competition from Apple  Amazon and Google  all of which want to win new subscribers to their music streaming services But there is an important reason that Wall Street is flocking to Spotify  It is doing a great job at getting record companies to roll over Spotify s main cost is what it pays record companies for the music it streams to its customers  As Spotify has grown  that expense has fallen as a share of its total revenue  which shows that Spotify is negotiating increasingly advantageous deals with record companies That has bolstered Spotify s gross profit margin  which measures how much money a company keeps after paying out the costs directly related to generating its revenue  Last year  that margin was 21 percent of revenue at Spotify  well up from 14 percent in 2016 Crucially  though  Spotify has said it expects its gross margin to expand to as much as 35 percent over the longer term  In other words  as Spotify s spending on music grows  so will its leverage over record companies  And it may well achieve its gross margin target  After all  Netflix  which occupies a similar position in the market for streaming video  has a gross margin of 35 percent But Spotify s main rivals could complicate things  What if Amazon offered record companies better terms than Spotify  That would reduce Spotify s bargaining power  making it harder to deliver wider gross margins investors are expecting  And Amazon  along with Apple and Google  has far deeper pockets to slog it out over the long term   Peter EavisSpotify s unusual path to the public markets was a success On its first day of trading on the New York Stock Exchange  the music streaming service finished with a valuation of  26 5 billion Spotify s shares opened at  165 90 before closing at  149 01 That s well above the high of  132 50 that its shares changed hands at in private transactions this year  It s also well above the  137 50 the WSJ reported its private shares were trading at during the past week Spotify had eschewed a typical initial public offering in favor of a direct listing  That meant there was no  deal price  for investors to reference on the first day of trading and no underwriters acting as stabilizing agents if the stock began to plunge Despite all that  Spotify s valuation at the close on Tuesday ranks among the highest for a tech company debuting on an American exchange Here s a look at the tech companies with the 10 biggest market capitalizations after their first day of trading  courtesy of

total  Tesla produced 35 000 cars in the first quarter   It has delivered 8 800 Model 3s during the first quarter  below the 8 800 analysts expected according to Bloomberg   In all  Tesla delivered a record 29 980 vehicles during the quarter   The company said it expects Model 3 weekly production to reach 5 000 by the end of the second quarter   The combined deliveries of the Model X and Model S came to 21 800 cars  the lowest total in several quarters ContextTesla s stock and bond prices have plunged amid concerns about how much cash the company is using as it struggles to speed up assembly

business to increase revenue The president reiterated his claim that Amazon is  costing the United States Postal Service massive amounts of money  in a post to Twitter on Tuesday morning Shares are

FAANG stocks are still weighing down the S  P  500 and the Nasdaq  as the likes of Facebook and Google face the prospect of greater regulation and President Trump repeats his attacks on Amazon   Tesla was down  too  but that s more understandable    Technical issues  Traders could be trimming bull market bets Peter Eavis s take  Before investors began fretting about tech and trade  the underpinnings of the stock market s ascent were perhaps not as robust as they looked  Analysts expect S  P  500 companies  earnings to grow 25 percent this year  But rising interest rates worldwide

Q  I live in a large Upper West Side co op with a BuildingLink online message board  Management approves all posts  without providing guidelines on what might be approved or rejected  This is a private bulletin board  and I don t expect complete freedom of speech  Still  it feels like anything more than an innocuous  for sale  announcement gets blocked  The moderators have rejected posts about an Upper West Side school rezoning debate  a post questioning what materials would be used for building improvements  and a post from a shareholder asking about a Paris apartment exchange  Should we have a stated policy  Is management being too controlling or is this normal oversight  Can shareholders request that questions not be subject to management approval A  Of the roughly 4 300 residential buildings that use BuildingLink message boards  about 85 percent moderate the posts that residents make  with 90 percent of those posts getting approved by management  according to data provided by BuildingLink Your board sounds more conservative than many others  however the problem may be about the content that shareholders try to post  People generally seem to use these message boards for pretty innocuous stuff  According to BuildingLink  half of all the posts that appeared on message boards were advertising items for sale  Other popular topics included requests for babysitters and housekeeping  The issues you mentioned are thornier  potentially making management nervous Mark A  Hakim  the director of the co op and condo department at the Manhattan law firm Chaves and Perlowitz  advises boards to restrict the use of online message boards to business uses  like posting the names of candidates for board elections  disseminating building notices  and letting residents make service requests  Turn the message board into an online water cooler and the board could open itself up to a possible defamation suit should conversations take a heated turn Your building should circulate a written policy explaining the permitted uses of the message board so residents understand the rules  Residents could also request a more open forum  However  the board would not be obligated to change its policy  To do that  you d need to elect board members sympathetic to your cause Consider a different forum for more impassioned debates  Set up a private Facebook  Yahoo or Google group for shareholders  moderated by residents  With such a group  the residents  not the management  would decide how to restrict the content and conversations  But brace yourself  Moderating social media groups can be a headache

TOKYO   Takako Suzuki is the youngest of the 707 lawmakers in Japan s Parliament and the latest of a handful of members to give birth while in office When Ms  Suzuki  a 32 year old member of the House of Representatives from the governing Liberal Democratic Party  announced last summer that she and her husband were expecting their first child  not everyone was supportive Critical comments were posted on various online platforms   Are you abandoning your job   or  You lack awareness as a person holding a public office   some of them said  according to Ms  Suzuki Her father  Muneo Suzuki  a former longtime member of Parliament  rushed to her defense   I understand that people have different ways of understanding things  But I cannot agree with the view that  she is  abandoning her duties   he wrote on his blog Ms  Suzuki said that she had never taken a day off while Parliament was in session and that she had never skipped any of her public duties In September  Ms  Suzuki gave birth to a healthy baby girl  Family members take turns looking after the child while Ms  Suzuki juggles frequent business trips between Tokyo and Hokkaido  the electoral district she represents These days  Ms  Suzuki is focused on policy measures such as allowing elected officials to take time off when they are injured or sick  She s also pushing to allow proxy voting for such lawmakers Ms  Suzuki said she was confronted almost daily with questions about her daughter   Why was she working when she had a baby to take care of   she recalled being asked   I get a lot of  I feel sorry for your baby   Or   Don t you need to be at home with your baby   Or   A mother not being with their child at this stage could negatively affect how the child grows up   It s discouraging  Ms  Suzuki has chosen not to breast feed and that  too  has drawn criticism   It s easiest to not say anything when I get these types of comments  and many people don t realize these are just their own beliefs   she said   I try very hard to let them know my child is fine and we re doing very well  Unless I reassure them  new mothers following my footsteps will also have to endure this criticism  Despite its status as the world s third largest economy  Japan lags far behind other countries when it comes to the participation of women in politics  According to data from the nonprofit Inter Parliamentary Union  China  the United States and South Korea are all ahead of Japan  It ranks 158 out of 193 countries  with women representing just 10 1 percent of its lower house  the House of Representatives   In the upper house  the House of Councillors  women make up 20 percent  It s no surprise  then  that the number of women who have become mothers while holding political office is minuscule  They are a novelty in Japan   said Hiroko Nagano  the founder of a Facebook group called Network for Politicians Giving Birth  While in Office   Ms  Nagano is an assemblywoman from Tokyo s City of Toshima district A survey conducted by Ms  Nagano and her team found that out of 874 city councils and other municipal level assemblies in Japan  just 140 female politicians have given birth while in office in the last 72 years  In 90 percent of these city councils and assemblies  no woman has ever given birth while in office Ms  Nagano formed her social media group in December  and she started a hotline in February to help widen her network s reach The aim of the Facebook group  which has 52 members so far  has been to make women who become pregnant while holding jobs more of the norm in Japan  The network  composed of mostly municipal level politicians  aims to share experiences  identify policy initiatives and advocate to carry out the policies in their communities  Although we are community leaders  we are always needing to apologize for our own actions as a result of being pregnant  delivering a baby or being a working mother   Ms  Nagano said   We felt it made sense to advocate for all the other mothers in the communities we serve so there is no apology needed  Hiromi Suzuki  34  an assemblywoman from Tokyo s City of Shinjuku district  is part of this Facebook group  Ms  Suzuki  who is not related to Takako Suzuki  has been advocating for maternity leave for all municipal level governments While many voters in Ms  Suzuki s community were supportive of her pregnancy  others expressed their disapproval After Hiromi Suzuki had her first baby four years ago  some of her campaign posters were defaced with vulgar and sexist remarks Councilwoman Yuuka Ogata  of Kumamoto City  has also been part of the Facebook network  Ms  Ogata  42  made headlines in November when she arrived at a council meeting with her 7 month old son  whom she was breast feeding Ms  Ogata said she received a thousand emails  letters  phone calls and social media posts after the November incident  about half of which were supportive Ms  Ogata said she felt most affected by negative feedback from other women  particularly the older generation of working mothers  One called Ms  Ogata  arrogant  and said that women needed to earn respect from men by  working harder than men  and not asking for more Motherhood has been blamed for some harsh consequences for female politicians During parliamentary elections last October  Megumi Kaneko  40  a two term Liberal Democratic Party lawmaker from Niigata  lost her seat in the lower house Ms  Kaneko had been criticized for using government vehicles occasionally to transport her toddler to and from the day care facility inside the government building where she worked Many Japanese voters said online that her actions were  not a problem  and having her child ride with her  made sense   However  many of Ms  Kaneko s voters in Niigata frowned on her use of government vehicles  calling her  privileged   Ms  Kaneko ultimately apologized Controversy caused by her husband  Kensuke Miyazaki  may have also tainted her image  In 2016  Mr  Miyazaki  then a lower house Liberal Democratic Party lawmaker  was praised for being the first lawmaker to ever take paternity leave  But he quickly lost support when news broke that he was having an extramarital affair while his wife was pregnant  Mr  Miyazaki resigned from his seat  Ms  Kaneko  in turn  was also criticized when it became clear she had decided not to divorce him Hiroko Miyashita  president of Yokohama based Maternity Harassment Prevention Network  said   If a woman in Japan becomes pregnant  they are almost seen as damaged goods in their workplaces  They are seen to no longer be as productive as those without children  
Dropbox  the file sharing company and Silicon Valley darling  had a strong market debut Friday  a reassuring sign for the technology industry and for the investors who have billions locked up in other highly valued but privately held start ups Shares of San Francisco based Dropbox  which had sold 36 million shares at  21 each on Thursday night  rose 36 percent in the first day of trading  That pushed Dropbox s market value to  11 2 billion  above where it had been valued in the private markets The initial public offering arrived at a dicey time  Stock markets have been on a roller coaster  with investors anxious about the threat of inflation  possible trade wars and geopolitical risks  The technology industry in particular has been buffeted by the prospect of tougher government regulation Giant tech companies helped drive another sharp sell off Friday  The Standard   Poor s 500 stock index tumbled 2 percent  with both Facebook and Amazon falling more than 3 percent  The S  P  is down more than 3 percent this year But the strong reception for Dropbox  which sells subscriptions to software that lets users collaborate and share files online  suggests that the public markets remain willing to offer a crucial exit point for early stage investors in the largest private Silicon Valley start ups  even amid broader concerns about large tech companies  I think the success of Dropbox s I P O  shows that great companies that are built to last can still access the I P O  window  despite a week of incredible volatility and distraction about global trade   said Bryan Schreier  a Dropbox board member and partner at Sequoia Capital  the large venture capital firm that was one of Dropbox s early investors Tapping the large amounts of capital in the public markets is becoming more important to such investors Over the last decade  hundreds of billions of dollars have poured into the venture capital industry  Those funds were then invested into a variety of young companies in the hope of finding the next Facebook or Google among a sea of flops The influx of cash fueled the tech economy  Between 2006 and 2016  the last year with available data  economic output in the metropolitan area that roughly corresponds to Silicon Valley rose  more than 5 percent a year  while the average growth rate in American metro areas was 1 2 percent And venture capital money meant that highly valued start ups    unicorns   in Silicon Valley parlance   were able to remain private for longer without turning to the public markets for fund raising  That posed a risk for venture capital firms and other investors  whose stakes had gained large amounts of value on paper but weren t easily liquidated There are 236 unicorns with a combined private market valuation in excess of  800 billion  according to CB Insights  a market research firm  They include some of the highest profile young companies in American business   names such as Uber  Airbnb and Elon Musk s SpaceX Given the huge values attached to those companies   Uber alone is valued at roughly  68 billion   access to the capital available in public markets has become all the more important  The public markets enable the companies to raise money to accelerate growth and  sometimes just as important  to provide a way for their early investors to cash out Since 2014  the  exits  by companies backed by venture capital  either through initial public stock offerings or acquisitions by other companies  have slowed As a result  the offering for Dropbox   along with the successful recent initial public offerings of other young companies   is good news for investors with large gains locked up in private companies Founded in 2007 by two Massachusetts Institute of Technology computer science students  Drew Houston and Arash Ferdowsi  Dropbox was backed by prominent venture investors in Silicon Valley  including Sequoia and Accel Partners  It has never turned an annual profit  but strong sales growth in recent years has pushed revenue above  1 billion annually  Today is the result of a lot of long term investments paying off   Mr  Houston said   We were able to get funding and achieve a lot of the goals where you formerly had to be a public company to do it  Dropbox s solid performance in its inaugural day of trading adds momentum to what has already been a strong start for the I P O  market this year  Roughly  12 9 billion had been raised in 43 offerings listed in the United States through Thursday  the strongest start since 2014  according to the market research firm Dealogic Another hotly awaited offering is the music streaming service Spotify  The company has filed to sell shares on the public markets on April 3  And last week  shares of an internet security company  Zscaler  another unicorn  soared more than 100 percent on their first day of trading Such first day pops aren t uncommon  The investment banks that lead I P O s often try to engineer those leaps in order to generate positive publicity about the company s prospects  The favorable reception on the first day doesn t guarantee a promising future for any company  even a highly valued Silicon Valley offering Last year  shares of Snap  the company behind the popular Snapchat app  surged 44 percent on the first day of trading  Since then  it has struggled to stay above its offering price of  17 a share  Another highly valued start up  the meal delivery company Blue Apron  went public at  10 a share in June and is now trading at roughly  2 
NAIROBI   A data analytics firm at the center of a controversy over its  acquisition and use of personal Facebook data in the 2016 United States presidential election is under new scrutiny for its role in Kenya s presidential election last year Senior officials of Cambridge Analytica  whose parent company is the SCL Group  said in an undercover video by Channel 4 News of Britain that the company played a critical role in President Uhuru Kenyatta s two campaigns  in 2013 and 2017 The revelations come only weeks after Mr  Kenyatta and his chief rival  Raila Odinga  reconciled after months of contention In the video  Mark Turnbull  a Cambridge Analytica executive  said the company twice rebranded Mr  Kenyatta s political party  wrote his campaign speeches and his political platform  and twice conducted surveys of 50 000 people to ascertain Kenyan voters  hope and fears A spokesman for Mr  Kenyatta referred inquiries to his party  the Jubilee Party  whose top official did not respond to messages seeking comment on Tuesday night Mr  Kenyatta won re election last October after two presidential votes  The first  in August  was nullified by the Supreme Court  which cited widespread irregularities and ordered a second election  Mr  Odinga pulled out of the second vote  which was held in October  saying the process was unfair The acrimonious political season included divisive speech by both parties  observers said  and continued well past Mr  Kenyatta s inauguration  The two archrivals shook hands and reconciled  this month Moses Karanja  a researcher on a project at Strathmore Law School in Nairobi about social media and misinformation during the presidential election  said the recent reports about Cambridge Analytica s role in Kenya  and its abuse of Facebook data globally  reinforced concerns raised in his own work about how Kenyans  personal data was accessed by political parties and even by government institutions  like the elections commission He said targeted text messages that he and others received during the campaign season suggested that individuals  voter registration information  social media data and telephone numbers were being independently linked   although it s still unclear how  We don t know how they accessed this data  or how it all ended up being linked to phone numbers and such   Mr  Karanja said   For me that s scary  Those are questions those platforms should answer  Gacheke Gachihi  who leads the Mathare Social Justice Center in Nairobi  said Cambridge Analytica s branding for Mr  Kenyatta was  divisive propaganda   raising ethnic enmity  The way you paint your opponent  you paint also his supporters   he said   and you and your ethnic base will feel like   This man is a devil   That undermines the work we are trying to do for social justice  Local news media had reported last spring that Mr  Kenyatta s party had retained Cambridge Analytica for his re election campaign  And David Murathe  the vice chairman of the Jubilee Party  told Reuters on Tuesday that SCL helped the campaign with branding last year Mr  Odinga s party also enlisted a data driven political consulting firm  but its on the ground team was deported from Kenya just a week before the election  according to The Los Angeles Times On its website  Cambridge Analytica names Kenya as one of its political case studies  describing a 47 000 person survey it conducted in 2013 to identify Kenyan voters  real needs  jobs   and  fears  tribal violence    as well as their  preferred information channels  The company also said it targeted youth voters with a social media campaign Cambridge Analytica s parent group  SCL  described similar activities on an archived page of its website  and said it also advised on communications  branding and strategy during the electoral period Cambridge said its survey was  the largest political research project ever conducted in East Africa   Mr  Turnbull told Channel 4 s undercover reporter that it repeated the survey in 2017 Those survey results  Mr  Karanja said  could reverberate beyond social media campaigns and  be translated into non Internet platforms like radio  television advertisements and billboards  He said his research team documented several examples of misinformation spreading on WhatsApp and other social media and filtering down to local talk radio shows or newspaper articles 
BRUSSELS   European authorities on Wednesday proposed revamping the way many technology companies in the region are taxed  outlining wide ranging changes that they hope will curb tax avoidance across the European Union The system would tax a company s revenues in the countries where they are generated  rather than its profits  Regulators say so called profit shifting allows some businesses to use regional offices in low tax countries to reduce payments The plan pits the European Union against the United States as both sides battle to retain corporate tax revenue  It is one of a number of issues on which Brussels and Washington have clashed  from the broader regulation of the technology industry to a dispute over American steel and aluminum tariffs The proposals unveiled on Wednesday also support the argument that Europe is the world s most prominent regulator of technology and digital services  The 28 nation European Union has outsize impact not just for its market of about 500 million customers  but because officials around the world increasingly take their cue from Brussels on how to regulate the tech industry  The digital revolution has turned our economies upside down   said Pierre Moscovici  the European Union s tax commissioner   When you  like  a picture  when you post a video on social media   he said   your click sets in motion a chain of business transactions and thus creates considerable profits   But under today s rules  those profits are not taxed   Mr  Moscovici said   The current legal vacuum is creating a substantial shortfall in the budgetary revenues of our member states   It also creates an uneven playing field between digital and traditional businesses  he argued The European Commission  the European Union s executive arm  says tech companies use the profit shifting method to reduce their tax burdens  In documents obtained by The New York Times before Wednesday s announcement  officials estimated that digital businesses in the bloc pay an average effective tax rate of just 9 5 percent  compared with 23 3 percent for traditional businesses Under the new proposals  a 3 percent tax would be levied on the sale of user data  targeted advertising and  interfaces that put together buyers and sellers   Officials estimate the tax would generate at least 5 billion euros  or  6 15 billion  annually for European Union member states Minimum thresholds  however  will mean that only large tech businesses will be subject to the tax  and companies will be able to deduct the payments from their corporate tax contributions to avoid double taxation The plans announced on Wednesday are not certain to be carried out  as they require the approval of the European Union s member states  and there is considerable disagreement over how much change is needed Notably  while big countries like France and Germany have pushed for changes  at least two smaller members have objected  saying the system allows them to attract employers by offering tax advantages Ireland   which is in a dispute with the European Commission over its tax treatment for Apple   quickly voiced opposition to the new plans on Wednesday  Leo Varadkar  the country s prime minister  said the measures were  ill judged  Still  policymakers both within and outside the European Union largely agree that changes are necessary to make global companies   whether digital or not   pay their fair share of tax The role that tech companies play in society has gotten particular attention in recent days  amid revelations that a political data firm with ties to President Trump s 2016 campaign gained access to private information on tens of millions of Facebook users  Facebook is one of several companies that have been in the cross hairs of regulators in Europe over the mishandling of personal data  tax avoidance and antitrust violations Last year  the European Commission fined Google  2 4 billion for abusing its dominant market position  while companies like Apple  Amazon and Qualcomm have also been investigated or penalized  The dominance of Silicon Valley in the industry has  however  spurred criticism that European regulators are too harsh on American businesses  an allegation officials in Brussels strongly reject 
WASHINGTON   The Senate gave final approval on Wednesday to legislation that strengthens the policing of sex trafficking  over the opposition of many internet companies  Lawmakers are trying to catch up to the reality of prostitution long after the bartering of children and adults moved from the streets to the web The 97 to 2 vote was the culmination of a multiyear effort by Republicans and Democrats to allow state law enforcement officials to go after websites like Backpage com that facilitate sex trafficking  The bill would also suspend protections that shielded internet companies from legal liability for the content on their sites The legislation has pitted lawmakers against Silicon Valley companies and civil liberties groups  which hold starkly differing views on the government s oversight of the internet  Big tech companies like Facebook and Google have flourished with little regulation for years  but they have come under intense scrutiny after their platforms were manipulated by foreign agents during the 2016 presidential election With passage of the  Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act  Silicon Valley s ability to stay out of the government s reach suffered a rare setback  The bill passed the House overwhelmingly last month  and President Trump is expected to sign it into law  The president and his entire administration are firmly committed to holding those who participate in these horrific crimes accountable  and look forward to continued work with these stakeholders in order to put an end to this scourge   the White House press secretary  Sarah Huckabee Sanders  said in a statement after the vote  It s a wake up call   said Senator John Thune of South Dakota  chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee  which convened hearings on sex trafficking   This is clearly illegal activity  It was happening online  But I think in the future  tech companies have to understand that it s not the wild West  and they have to exercise responsibility  Paul Gallant  an analyst at Cowen  said the sex trafficking bill would not directly hurt big internet companies  But he said it was  cracking the door open to broader platform liability for other types of content   Today  it s sex trafficking   he added   And down the road  it s content from foreign governments  Internet companies have feared the bill would weaken a crucial legal shield that since 1996 has guarded them from liability for illegal content on their sites  They point to the safe harbor provision as the foundation for the growth of internet commerce  Civil liberties groups have decried the bill as a threat to free speech and a limit to the free flow of content on the web But that protection for websites  lawmakers argued  has been abused and needed revision so law enforcement could pursue the worst perpetrators  such as Backpage com  a popular classified advertising site that freely advertises sex for sale  while hiding behind the safe harbor clause The new bill will allow state police and attorneys general to go after sites that knowingly host sex trafficking content  It will also allow victims of sex trafficking to sue such sites for damages  This is legislation that is overdue in my view  and it s required   said Senator Rob Portman  Republican of Ohio  who was a co author of the bill with Senator Richard Blumenthal  Democrat of Connecticut   The courts have told us that  The district attorneys have told us that  The attorneys general told us that  When it was introduced in August 2017  the bill attracted immediate support from law enforcement and advocates for victims of sex trafficking  It also drew intense opposition from tech companies and free speech advocates  who say any weakening of liability protections would lead to abuse by law enforcement  hurt start ups that cannot afford to fight lawsuits and stifle free speech The law  would almost certainly cause irreparable harm to free speech and the internet economy   said Robyn Greene  policy counsel and government affairs chief for Open Technology Institute at New America  a research and advocacy group But with prominent fights flaring over Russian election interference  data breaches and other scandals  the biggest tech companies   no longer wishing to publicly oppose a bill fighting sex trafficking   retreated from their lobbying effort in recent weeks The Internet Association  a trade group whose members include Facebook  Google  Netflix and Apple  has backed off from the strong stance they had against the bill when it was introduced  The internet industry shares the goals of lawmakers who want to put an end to trafficking online  and Internet Association will continue to be a key partner with policymakers on this important issue   said Michael Beckerman  president of the group  who added that it would work to preserve other aspects of the liability shield The legislation stemmed from a two year Senate investigation led by Mr  Portman into Backpage com  the classifieds page rampant with ads for prostitution and sex trafficking  During the investigation  Mr  Portman and Mr  Blumenthal heard from state law enforcement officials who said that they were not able to press charges against websites like Backpage com  which evoked safe harbor under the liability portion of the 1996 Communications Decency Act  We re opening the courthouse doors   Mr  Blumenthal said after Wednesday s vote According to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children  nearly 90 percent of the trafficking of children occurs online  Seven out of 10 child trafficking reports involve Backpage com  the group said But over the past seven years  20 cases involving the website were rejected by courts that  acknowledged the horror of the allegations made regarding the child victims  trafficking  but were  powerless to act   Yiota G  Souras  general counsel for the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children  told Congress last November The liability provision  created by Senator Ron Wyden  Democrat of Oregon  was intended to help foster the growth of the nascent internet  It was adopted before smartphones and companies like Google and Facebook existed On Wednesday  Mr  Wyden argued on the Senate floor that the bill as written would harm the internet economy  It ll pull up the ladder  leaving the

Corporate philanthropy  business leaders would have us believe  is the ringing voice of a company s social conscience  Exxon Mobil may stand accused of misleading investors and shareholders about what it knew about climate change  but the ExxonMobil Foundation s multimillion dollar contributions to end deaths from malaria and to train women in developing countries should  executives hope  balance the ethical ledger The same goes for the Walmart Foundation s contributions to reduce carbon emissions in China and to protect wilderness areas in the United States  or the Dow Chemical Foundation s contribution to Habitat for Humanity  These companies might be ruthless in their lines of work   fighting against environmental regulations or more stringent labor standards   but their foundations are in it to do good to the world Not entirely  it appears  Just months before the midterm congressional elections  a group of economists have published an analysis of how corporate America is spreading its philanthropic wealth Sifting through the donations to charity from 1998 to 2015 by foundations set up by the largest companies in the United States   those in the Fortune 500 or the Standard   Poor s 500 stock index   Marianne Bertrand of the University of Chicago s Booth School of Business  Matilde Bombardini and Francesco Trebbi of the University of British Columbia  and Raymond Fisman of Boston University detected a pattern of contributions to 1 087 charities linked to 451 members of Congress Turns out that the spending is a little more self serving than companies would have us believe  Some of the charitable giving looks a lot like corporate lobbying  Because companies get a break for such giving  it amounts to political spending at taxpayers  expense   Firms deploy their charitable foundations as a form of tax exempt influence seeking   the researchers write Think of it like this  One way a company could please Senator Chuck Grassley  the Iowa Republican who leads the Judiciary Committee and is a member of the committees on finance  agriculture  the budget and taxation  would be to have a corporate political action committee donate directly to his campaign But there is another way  one that often slips below the radar of campaign finance watchdogs  Why not donate to the Partnership for a Drug Free Iowa  where the senator has been an honorary advisory board member A corporation could also give to the University of Northern Iowa Foundation  on whose board Mr  Grassley sat as a trustee  Over the period covered by the study  the foundations of AT T  ConAgra Foods  General Electric  Goldman Sachs  Medtronic  Merck  Monsanto  Nationwide Insurance  Principal Financial Group and Rockwell Collins all contributed to one or the other Mr  Grassley s office  when asked about the corporate contributions to causes linked to the senator  said   Senator Grassley receives many requests to support various nonprofit organizations  He lends his name to some  but declines most  That companies might butter up legislators by donating to their pet charities is not new  In 2010  my colleague Eric Lipton documented the contributions to the Joe Baca Foundation and the James E  Clyburn Research and Scholarship Foundation  each affiliated with a Democratic member of Congress The researchers who conducted the new study don t claim that any specific charitable contribution was meant to manipulate the political process  But their work lays bare the extent to which corporate donations may respond to political  rather than charitable  motivations It is possible that when the Exelon Corporation donated  25 000 to Representative Joe Barton s effort to build a Boys and Girls Club in Texas in 2008  it did so because it believed in boys and girls  not because Mr  Barton was the top Republican member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee  Microsoft s donation to the Seattle Art Museum may have reflected the company s support for the arts  not its desire to please Representative Jim McDermott  who was on the museum s honorary committee   Mr  McDermott  a Democrat  has since retired  The new research uncovers patterns in the aggregate data that suggest corporate donations are often dictated by recipients  political clout  For instance  a company foundation will donate more to charities in districts where the representatives have gained seats on a committee that is important to the company  And when the member of Congress leaves office  corporate donations to charities in his or her district will dip Corporations  philanthropy often flows to the same areas as their political action committee contributions  Charities in districts where companies favor a particular candidate tend to get more corporate donations A charity need not have been founded by a member of Congress to get corporate money  But it helps  A nonprofit is more than four times more likely to receive grants from a corporate foundation if a politician sits on its board  And corporate foundation grants are even more likely if the politician happens to sit on a committee being lobbied by the firm The authors of the study examined only a subset of corporate philanthropy  money flowing through corporate foundations that must disclose the recipients of their largess  But the research suggests that the impact of corporate contributions could be much bigger than even critics of campaign finance practices realize The researchers estimate that over 7 percent of charitable donations by corporate foundations are intended to buy political leverage  Applied to  18 billion worth of corporate philanthropy in 2014  that would amount to  1 3 billion  almost four times as much as total political action committee contributions that year and 40 percent more than the corporations  lobbying expenditures There are a couple of lessons here  For those who favor campaign finance reform  perhaps the most urgent message is that there are many doors that corporate America can use to buy influence  But the research also highlights the way that companies interact with society Corporations are likely to tally their foundations  charity as a decided plus on the dashboard of corporate social responsibility  But politically motivated charitable giving meant to undercut regulations  promote a tax cut or otherwise gain a break could actually reduce total welfare As the researchers write   If corporations  good deeds  in the form of charitable contributions  cater to politicians  interests  who as a result put the interests of business ahead of those of voters  the overall welfare effects are ambiguous   society benefits via increased charity  at the potentially high cost of distorting laws and regulation  None of this would happen  of course  if politicians weren t so hungry for corporate money   Companies wouldn t do this if it didn t pay off   Professor Bombardini told me   Politicians get good publicity by channeling funds that are valuable to the community  Whatever makes you look good  you want to take credit for it  But with a new wave of scandals engulfing some of the nation s corporate titans  it would behoove them to honestly assess the ultimate purpose of their charity Facebook doesn t have a corporate foundation  But its chief executive  Mark Zuckerberg  has pledged 99 percent of his Facebook shares to advance human potential and promote equality  Perhaps the pledge could include never deploying his company s financial might to steer the nation s political process for corporate gain 
The Trump Bump is becoming the Trump Slump In the first year of Donald J  Trump s presidency  ebullient investors propelled stock markets to one record high after another  And Mr  Trump was the bull in chief  celebrating the record breaking march as validation of his economic policies Those days are done Even after a fast start to 2018  stock markets finished the first quarter down for the year   the first quarterly decline since 2015  It suggested that a period of calm and steadily rising markets had given way to a turbulent new era with a bearish bent The plunge continued Monday  with the Standard   Poor s 500 stock index sinking 2 2 percent  Investors jettisoned shares of financial  technology and many other businesses  spooked at least in part by a tweet from Mr  Trump aimed at one of the country s biggest companies  Amazon Asian and European markets were down more modestly in midday Tuesday trading Monday s decline left stocks down more than 4 percent so far in 2018  They are now down more than 10 percent from their peak in late January  That means the market has entered a so called correction   a term used to indicate that the downward trend is more severe and lasting than simply a few days of bearish trading The stock market is still up more than 20 percent since Nov  8  2016  the day Mr  Trump won the White House   a roller coaster ride driven in part by expectations about what a Trump presidency could bring to Washington At first  the prospect of Republicans controlling the White House and both houses of Congress thrilled investors  They anticipated a wave of regulatory rollbacks and the slashing of corporate and personal tax rates  Many of those dreams have been realized  culminating in Mr  Trump signing a huge tax cut into law in December  When the S  P  500 notched its high water mark of 2872 87 on Jan  26  it represented a roughly 325 percent increase since the bull market began in March 2009 But since February  a toxic stew of factors   many but certainly not all of them emanating from Washington   has polluted what had been the market s placidly rising waters  And there s little prospect of the messes dissipating anytime soon First there was the risk that the economy might be growing too fast  which could prompt central banks to hike interest rates sooner than expected  Then there was the risk of a trade war ignited by the White House imposing tariffs on certain products  an action that quickly prompted countries like China to erect trade barriers of their own  Next came the threat of a government crackdown on technology companies  after revelations of their misuse of customer data Monday s dose of unnerving news was a presidential tweet aimed at Amazon  which Mr  Trump accused of hurting the United States Postal Service  Mr  Trump s feud with the company has been going on sporadically since before he became president  but the onslaught has accelerated lately  On Monday  Mr  Trump tweeted that the Post Office loses money by working with Amazon  and this will be changed  In the face of these factors  the optimism of just two months ago has all but evaporated  It certainly adds to uncertainty  and the market doesn t like uncertainty   said Ed Clissold  chief United States strategist at Ned Davis Research  a stock market research firm One thing is clear  The days of calm markets marching steadily higher  shattering one record after another  are gone for now  That carries risks for Mr  Trump  who spent the first year of his presidency as a stock market cheerleader but in recent months has been mostly silent about the market s gyrations It also could be a danger for the United States economy  Academic research suggests that long term market declines can rub off on consumers  leading them to feel less affluent and therefore spend less money  That is bad news for an economy that hinges largely on zesty consumer spending The market s decline over the past two months has been broad based  Six of the 11 sectors included in the S  P  500 index are down more than 10 percent from the market high in late January On any given day  a particular sector might be clobbered  One day it could be industrial companies such as Boeing or Caterpillar  which export lots of products and therefore could be harmed in a trade war  Another day could bring declines to technology companies like Facebook and Twitter  whose profits are vulnerable to tougher government regulation of social media networks  The next day it could be energy and financial companies  whose fortunes would be diminished if the economy slows On Monday  just 13 stocks in the S  P  500 rose The meat producer Tyson dropped more than 6 percent  after China imposed duties on pork and fruit from the United States in response to the tariffs that the Trump administration has imposed on products imported from China  China is one of Tyson s most important export markets  Lean hog futures   which reflect the anticipated prices of pig carcasses   were down 3 9 percent After Mr  Trump s complaint about Amazon  it too  was a big loser  falling 5 2 percent  Other giant tech firms were sucked into the downdraft  Microsoft dropped 3 percent  Facebook tumbled 2 8 percent  bringing its year to date decline to 14 4 percent  And Intel dove 6 percent after a Bloomberg News report that Apple was planning to use its own chips in its computers instead of Intel processors And Tesla  reeling amid doubts about its ability to churn out electric vehicles  tumbled more than 5 percent The tech sector has been the epicenter of stock market pain in recent weeks  hurt by concerns about trade friction with China   a key market and supplier for tech firms   and fears of tighter government regulation  Even before Monday s fall  some  457 billion had been wiped off the sector s total market value  People think that tech is going to go from the Wild West to a much more regulated  scrutinized environment   said Dan Suzuki  an equity strategist with Bank of America Merrill Lynch Even the shares of financial institutions   the companies that would most likely benefit from a looser regulatory environment favored by Republicans   have been battered  The sector dropped 2 1 percent Monday  with investors worried about an unfavorable lending environment For markets  nothing is for sure  They could rebound mightily later this week and shake off jitters about a trade war  But some observers believe conditions may have to get worse before they can get better   and there could be more declines before that happens  In order for the market to bottom  there probably has to be more consternation and more pessimism about the current environment   said Mr  Clissold  of Ned Davis Research 
WASHINGTON   President Trump escalated his attack on Amazon on Thursday  saying in an early morning tweet that the online retail behemoth does not pay enough taxes   and strongly suggesting that he may use the power of his office to rein in the nation s largest e commerce business Mr  Trump accused Amazon  one of the country s most recognizable and successful brands  of putting thousands of local retailers out of business and said the company was using the United States Postal Service as its  Delivery Boy  The president has lashed out publicly against the giant company and its chief executive  Jeff Bezos  on Twitter more than a dozen times since 2015  And privately  people close to him said  Mr  Trump repeatedly brings up his disdain for the company  often set off by his anger at negative stories in The Washington Post  which is owned by Mr  Bezos By focusing on the threat to small businesses  Mr  Trump has touched on the unease of Amazon s disruptive force  The company has changed industries as varied as publishing  groceries and health care  That has helped the company grow to be worth more than  700 billion  but it has also made it a convenient target The president has little clear authority to take action against the company  Some Amazon critics have suggested antitrust actions against the company  but the moves would need to come from the independent Federal Trade Commission or the Justice Department  where officials have promised to keep politics out of its corporate competition cases Lindsay Walters  a White House spokeswoman  told reporters on Thursday that  the president has expressed his concerns with Amazon  We have no actions at this time  Still  Mr  Trump s willingness to again single out Amazon and characterize it as a tax cheat and a job killer is a remarkable use of the presidential bully pulpit that could have serious implications for the company even without any formal moves by the federal government His comments have already spooked investors  sending Amazon stocks tumbling Wednesday after an article on the website Axios about his anger toward the company  The stock fell further after his tweet on Thursday  though prices rebounded later The tech industry is increasingly on the defensive  Facebook is under attack in Washington for its handling of personal data and the social network s role in the 2016 election  And the recent death of a pedestrian by a self driving car has renewed criticism of Uber  The general principle that I know deeply concerns the president is that we need to live in a world where the government sets a level playing field between internet vendors and mom and pop stores   Kevin Hassett  the chair of the president s council on economic advisers  said Thursday on Fox Business Drew Herdener  an Amazon spokesman  declined to comment Several current and former officials said that Mr  Trump regularly conflates Amazon with The Post  Mr  Bezos owns the paper privately  separate from his role at Amazon Brad Parscale  the president s 2020 campaign manager  on Thursday channeled Mr  Trump s anger about The Post in a tweet of his own  saying   Do not forget to mention that  amazon has probably 10x the data on every American that  facebook does  All that data and own a political newspaper  The  washingtonpost  Hmm  And far right  conspiracy fanning websites   some of which Mr  Trump is known to read   have for months stoked the idea that The Post is in cahoots with the C I A  because the agency contracts with Amazon to provide cloud based data storage  Last November  a headline at one of those sites  Infowars  said   BEZOS   DEEP STATE UNITE  AMAZON LAUNCHES CLOUD SERVICE FOR CIA  The Post declined to comment One person close to Mr  Trump  who asked for anonymity to discuss private discussions in the Oval Office  said that the president mused about the issue of Amazon and taxes at least a half dozen times in the last six months  The president has repeatedly claimed that Amazon costs the Postal Service money even though officials have explained to him that is not the case  Amazon has said that the Postal Regulatory Commission  which oversees the service  has consistently found that its contracts with Amazon are profitable People close to Mr  Trump say the president is convinced that Amazon unfairly benefits from tax laws  The internet giant collects sales taxes on its own products in all 45 states that have one  but third party vendors who sell products on the site often do not collect sales tax  a fact that rivals say is unfair  In addition  some municipalities complain that the company does not collect local taxes In April  the Supreme Court will hear arguments in an case on whether to allow states to impose sales taxes on all internet sales  Many observers believe the justices are poised to reverse its 1992 ruling that exempted online retailers with no physical presence in a state Mr  Trump hears the sales tax complaints frequently during visits with his wealthy friends at his Mar a Lago estate in Florida  and in meetings at the White House  several aides and associates said  One person familiar with his thinking said that the president believes many of his core supporters are hurt when Amazon disrupts the local businesses where they live The president s critique is shared by some of his usual adversaries in the Democratic Party  Like many of Mr  Trump s wealthy Republican friends  Representative Keith Ellison  Democrat of Minnesota  has been critical of Amazon s growing power in the marketplace  The Trump administration should rein in giants like Amazon because they have an unfair stranglehold on the competition  not because the president has a personal feud with a company s C E O    Mr  Ellison said in a statement on Thursday There was also some irony in the criticism coming from Mr  Trump  who has boasted about his dexterity in avoiding paying taxes   This is the guy who said that not paying taxes  makes me smart    said Matt Gardner  senior fellow at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy  a nonpartisan research organization How the president could slow Amazon  beyond take to Twitter or complain about the company in speeches  is unclear If Mr  Trump were to pressure the Justice Department to pursue antitrust enforcement action against Amazon  it would be a sharp break from tradition  experts say  because the White House has kept a far distance from those cases for decades  It would be a gross violation and abuse of our due process   said Diana Moss  president of the American Antitrust Institute But the president has repeatedly crossed lines that his predecessors have observed  In the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election  he has pressured Justice Department officials to investigate his Democratic rivals and to abandon the investigation of himself and his associates AT T and Time Warner have suggested Mr  Trump played a role in the Justice Department s decision to block the companies   85 4 billion media merger  Makan Delrahim  the head of antitrust at the Justice Department  has said under oath in Congress that he would not allow the White House to impact his decisions over that merger or any other cases Mr  Trump also surprised antitrust experts with his swift decision to block Broadcom s merger with Qualcomm earlier this month  after a review by a government panel on foreign investments  The president has direct authority to block a merger with foreign companies that pose national security concerns Amazon has tried  through lobbyists and outside consultants  to meet with administration officials and members of Congress to counter arguments about the company s tax collection and its relationship with the Postal Service The size of company s lobbying staff has ballooned in recent years  according to public filings  focusing largely on drones  transportation  taxes and cybersecurity  It has hired antitrust consultants over the past year In 2015  shortly after Mr  Trump started his attacks against the company  Mr  Bezos joked on Twitter about sending the candidate into space on a rocket made by Blue Origin  a space exploration start up Mr  Bezos owns But when Mr  Trump became the Republican nominee and then president  Mr  Bezos and Amazon stopped responding to his attacks  seeing little upside in a public quarrel with him  according to two people briefed on the decision  The people  who spoke on condition of anonymity because the conversations were private  said that these days  Mr  Trump s tweets were more likely to prompt eye rolling inside the company than any serious effort at crisis control 
SAN FRANCISCO   In 1980  Dave Patterson  a computer science professor  looked at the future of the world s digital machines and saw their limits With an academic paper published that October  he argued that the silicon chips at the heart of these machines were growing more complex with each passing year  But the machines  he argued  could become more powerful if they used a simpler type of computer chip This counterintuitive idea spread across Silicon Valley  driven by the work of Mr  Patterson at the University of California in Berkeley and a second academic  John Hennessy  about 40 miles away at Stanford University  They called it RISC  short for  reduced instruction set computer  On Wednesday  the Association for Computing Machinery  the venerable computing society that represents industry professionals across the world  announced that Mr  Patterson and Mr  Hennessy had won this year s Turing Award  often called the Nobel Prize of computing  They will share a  1 million cash prize Named for the British mathematician and pioneering computer scientist Alan Turing  the award carries an added resonance this year  as the chip industry takes another step toward the kind of future envisioned by Mr  Patterson and Mr  Hennessy Today  more than 99 percent of all new chips use the RISC architecture  according to the association  This is the one fundamental idea that has been sustained over the last several decades of chip design   said Dave Ditzel  a chip industry veteran who studied with Mr  Patterson at Berkeley  Mr  Ditzel helped popularize many of the same ideas and is now building a new RISC chip at a start up called Esperanto Mr  Patterson and Mr  Hennessy were interested in simpler chips because they ran faster  consumed less power  made life easier for chip designers and allowed machines to evolve at a faster rate  In the mid 1980s  new RISC chips emerged from two Silicon Valley start ups  Sun Microsystems and MIPS Technologies  becoming the standard for the computer workstations and servers that underpinned big corporate operations Those processors were eventually eclipsed by chips from Intel  which put its considerable muscle behind a competing design  But as computing expanded into smartphones  tablets  and other small devices   where power and space are at a premium   more and more chips used designs from a British company called ARM  short for Advanced RISC Machine As a book written by the two researchers in 1989  Computer Architecture  A Quantitative Approach  became the standard text for chip design  even Intel took a partial step toward the RISC idea  Its chips continued to use their own complex way of talking to a computer s software  but started to use some aspects of RISC Intel chips still drive the data centers that power the internet  But as these chips approach their physical limits  internet giants like Google  Facebook  and Amazon are pushing tasks onto a wide range of simpler processors that consume much less power  sparking a renaissance in chip design  Complexity is even more of an enemy than it was before   Mr  Ditzel said   We have to design differently  Mr  Patterson and Mr  Hennessy are at the heart of this change  Their book is now in its sixth edition  Mr  Hennessy is on the board of directors of Google s parent company  Alphabet  after serving as the president of Stanford for 16 years  And Mr  Patterson works in the Google research lab that is designing low powered chips specifically for artificial intelligence As time goes on  the world could move even more toward the RISC way of doing things  thanks to an organization called the RISC V Foundation  which has published a chip architecture that anyone can use for free  said industry veteran Dennis Allison  The organization was founded by Dave Patterson and others from Berkeley  I expect this to play a vital role in the future   Mr  Patterson said   And the architecture is not that different from what John and I described back in 1980  
TOMORROW WILL BE DIFFERENT Love  Loss  and the Fight for Trans Equality By Sarah McBride 273 pp  Crown Archetype   26The most stirring moments in the memoir  Tomorrow Will Be Different  are not those in which Sarah McBride is making public history  whether as American University s first transgender student body president or the first openly trans person to speak before a major party convention  They are the private moments  when her mother tells her that she feels as if her son is dying  when she unexpectedly falls in love  when she realizes that this transgender man she plans to spend the rest of her life with will die  It is when McBride   having lived her entire adult life in public as a trans advocate and budding political figure   is finally able to shed her public persona that her narrative is most resonant  By becoming a nuanced character in her own book  she humanizes the impossibly competent  morally unsullied ideal she seems on the surface McBride acknowledges the difficulty of letting her guard down when she describes her advocacy of a Delaware trans rights bill before the State Senate in 2013   A few months before  displaying such vulnerability before that body seemed impossible  but through the last several months I had found my voice   There is a constant tension in the book between McBride s ingrained reliance on logic over emotions  and her efforts to break through these intellectual barriers to fully reveal herself  in her book and in the outside world The memoir starts off with a moving history of McBride s profound inner conflict as a child   When the boys and girls would line up separately in kindergarten  I d find myself longing to be in the other line    as I d play in the Cinderella dress  the proverbial stroke of midnight would arrive  I d have to take it off and return to playing the part that I d already learned was more than just expected of me   it was  me  to everyone else in my life   Her account of the day she comes out to her college community  in contrast  is more tentative  If the language feels timeworn   I couldn t hide anymore   and  once she posts her letter on Facebook   it didn t take long for the news to spread like wildfire    it evokes a narrative insecurity that mirrors the nervous self doubt she experiences while actually living through her gender transition By the time she finds herself arguing before the Delaware legislature  though  both McBride the character and the book s narrative voice have gained enough confidence to passionately convince their audiences of her lifelong cause  The debate scene comes alive through the specificity of McBride s prose  She recalls how some Republican lawmakers at first cast trans people as restroom predators  before becoming  more muted  and  almost sheepish  in their opposition after her testimony  unable to fully vilify trans people after interacting with one  As McBride sits in tears on the Senate floor  State Senator Karen Peterson is the only one to comfort her   for Peterson  who is lesbian  recognizes  the indignity of having to plead for your most basic rights   McBride writes  The scene s pathos underlines the absurdity of having to debate anyone s right to a life free from discrimination At the same time  these extended chapters on trans advocacy  teeming with data and policy details  feel shallower than those that develop the star crossed romance between McBride and the young transgender rights advocate Andrew Cray  From his first appearance in the book  at President Obama s White House L G B T  reception in 2012  the narrative intermingles the excitement of new love with the anticipation of its loss   I think we d get along pretty swimmingly   Cray messages McBride on Facebook two months after that encounter  his significance in her life already promising to be as noteworthy as his charming use of an adverb Cray takes a central role in  Tomorrow Will Be Different  only when a sore on his tongue turns out to be cancer  which later progresses to his lungs  As McBride cares for Cray  his illness seems to dismantle her walls of pragmatism and perfectionism  At one point she breaks down over a malfunctioning suction machine  falling to the floor in tears and shouting   I can t do this   At another  she decides to spend Christmas with her parents instead of Cray  as much as she knows it will hurt him  These flaws   these moments where she appears least noble   are evidence of this exemplary woman s humanity Cray himself also buoys these scenes with his particular blend of stubbornness and charm  He insists on remaining independent from his family through his illness  only to rely on McBride as his caregiver instead  And yet  as the 27 year old man sits in the tub and asks   Can you wash my tush   in a playful acknowledgment of the infantilizing force of his disease  we understand his irreverence  and how McBride fell so deeply in love  This anxiety over death s cruel interruption of true love permeates her narrative of Cray s cancer  their wedding and his passing  which McBride narrates vividly and without the self consciousness that is at times distancing elsewhere in the book Meanwhile  trans identity in McBride and Cray s love story never becomes abstracted from experience  McBride s identity enables her specific life circumstances  but it cannot be reduced  codified or turned into a statistic like the one that says 41 percent of trans men and women have attempted suicide  a number the book cites more than once   Even if McBride and Cray s were the only trans relationship ever in which one person ended up a widow because of the other s cancer  their immediate connection   the authenticity and specificity of their love   is what inspires the greatest compassion for the universal trans experience  in all its nuance and diversity  The book s strength lies in its portrayal of McBride and Cray as fully realized individuals beyond their transgender identities After Cray s death  however  McBride s narrative pivots swiftly back to politics without leaving either her or her readers sufficient space to grieve  This is a young woman who has just lost the love of her life at 24  It doesn t seem quite enough for her to merely add his name  as tribute  to the list of her accomplishments to date  or to merely participate in policies that Cray helped develop  It feels as though the compromises that become routine in McBride s advocacy   from her willingness to plead with outright bigots for her basic dignity  to her position at the Human Rights Campaign  a mainstream L G B T  organization that has been criticized by the trans community for prioritizing gay marriage over trans rights   equally compromise her ability to give the reader an accurate picture of her own grief  which could have imbued  Tomorrow Will Be Different  with the enduring quality of other memoirs of loss  With a foreword by former Vice President Joe Biden that frames the book as an instructive tome for trans people  parents and the general public  the book is perhaps positioned less as a lasting literary contribution and more as a manual for tolerance that puts its writer in a good position to run for office The inconsistencies and contradictions in McBride s book reflect the difficulty of trying to explain the transgender experience to a predominantly cisgender public  Some trans readers  myself included  may find themselves growing impatient with the author s frequent quoting of dire statistics  or her Trans 101 style arguments for bathroom equality  Her case is too often predicated on the idea that the value of trans lives is even up for debate I gravitate to the parts of McBride s memoir in which she relies instead on her sincere and singular identity   as a young widow who was raised as a boy surrounded by an environment of relative privilege despite inner turmoil   to continue her fight for justice  I want to believe that readers across the gender spectrum will be moved by the improbable commingling of two trans lives  and for the cruelty of having one of these lives taken away And yet  I confess  I m not so sure  Perhaps a non trans reader would appreciate McBride s appeals to sympathy  like her concluding anecdotes about trans kids she s encountered  when asked what she wants to be when she grows up  12 year old Stella declares   The first trans president     But these episodes feel reminiscent of the politician s well worn strategy of using other people s   especially children s   stories to humanize contentious political and social issues  when McBride s own life is testament enough to the validity and intensity of these obstacles If  Tomorrow Will Be Different  provides a vision for a future of trans equality  I hope it will be one in which the dignity of transgender individuals is not up to cisgender arbiters for approval  Such a future of true equality would breed not only full respect for

JUST THE FUNNY PARTS       And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys  Club By Nell Scovell Illustrated  311 pp  Dey St  Morrow   27 99 On the first day that Nell Scovell arrived at her office as a writer on  Late Night With David Letterman   a new colleague stopped to greet her  They chatted amiably about mutual friends  And then he laid it out   Before this is over   he told her   I will see a tampon fall out of your purse   I felt strangely shaken as he walked away   Scovell writes in  Just the Funny Parts    And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys  Club   The remark puzzled her for decades  Then  doing research for another book  she learned to identify it not merely as adolescent posturing from a man child but as what she terms  stereotype threat   When members of a group are made aware of a negative stereotype  they are more likely to conform to that stereotype   she writes   meaning that  if she believed the bunk that women aren t funny  the co worker singling out her gender might have killed her confidence and torpedoed her career  He did neither  though her time on  Letterman  was not a happy one  For that she places the blame on the boss  who later admitted on air that he d had affairs with underlings  He was far from the only man who helped make the comedy writing world so hostile to women  In  Just the Funny Parts   Scovell  whose résumé includes stints on many zeitgeist y shows  from  The Simpsons  to  Murphy Brown   catalogs the men who should have been comrades and instead were antagonists  It s not a short list  Early on  a comedy hero  Garry Shandling  told her   You write like a guy   and meant it as a positive No moment is too sacred to puncture  Scovell was invited to meet with Joss Whedon  the creator of  Buffy the Vampire Slayer    then her favorite show on TV   about a staff position  She was 38 weeks pregnant at the interview   Boy  are you fat   Whedon said   His producer followed up with   Should I put down a tarp    She didn t get the job If the sprinkling of sociological terms like  stereotype threat  sounds familiar  it s because Scovell collaborated with Sheryl Sandberg on her study laden blockbuster   Lean In   Sandberg  the Facebook executive  provides the TED Talk ready foreword to  Just the Funny Parts   writing that  whoever said feminists weren t funny never met Nell    At her own mother s funeral  Scovell  one of five siblings  held up an envelope and announced that it contained  the name of mom s favorite child    A career in the entertainment industry   scaled like a jungle gym  not a ladder   meant Scovell lived  Lean In  long before she wrote it  Sandberg says   Just the Funny Parts  is a record of her scramble  retrofitted with post  Lean In  indignation   She took Shandling s words as a compliment at first  The bar for contemporary women in comedy books was set in 2011 with Tina Fey s  Bossypants   which managed advice that was both hilarious and accurate   no pigtails or tube tops at the office  no diet foods in meetings and cry at work if you must because  it terrifies everyone   Scovell s lessons are less jokey and more emotionally bare  she even confesses a few things that our feminist foremothers have taught us to keep buttoned up   like the lines that she crossed  too   which feels freeing  Over all  though   Just the Funny Parts  functions best not when Scovell is recounting some backstage encounter on  The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour  or  Newhart  but when she s rankled  My first laugh came on Page 58  when Scovell  her contributions on a show once again ignored  asks a female co worker   Am I corporeal  You can see and hear me  right  Gender aside  her comedy bona fides are solid  Scovell is from a large  neurotic  bookish  mercilessly honest   though loving   Jewish family in Massachusetts  She went to Harvard and wrote for Spy magazine  With a few biographical tweaks  she could be Conan O Brien   The two intersected as writers on a short lived  80s talk show   In typical overachiever fashion  even her failures   Scovell writes that she was too full of self doubt to apply for The Harvard Lampoon   led her somewhere  She became a sportswriter for The Boston Globe  then moved to New York and got a staff job at Vanity Fair  But Scovell soon realized that her high concept style was better suited for TV   Writing for TV made way more sense than writing for magazines   she says   And by sense  I mean money  For aspiring writers  the book has just enough practical advice on story pitches and script editing to qualify as a how to   When I write  I feel like an optometrist  constantly flipping between lenses and asking   Is this better  Is this   Slowly  the work comes into focus   she explains  An appendix lists all of her jobs  from Lifetime movies to  NCIS   and  more bracingly for those starting out  the dozens of scripts unproduced over her 30 year career  Along the way  she married an architect and had two sons  and she is brisk about the fact that her husband s staying at home with the boys   carting them around to sets as she wrote  produced and directed   is what made her employable In her 40s and beyond  female executives kept her afloat  she says  Scovell built up a deep network of friends and allies  though strikingly  even in the photos of her gang  she is usually the only woman  The book is laid out like the old joke about the arc of a Hollywood career  Part 1   Who is Nell Scovell   Part 2   Get me Nell Scovell   Part 3   Get me a younger  cheaper Nell Scovell   And finally   Who is Nell Scovell  Just as she is getting to that last stage  however  she meets Sandberg  whose spirit infuses this book  in the references to studies about how men are perceived as confident while women are taught to deflect credit  or in the anecdotes about how Scovell is judged on her presumed emotions rather than her actual abilities  When the two women worked together on  Lean In   Scovell was overjoyed to find an outlet for her frustration   finally  here was data to back up her sense of inequity    and for the reader  that emotional shift comes not a moment too soon  as one thing that s sacrificed in her litany of miscreants is a larger sense of why she loves or even wants a career in entertainment anymore   Running a show is like being beaten to death with your own dream   a producer she worked with on the series she created   Sabrina the Teenage Witch   says There are career high points  too  I would have gladly read another chapter on the feminist platform presented by  Murphy Brown   But through connections made at Facebook   Lean In  brings an even more rarefied opportunity  writing jokes for President Obama  Finally  the payoff  Scovell is understandably giddy at crafting one liners for the White House Correspondents Dinner  to be delivered by the leader of the free world   a man who just happens to know how to land a punch line There s no time to wallow  now  in that era s ending  there s too much to fix  Though no doubt Scovell would have had it otherwise  the fact that  Just the Funny Parts  is landing at such a charged moment   when women are exquisitely  bruisingly fed up   may be a stroke of luck  In her introduction  Scovell does joke about calling the book  Just the Angry and Bitter Parts   but says she hoped not to outright discourage young writers  Besides  she adds   that would be an eight volume set  
Good Wednesday  Here s what we re watching   How foreign is Broadcom   The markets are worried that free trade has no voice at the White House   The E U  formally announced its plan for any Trump tariffs   Chuck Rosenberg  a former senior official at the Justice Department  is going to Crowell   Moring Want this in your inbox each morning  Sign up here As the Trump administration weighs whether to block the chip maker s  117 billion takeover bid for Qualcomm  a central issue is how much of a threat the deal is to national security  In an effort to assuage concerns  Broadcom pledged Wednesday to increase research spending on 5G wireless tech and to create a  1 5 billion fund to invest in training engineering talent in the United States to help allay those concerns The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States  or Cfius  has jurisdiction over the transaction because Broadcom is currently incorporated in Singapore  where the company has been legally headquartered since 2005  But the company is preparing to move its corporate base to the United States  in part to avoid being considered a foreign acquirer Beyond Broadcom s legal domicile  though  is it a substantially foreign company  Let s take a look at a number of factors SalesFirst  a caveat  Both Broadcom and Qualcomm categorize where their revenue based on the location to which the chips that go in the smartphones and other devices are delivered  As Qualcomm puts it  According to Broadcom s most recent annual report  roughly 7 percent of its  17 6 billion in net revenue comes from the United States  The single biggest market for the company is China  which accounted for roughly 54 percent of its net revenue   Other  markets made up nearly 38 percent As a point of comparison  2 percent of Qualcomm s revenues come from the United States  Some 65 percent of its revenue comes from China  including Hong Kong  according to its most recent annual report EmployeesRoughly 55 percent of Broadcom s employees are based in North America  according to the annual report  About 38 percent are in Asia  and the remainder work in Europe  the Middle East and Africa  About 52 percent of Qualcomm s employees are based in the United States Broadcom also said that about 62 percent of the square footage of its properties  both owned and leased  are in the United States  By contrast  Qualcomm has roughly 56 percent of its owned and leased facilities in the United States Corporate governanceThe vast majority of Broadcom s board are American citizens who live in the United States  That includes Jim Diller  its chairman  Henry Samueli  the founder of the original Broadcom  and Ken Hao  the Silver Lake partner who has backed Broadcom for years Hock Tan  the company s C E O   immigrated to the United States to attend M I T  and then Harvard Business School and lives in the San Francisco Bay Area  He became a naturalized citizen of the United States in 1990 Broadcom does have one Singaporean director  Check Low  to comply with Singapore s corporate rules OwnershipThe two companies share 11 of their top 20 shareholders  including big index fund managers like BlackRock and Vanguard   Michael de la MercedPresident Trump s top economic adviser finally announced he would leave  in a sign that the nationalists have won the White House debate on tariffs The news prompted Tom Nides  Morgan Stanley s vice chairman  to utter aloud   Oh  that s a problem  More on Mr  Cohn s decision from Kate Kelly and Maggie Haberman of the NYT  who broke the news yesterday Potential replacements  according to Axios  Peter Navarro  the trade adviser who pushed for the tariffs  Kevin Warsh  the former Fed governor  Shahira Knight  a deputy of Mr  Cohn s  and the pro free trade economist Larry Kudlow  But Axios says that there s no official succession plan  and that other members of the National Economic Council will likely leave  We can rule out Austan Goolsbee  The timing  CNBC notes that Mr  Cohn s announcement came hours after Mr  Trump said that  everyone wants to work in the White House   It also came after Mr  Trump tweeted   There is no Chaos  only great Energy  Peter Eavis s take  Even if there is no plunge  now is a moment for investors to make up their minds about populism Critics  corner  The WSJ editorial board said Mr  Cohn s departure was  a significant blow  to Mr  Trump s presidency  The NYT editorial board said Mr  Cohn had done  an awful job   which still probably represented  the high water mark for economic thinking  for this White House  And his former boss  Lloyd Blankfein  said he had served his country  in a first class way  The Federal Reserve has helped support the economy when a big event   fears for the survival of the euro  fiscal standoffs in Congress  oil price declines   threatens to dampen growth  But will the Fed have the same leeway to stimulate the economy if rising trade tensions start to weigh on the growth prospects of the United States Maybe not The Fed had ample room to keep its policy loose when inflation was dormant for years after the financial crisis  But now that inflation seems to be waking up  the Fed might not have the same flexibility  Indeed  amid the current trade tumult  investors still seem to believe that inflation is moving higher  This can be seen in a closely watched bond market indicator flagged this morning by Lisa Abramowicz of Bloomberg One outcome  The concerns about a trade war may end up weighing on growth and causing the inflationary pressures to abate  That would give the Fed more room to maneuver  perhaps allowing it to raise interest rates more slowly But it could get messy  Trade tariffs  applied broadly  could push up the prices of many goods at a time when the Fed has to grapple with the enormous fiscal stimulus that Congress just enacted   Peter EavisFederal Reserve governor Lael Brainard became the latest policymaker to express confidence that inflation would hit the Fed s target of 2 percent this year What are those tailwinds Ms  Brainard s comments are notable because she had previously argued vocally for caution in tightening monetary policy Major stocks indexes in the United States are down a bit  The Dow Jones industrial average and the S  P  500 are both off just over 0 5 percent  Futures fell more than 1 percent in the hours after the news broke Despite the muted response  a number of analysts are warning that investors need to prepare for the possibility that more protectionist populist policies are on the way  Here s a look at some reactions Joe Brusuelas  the chief economist at RSM US  wrote  Brian Gardner and Michael Michaud  analysts at Keefe  Bruyette   Woods  wrote  What does that mean  The analysts said they think the United States is more likely than not to withdraw from Nafta Charlie McElligott at Nomura Securities wrote  But he adds Between Feb  12 and Feb  22  the billionaire investor sold about  31 million of the crane maker s stock To some  that seemed like good timing Since the day before he started selling  the stock is down 20 percent  The catalyst  The Trump administration s plans to slap tariffs on imported steel and aluminum  Manitowoc stock fell 4 8 percent on Feb  16 when Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross unveiled a report calling for tariffs on imported steel  The company s shares then dropped 6 percent Thursday when President Trump announced his plan On Wednesday  Mr  Icahn said he had no knowledge of the Trump administration s plans when he moved to reduce his holding  In a statement on his website  Mr  Icahn said The political bloc formally announced its plan to counterattack  including taxing American goods like Harley Davidsons and bourbon and filing a challenge with the World Trade Organization Meanwhile  allies continued to fret  South Korea worries that tariffs will complicate its efforts to denuclearize the North  Christine Lagarde of the I M F  warned of the perils of a trade war  And fellow Republicans in Washington continued to lobby the White House The aluminum industry doesn t want tariffs eitherIn a letter to the White House yesterday  the Aluminum Association  which represents both U S  and foreign suppliers  said that the move would be a bad idea Complaints can be heard around the sector  The C E O  of Novelis  a big aluminum producer  criticized Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross for saying predictions of price increases were  hysteria   And DowDuPont said it might now build plants in Canada or Argentina rather than the U S Bayer said it is in exclusive talks with BASF about the sale of its entire vegetable seeds business as the German chemicals multinational  seeks to win approval for its  56 billion deal for Monsanto from European regulators European antitrust regulators opened an in depth investigation into Bayer s planned acquisition of Monsanto  its American agribusiness rival  in August  European competition authorities are expected to wrap up their inquiry by early next month The proposed combination is the latest in a series of mergers in the rapidly consolidating seed and agrochemical sector Bayer previously agreed to sell selected businesses with its Crop Sciences unit to BASF for 5 9 billion euros  or about  7 3 billion at current exchange rates  in October  Both deals  if one were to be reached on the vegetable seeds business  would be subject to the Monsanto transaction closing   Chad BrayMr  Rosenberg had a long career in government  twice U S  attorney  he s been a longtime senior

 Oh my god  this is so cute  Robin Li  an investor with the San Francisco venture capital firm GGV Capital  was standing in the lobby of the Madison building in downtown Detroit  Built in 1917 as a theater and refurbished several years ago as a tech co working space  the Madison checks all of the aesthetic boxes of hipsterdom  reclaimed wood  exposed brick walls  pour over coffee served by tattooed baristas  This is nicer than San Francisco   Ms  Li concluded Last month  I accompanied Ms  Li and roughly a dozen other venture capitalists on a three day bus trip through the Midwest  with stops in Youngstown and Akron  Ohio  Detroit and Flint  Mich   and South Bend  Ind  The trip  which took place on a luxury bus outfitted with a supply of vegan doughnuts and coal infused kombucha  was known as the  Comeback Cities Tour  It was pitched as a kind of Rust Belt safari   a chance for Silicon Valley investors to meet local officials and look for promising start ups in overlooked areas of the country But a funny thing happened  By the end of the tour  the coastal elites had caught the heartland bug  Several used Zillow  the real estate app  to gawk at the availability of cheap homes in cities like Detroit and South Bend and fantasize about relocating there  They marveled at how even old line manufacturing cities now offer a convincing simulacrum of coastal life  complete with artisanal soap stores and farm to table restaurants  If it weren t for my kids  I d totally move   said Cyan Banister  a partner at Founders Fund   This could be a really powerful ecosystem  These investors aren t alone  In recent months  a growing number of tech leaders have been flirting with the idea of leaving Silicon Valley  Some cite the exorbitant cost of living in San Francisco and its suburbs  where even a million dollar salary can feel middle class  Others complain about local criticism of the tech industry and a left wing echo chamber that stifles opposing views  And yet others feel that better innovation is happening elsewhere  I m a little over San Francisco   said Patrick McKenna  the founder of High Ridge Venture Partners who was also on the bus tour   It s so expensive  it s so congested  and frankly  you also see opportunities in other places  Mr  McKenna  who owns a house in Miami in addition to his home in San Francisco  told me that his travels outside the Bay Area had opened his eyes to a world beyond the tech bubble  Every single person in San Francisco is talking about the same things  whether it s  I hate Trump  or  I m going to do blockchain and Bitcoin    he said   It s the worst part of the social network  The tour through the Midwest was organized by Representative Tim Ryan  a Democrat who represents northeastern Ohio  Representative Ro Khanna  a Democrat who represents Silicon Valley  came along for the ride  as did J  D  Vance  the author of  Hillbilly Elegy    Mr  Vance  a venture capitalist who now seems to magically appear every time the words  Midwest  and  manufacturing  are spoken aloud  has also been leading his own whistle stop tours of the region   Read more here about Mr  Vance scouring the Midwest  Recently  Peter Thiel  the President Trump supporting billionaire investor and Facebook board member  became Silicon Valley s highest profile defector when he reportedly told people close to him that he was moving to Los Angeles full time  and relocating his personal investment funds there   Founders Fund and Mithril Capital  two other firms started by Mr  Thiel  will remain in the Bay Area   Mr  Thiel reportedly considered San Francisco s progressive culture  toxic   and sought out a city with more intellectual diversity Mr  Thiel s criticisms were echoed by Michael Moritz  the billionaire founder of Sequoia Capital  In a recent Financial Times op ed  Mr  Moritz argued that Silicon Valley had become slow and spoiled by its success  and that  soul sapping discussions  about politics and social injustice had distracted tech companies from the work of innovation Complaints about Silicon Valley insularity are as old as the Valley itself  Jim Clark  the co founder of Netscape  famously decamped for Florida during the first dot com era  complaining about high taxes and expensive real estate  Steve Case  the founder of AOL  has pledged to invest mostly in start ups outside the Bay Area  saying that  we ve probably hit peak Silicon Valley  But even among those who enjoy living in the Bay Area  and can afford to do so comfortably  there s a feeling that success has gone to the tech industry s head  Some of the engineers in the Valley have the biggest egos known to humankind   Mr  Khanna  the Silicon Valley congressman  said during a round table discussion with officials in Youngstown   If they don t have their coffee and breakfast and dry cleaning  they want to go somewhere else  Whereas here  people are hungry  This isn t a full blown exodus yet  But in the last three months of 2017  San Francisco lost more residents to outward migration than any other city in the country  according to data from Redfin  the real estate website  A recent survey by Edelman  the public relations firm  found that 49 percent of Bay Area residents  and 58 percent of Bay Area millennials  were considering moving away  And a sharp increase in people moving out of the Bay Area has led to a shortage of moving vans   According to local news reports  renting a U Haul for a one way trip from San Jose to Las Vegas now costs roughly  2 000  compared with just  100 for a truck going the other direction  For both investors and rank and file workers  one appeal of noncoastal cities is the obvious cost savings  It s increasingly difficult to justify doling out steep salaries and lavish perks demanded by engineers in the Bay Area  when programmers in other cities can be had for as little as  50 000 a year   An entry level engineer at Facebook or Google might command triple or quadruple that amount  When you invest in a San Francisco start up   you re basically paying landlords  Twilio  and Amazon Web Services   said Ms  Bannister of Founders Fund  referring to the companies that provide start ups with messaging services and data hosting Granted  California still has its perks  Venture capital investment is still largely concentrated on the West Coast  as are the clusters of talented computer scientists who emerge from prestigious schools like Stanford and the University of California  Berkeley  Despite the existence of tools like Slack  which make remote work easier  many tech workers feel it s still an advantage to be close to the center of the action But the region s advantages may be eroding  Google  Facebook and other large tech companies have recently opened offices in cities like Boulder  Colo  and Boston  hoping to attract new talent as well as accommodating requests from existing employees looking to move elsewhere  And the hot demand for engineers in areas like artificial intelligence and autonomous vehicles has led companies to expand their presence near research universities  in cities like Pittsburgh and Ann Arbor  Then there is HQ2  Amazon s much ballyhooed search for a second headquarters  which seems to have convinced some tech executives that cities between the coasts may be viable alternatives Venture capitalists  who recognize a bargain when they see one  have already begun scouring the Midwest  Mr  Case and Mr  Vance recently amassed a  150 million fund called  Rise of the Rest   The fund  which was backed by tech luminaries including Jeff Bezos of Amazon and Eric Schmidt  the former executive chairman of Alphabet  will invest in start ups throughout the region  Read Andrew Ross Sorkin on the Rise of the Rest fund  But it s not just about making money  It s about social comfort  too  Tech companies are more popular in noncoastal states than in their own backyards  where the industry s effect on housing prices and traffic congestion is more acutely felt  Most large tech companies still rate highly in national opinion surveys  but only 62 percent of Californians say they trust the tech industry  and just 37 percent trust social media companies  according to the Edelman survey  So you can start to understand the appeal of a friendlier environment During the Akron stop of the bus trip  while the Silicon

NEW YORK    Nervous stock investors are hoping an unusually U S  strong earnings season can restore some of the optimism that characterized equity markets last year Imploding technology stocks and fears of a trade war have pummeled the market in recent days  Given the surge in volatility this year  there is no guarantee that worst is over Analysts predict strong results when reporting season starts up next month  with first quarter S P 500 profit growth on track to be the highest in seven years  according to Thomson Reuters data  That follows a blockbuster fourth quarter period  and recent corporate tax cuts that boosted forecasts for all of 2018 A robust earnings period would bring back the focus on fundamentals and possibly put a floor under prices  supporting views that the 9 year old bull market will go on  strategists said  It s going to be earnings   said Robert Pavlik  chief investment strategist and senior portfolio manager at SlateStone Wealth LLC in New York   The market has given up so much that earnings can start to redirect attention back into a market that has gotten much cheaper relative to where we were  With this year s sell off and rising profit forecasts  stocks also are near the cheapest on a price to earnings basis that they have been since late 2016  The S P 500 is trading at about 16 5 times forward earnings  well below the 18 9 level it was at in mid December  according to Thomson Reuters data  To view a graphic on S P PEs  click https   tmsnrt rs 2E5ntYM Stocks  rout in early February  and more recent selling following worries over a U S  trade war with China  Facebook privacy issues and a collapse in other tech leaders  have made investors skittish and more likely to discount the relatively strong economic backdrop that persists  We ve been caught up in all of these things that could happen and may happen and that the sky is falling  but once earnings season kicks in  it s headline news and that steals away some of the negativity   said Daniel Morgan  senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust Company in Atlanta To be sure  next week brings the monthly U S  jobs report  a potential catalyst for further volatility  A strong payrolls report in early February had helped spark the stock sell off that drove the S P 500 more than 10 percent below its Jan  26 record high   a  correction  The job report briefly drove up bond yields and touched off worries that the Federal Reserve may need to speed up interest rate hikes  The S P 500 is now about 8 percent below its record Just in the first three months of this year  the S P has jumped or fallen 1 percent on 23 trading days  three times the number of 1 percent moves it made in all of 2017  In 2016  there were 48 such days Market participants agree that U S  stocks are unlikely to return to the unusually calm conditions seen last year  when the Cboe Volatility Index  the most widely followed barometer of expected near term ups and downs for the S P 500  logged a record low daily average reading of 11  The VIX hit a two and a half year high above 50 in early February Expectations for U S  earnings this year have jumped since December  when U S  lawmakers approved sweeping changes to the tax law  including slashing the corporate tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent  Growth in other major economies has also lifted profit forecasts for the large stocks that generate a lot of sales overseas Analysts now expect first quarter earnings for S P 500 companies to rise 18 5 percent from a year ago  according to Thomson Reuters data The first quarter S P profit forecast is up 6 3 percentage points since Jan  1  while the forecast for all of 2018 is up 7 7 points since then  based on Thomson Reuters data That suggests the bar might be relatively low for the first quarter   You still could see some relative upside there   said Keith Parker  U S  equity strategist at UBS Many companies already have announced plans for increased buybacks and dividends  or bringing cash back from overseas  and other ways to use their tax savings  More news on that front is expected this reporting period  which is set to start with reports from JPMorgan Chase and others April 13  If we get a discussion of repatriation   what companies are going to bring back     that will have a positive effect on the market   said Bucky Hellwig  senior vice president at BB T Wealth Management in Birmingham  Alabama  Reporting by Caroline Valetkevitch  additional reporting by Saqib Iqbal Ahmed  editing by Alden Bentley and Nick Zieminski 
LONDON    European investors have raised their bond allocations in March while keeping their equity exposure at six month lows  in a month marked by a sharp tech sector selloff and brewing trade tensions that threatened to dent world economic growth Reuters  monthly survey of 21 European asset managers showed average bond holdings rose 1 4 percentage points on the month to 42 1 percent  the highest since August 2017  while exposure to euro zone debt rose more than five percentage points to 59 1 percent  also a seven month high U S  debt allocations rose to 20 7 percent  the highest since last September  up from 18 2 percent in February The poll was conducted between March 15 28  a period when the FAANG group of U S  technology firms   Facebook  Apple  Amazon  Netflix and Alphabet s Google   saw a hefty reversal that took the S P 500 s tech index down more than 10 percent on the month It also coincided with U S  President Donald Trump announcing  60 billion in tariffs on Chinese goods  alongside levies on steel and aluminium imports from several countries The fears of tit for tat protectionist tariffs and trade wars burst on to markets just as softer purchasing manager surveys seemed to imply that economic growth  at least in the developed world  might be peaking That s especially so in the euro zone where economic sentiment has slipped for three straight months and Citi s economic surprise index has tumbled into negative territory after a long period on positive ground Two thirds of the fund managers who answered a question on the topic thought euro zone economic growth had already peaked in this cycle  though they saw a sharp deterioration as unlikely Accordingly  the share of euro zone stocks in equity portfolios slipped to 29 7 percent   the second lowest level since November 2014  poll data showed  Euro zone growth has most likely peaked   Colin Harte  head of research and portfolio manager at BNP Paribas Asset Management said  though he added   We do not expect it to fall sharply over the balance of 2018 early 2019  unless the world experiences a trade war  Most expected regional growth to stay above potential  noting ultra low borrowing costs even if the European Central Bank ends its bond purchase programme this year  A  growth  peak is not what matters  What will be key is the ability of not decelerating too quickly  In this regard  there are no signs that a strong deceleration is on the cards   said Francois Savary  chief investment officer of Swiss wealth manager Prime Partners Trade could be the unknown factor  however  Asked whether an all out trade war would hurt the dollar or boost it  just over half of those who responded predicted a weakening in the greenback  while a third expected it to strengthen The dollar is ending March with its fifth straight quarter of losses against a basket of currencies Widening U S  budget deficits are undermining the dollar despite some support from higher interest rates  said Amundi s  chief investment officer Pascal Blanque  who noted that trade tensions in 1982 84 and 2001 had caused dollar depreciation  A full scale global trade war  with retaliation actions among trading partners  would undermine confidence  threaten the global recovery  and would push the dollar in the direction of further weakening   Blanque added The U S  Federal Reserve raised interest rates this month and is seen repeating that twice more this year  and possibly three times if the jobs picture continues to improve Fund managers who replied to a survey question on the subject were evenly divided as to whether rates would rise a total of three or four times in 2018 Paolo Zanghieri  senior economist at Generali Investments  was in the latter camp  noting the robust labour market  even if the Fed s March projections showed three moves  It would take an upgrade of projections by just one FOMC member to tilt the median to four hikes  and we expect this to happen at the June meeting  on the back of stronger readings for inflation and real activity   he said  Additional reporting by Claire Milhench and Maria Pia Quaglia  Editing by Hugh Lawson 
LONDON    Spooked by brewing trade tensions and a broad reversal in technology shares  global investors have cut their equity exposure to a four month low this month while reducing their holdings of U S  stocks to the lowest in nearly two years Reuters  monthly asset allocation poll of 53 wealth managers and chief investment officers in Europe  the United States  Britain and Japan was carried out from March 12 to 27 During this period  U S  moves to slap tariffs on steel and aluminium imports  and on up to  60 billion of Chinese goods  sent world stocks to six week lows Investors have been worried that tit for tat retaliatory measures from China and a deterioration in world trade could hinder economic global  prompting a sharp risk off move in markets  Trade tariffs     while they should not end up in a full blown trade war  risk weighing on market sentiment just when liquidity is diminishing and financial conditions are expected to tighten   said Pascal Blanque  chief investment officer at Amundi In the poll  investors cut their equity holdings by almost 1 percentage point to 48 1 percent of global balanced portfolios    the lowest level since November    while raising bond holdings by 2 3 percentage points to 39 3 percent Within equity portfolios  managers cut their U S  exposure to 38 percent  the lowest since April 2016 U S  stocks look set to end the month down 4 percent  hammered by trade war fears and worries about tighter regulation for the tech sector after a furore over the use of Facebook data by political consultants Peter Lowman  chief investment officer at Investment Quorum  said it had been a testing time for equity investors  and articulated the threat to the U S  economy and consumer of a trade war  U S  companies operating in China would be affected whether it is Apple or a U S  car manufacturer   he said  adding that Chinese exports to the United States improved the American standard of living through the provision of cheaper goods FALLOUT FEARSA 62 percent majority of poll participants who answered a question on the outlook for the U S  dollar in the event of a full scale trade war said that it would weaken The dollar hit a five week low against a basket of six other major currencies in March Raphael Gallardo  a strategist at Natixis Asset Management  said that while first round effects  such as a reduction in the U S  trade deficit  might initially strengthen the dollar  ultimately it would weaken due to retaliation by U S  trading partners  More importantly  the trade war triggered by tariffs would end up weakening further the prospective rate of return on investment in the U S    he said The outlook for the dollar is complicated by the fact that the U S  Federal Reserve is raising rates  targeting at least two more hikes for 2018 after a 25 basis points hike in March A slim 56 percent majority of poll participants who answered a question on this topic expected three rate hikes this year  but a third opted for four  saying the Fed was behind the curve Several noted it would take just one FOMC member to upgrade their expectations to tilt the Fed s median projection from three to four hikes for the year  The 2018 dot plot is more hawkish than the median three hikes imply   said Jan Bopp  an investment strategist at J Safra Sarasin   The 2018 call was a close one  and the move up in 2019 and beyond was clearly a reflection of the strengthening of the economic outlook  GROWTH CATALYSTSThere was less consensus over the outlook for the euro zone economy  with just 51 percent of poll participants who answered a question on this saying growth had not yet peaked in the current cycle  While inflation expectations have peaked short term and German industrial activity has slowed  cheap financing will continue to be a driver as well as the robust global trade environment   said Jean Medecin  a member of the investment committee at Carmignac  Euro zone businesses rounded off the first quarter of 2018 with their slowest growth in over a year and economic sentiment data has underwhelmed European equities look set to end the month down around 2 3 percent In the poll  investors cut their euro zone equity holdings slightly to 19 9 percent  but while some investors said growth might be slowing  with the stronger euro hampering export growth  it would not fall sharply  Growth catalysts like low real interest rates are still very much with us  so growth levels could remain above trend near term   said Peter van der Welle  a strategist at Robeco  Reporting by Claire Milhench  additional reporting by Maria Pia Quaglia and Hari Kishan  Editing by Hugh Lawson 
How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives  Ian Austen  a correspondent who is based in Ottawa  discussed the tech he s using How do Canadians differ from Americans in the ways they use tech  and what are the most popular homegrown apps there Many of the apps on Canadians  phones would be familiar to any American   they generally include Facebook  YouTube  Snapchat  Instagram and Twitter  I m leery of cross country comparisons because they often mix survey samples and methods  But they suggest that Canadians spend somewhat more time online  and on Facebook  than Americans That would follow  In the pre internet age  Canadians were often world champions when it came to long distance telephone use  something that could be accurately measured  It s a big and sparsely settled country There are some hometown apps  Some are predictable  Canadian banks  large Canadian retail stores  Canadian news organizations  although The Times also has a large following here  and Canadian loyalty programs  But others are more surprising  Kijiji  not Craigslist  dominates online classifieds here  It s owned by eBay and bombed when it was also tried in the United States What are your favorite tech tools for doing your job  My two main tools also seem to be with nearly every other reporter surrounding me in media rooms at events  a MacBook Pro and an iPhone 7  Whatever harms they ve brought to society and general human interaction  few things have made my job easier than smartphones Right now  I m also experimenting with Trint  an app that shows promise at taking over the transcribing of interviews  the most dispiriting part of an otherwise great job  It s a bit expensive  and  right now at least  its accuracy swings wildly from being very impressive to producing something that resembles experimental prose poetry  But there aren t any obvious factors behind its hits or misses  like the quality of the recording or the subjects  accents Like the three other Times reporters who cover Canada  I work throughout the country  So in my  untidy  office in Ottawa I keep a work backpack ready for leaving town  My one tip for anyone who travels frequently on short notice is to buy a second laptop charging brick and keep it in your travel pack  Yes  I came to that solution the hard way Along with my laptop  a Leica M  Typ 262  camera and three or four lenses go into my backpack when I head out to the airport or the car  Photos supplement my notes and voice recordings  They also make their way into the weekly Canada Letter that I write  please subscribe   and they sometimes illustrate my articles A lot of people use a smartphone for photography  Why bother carrying a dedicated camera The adage that the best camera in the world is the one you have with you is completely true  Most smartphones can produce very nice images  and I certainly use my phone s camera  But squeezing a camera into a phone brings many compromises Their incredibly small image sensors don t match up to those in dedicated cameras  especially when the light is low  The tiny sensors also mean that you can t really take advantage of the different perspectives that different focal lengths of lenses offer on dedicated cameras  Composing on a screen held away from your face is far from ideal  and if you learn about photography  controlling the exposure and focus of the camera become a big part of it I ve used Leicas on and off since I was in high school  and its rangefinder cameras  of which mine is a recent digital version  were once synonymous with photojournalism and documentary photographers like Robert Frank and Henri Cartier Bresson  Leicas are more compact than any comparable digital single lens reflex camera  and I prefer the clarity of their optical viewfinders over the magnified electronic ones of other mirrorless digital cameras  They re also much more discreet when taking photos during interviews Film still has a few tricks that digital can t match  and I often also take an old Leica or another film camera along on trips Beyond your job  what tech product are you currently obsessed with using in your daily life I drink far too much tea  so the Breville One Touch tea maker keeps me supplied and maintains productivity at the bureau  which is the fancy term for a space in the basement of my house in Ottawa We also came into an Instant Pot  the surprisingly successful creation of Ottawa s tech industry  My colleague in Cooking Melissa Clark is best placed to tell you all about the wonders of the amped up pressure cooker Cycling is a big part of my life  Last year  I became the last person in my branch of the cycling world to get a GPS computer for my bikes that also measures  among other things  my heart rate  It was joined by a similar watch I use while running and cross country skiing  the winter activity for cyclists around here Google s sister company Sidewalk Labs intends to remake Toronto in a high tech image  What do you think about the plans There isn t even a plan yet  Sidewalk is spending the next year doing consultations and coming up with a final design that will need government approval  But it has already put out an ambitious list of what it hopes to build  As now proposed  the plan involves a perhaps unprecedented level of data collection from people going about their daily lives  Dealing with the obvious privacy concerns that flow from that may prove to be its greatest challenge What is Canada s high tech scene like now  BlackBerry has foundered  but Canada has a lot of well known artificial intelligence researchers  especially in Toronto It s now bigger and expanding more quickly than it was at any point during BlackBerry s glory years  Except for Instant Pot  however  not a lot of what goes on in Canada is directly connected to consumer products Several of those researchers at Canadian universities were A I  pioneers  and that has directly played a role in turning Toronto and Montreal  particularly  into centers for that work  Canada s immigration rules  which make it quick and easy to bring in skilled workers  have also been a major factor and spurred growth in Ottawa  Kitchener Waterloo  Ontario  Calgary  Alberta  and Vancouver  British Columbia  As for BlackBerry  it s still around  even if it s much smaller and no longer makes phones 
NEW YORK    Stocks around the world plunged Friday as investors feared that a trade conflict between the U S  and China  the biggest economies in the world  would escalate  A second day of big losses pushed U S  stocks to their worst week in two years Investors fear that if China responds in kind to sanctions on  60 billion worth of Chinese imports the White House announced on Thursday  it will be a first step toward a full blown trade war that could damage the global economy and slash profits at big U S  exporters like Apple and Boeing The market s two biggest sectors slumped the most  Technology stocks have made enormous gains over the past year  but since they do so much business outside the U S   investors see them as particularly vulnerable in a trade dispute  The sector dropped 7 9 percent this week Banks also fell sharply  Amid the trade war rumblings  investors fled to the safety of bonds and drove down yields  a potential negative for bank profits  That marked a reversal from earlier in the week  when banks rose as the Federal Reserve raised interest rates It wound up being the worst week for U S  indexes since January 2016  The S P 500 index sank 6 percent  Among notable decliners was Facebook  which lost 13 9 percent  or  68 billion in value  as outrage mounted over its handling of user data  That s about as much as the company was worth in in 2012  the year of its initial public offering Stocks sagged at the start of this month after tariffs on aluminum and steel were announced  but they quickly recovered as the administration said the tariffs wouldn t be as severe as they first looked  The losses this week were worse  and investors are hoping for hints the sanctions on China are more of a negotiating tactic  There could be a possibility of a bounce back if  as this progresses  both sides look like they re negotiating   said Lisa Erickson  chief investment officer at U S  Bank Wealth Management   There could be further decline if people get a sense there could be more trade restrictions in place  The S P 500 index dropped 55 43 points  or 2 1 percent  to 2 588 26 on Friday  The Dow Jones industrial average lost 424 69 points  or 1 8 percent  to 23 533 20  The Nasdaq composite fell 174 01 points  or 2 4 percent  to 6 992 67 Germany s DAX lost 1 8 percent and the French CAC 40 fell 1 4 percent  The FTSE 100 in Britain dipped 0 4 percent  Japan s benchmark Nikkei 225 index plunged 4 5 percent and South Korea s Kospi tumbled 3 2 percent  Hong Kong s Hang Seng lost 2 5 percent Big U S  companies tend to get more of their revenue from foreign customers than small companies do  and that makes them more vulnerable to damage from a trade war  With nearly 1 4 billion people  China is a big market for the largest U S  businesses Not every company breaks out how much of its revenue comes from abroad  but FactSet estimates that 30 5 percent of revenue at big companies in the S P 500 comes from outside the United States  For the smaller companies in the S P 600 index  it s just 19 5 percent  Smaller companies are also getting a bigger benefit from the recent cut in corporate tax rates  We think a lot of the areas in the market with the greatest potential for earnings improvement this year are small  and mid cap stocks  things that have the biggest benefit from tax reform and are less subject to trade wars   said Eric Marshall  portfolio manager at Hodges mutual funds The Russell 2000 index of smaller company stocks sank 33 79 points  or 2 2 percent  to 1 510 08  but it s flat this month while the S P 500 is down 4 6 percent Sales outside the U S  are especially important for technology companies  Roughly  1 of every  5 in Apple s sales came from China  Hong Kong and Taiwan in its last year  That doesn t take into account how much of the manufacturing and assembly of Apple products is done in Chinese factories  which could be affected if trade restrictions start piling up  On Friday chipmakers fared especially badly Investors kept buying bonds  sending prices higher and yields lower  The yield on the 10 year Treasury note slipped to 2 81 percent from 2 83 percent In another sign investors are nervous  gold and silver prices jumped  Gold climbed  22 50  or 1 7 percent  to  1 349 90 an ounce and silver gained 20 cents  or 1 2 percent  to  16 58 an ounce  The dollar fell to 104 82 yen from 105 61 yen  The euro rose to  1 2367 from  1 2307 Defense contractors including Raytheon and Lockheed Martin climbed after President Donald Trump signed a new government funding bill that provides increases in military spending  He had tweeted a threat to veto the measure The price of oil climbed  1 58  or 2 5 percent  to  65 88 a barrel in New York  Brent crude  the international standard for oil prices  added  1 54  or 2 2 percent  to  70 45 a barrel in London Wholesale gasoline rose 2 cents to  2 04 a gallon  Heating oil added 3 cents to  2 02 a gallon  Natural gas dipped 3 cents to  2 59 per 1 000 cubic feet Copper fell 3 cents to  2 99 a pound     Stan Choe contributed from New York  Kelvin Chan contributed from Hong Kong and Pan Pylas contributed from London 
Good Tuesday  Here s what we re watching   Gary Cohn is exiting the White House   Why Cfius thinks Broadcom s bid for Qualcomm is a national security matter  A top aluminum lobbying group argues against tariffs  Should mutual funds become activists on guns   Could the Trump tariffs be weakened Want this in your inbox every morning  Sign up here Will the gains investors have made under President Trump now walk out the door  too Mr  Cohn was an influential figure in the White House  As the president s top economic adviser  he opposed policies  like the tariffs announced last week  that go against the prevailing global economic order  Now that Mr  Cohn is leaving  investors may fear that Mr  Trump and others in his administration will step up their assault on globalism  stoking the chances of a trade war and other tensions that damage the real economy Mr  Cohn has telegraphed his unhappiness with some of President Trump s policies  so his departure may not come as a surprise to investors  They also may believe that the chaos in the White House will limit the administration s ability to deliver on policies investors don t like  And of course  investors may hope that Mr  Trump  unwilling to see the stock market s gains unwind  stays his hand  It s even possible that Mr  Trump will keep talking to Mr  Cohn after he leaves  or that he will replace Mr  Cohn with someone with similar views  like Larry Kudlow Still  the Dow Jones industrial average may open sharply down on Wednesday morning  The markets were rattled in August when there were rumors that Mr  Cohn might resign  And futures markets on Tuesday evening pointed to a lower open But even if there is no plunge  now is a moment for investors to make up their minds about populism For two years  the markets have consistently shrugged off everything from Britain s departure from the European Union to the election of Mr  Trump to the rise of non mainstream parties in Europe  Investors could look the other way because global growth was picking up  and Mr  Trump was introducing pro business policies like tax cuts and deregulation But investors and populists are entwined in a way that is not obvious  Right now  economies are suffering from what could be called  Toxic Goldilocks Syndrome   The stimulus of central banks has delivered moderate economic growth and steady returns for investors that keep them happy  At the same time  though  the central bank s policies have struggled to solve deeper problems like income inequality and low labor market participation  As these persist  they provide fuel for populist candidates What could change now With Mr  Cohn leaving  one of Mr  Trump s policies may end up causing real economic damage  That s a concern of investors  at least  But then much depends on how the Federal Reserve responds  If  say  Mr  Trump s tariffs dampened growth this year  the Fed might choose to raise interest rates once  rather than three times  in effect helping investors and the White House But there is a much brighter scenario  Despite the deeper economic problems and the tumult over trade  growth picks up to a level that causes a real bump in wages this year  and Mr  Trump decides to bask in that success  rather than aiming a wrecking ball at the international economic order But who s around now to make that argument   Peter EavisCfius said that Broadcom s proposed deal to acquire rival chip maker Qualcomm could pose a national security risk and called for a full investigation into the hostile bid  according to a letter from a United States Treasury official The letter goes on to say The move complicates an already contentious deal  increasing the likelihood that Broadcom will end its pursuit of Qualcomm  Such investigations are often death knells for corporate deals Cfius said that the potential risk was related to Broadcom s relationships with foreign entities A spokesman for Broadcom told DealBook in a statement   we are fully cooperating with Cfius  Michael s takeThough Cfius stressed the importance of protecting national security  relatively little of the letter focused on explaining traditional matters of national security  Though the document mentioned Broadcom s  relationships with third party foreign entities   it does not go into detail about those ties The letter does note that descriptions of national security concerns are largely classified  But it makes no mention of Qualcomm s publicly disclosed partnerships with Huawei  the Chinese rival long considered closely tied to Beijing  on the 5G standard  either What Cfius appears capable of describing publicly is concern about how Broadcom might manage Qualcomm after a successful takeover  The government panel describes Broadcom s potential approach as akin to  private equity   referring to the company s well known penchant for cutting costs to help drive profits To the government  that could pose dangers for Qualcomm s edge in advancing 5G technology  The chip maker is considered  along with Huawei  to be one of the two leading developers of the superfast wireless standard  and any potential disruption to its business could mean ceding an important advantage to the Chinese  Cfius writes Cfius s letter also notes that Qualcomm supplies the United States government with important products  and consults on cybersecurity matters relating to 5G and the internet of things  Any disruption of that work  the panel writes   could have a detrimental impact on national security  Another take from a friend of DealBookHere are tweets by Steven Davidoff Solomon  long known as our colleague the Deal Professor   Michael de la MercedPresident Trump said that he is thinking of putting tariffs on imported aluminum and steel to protect the domestic metal industries  But in a letter to the White House today  the Aluminum Association said that the move would be a bad idea From the group s letter  signed by its C E O   Heidi Brock In the letter  the association says that more narrowly targeted tariffs on Chinese production   which would be more akin to what previous administrations have done   and exemptions for trading partners like Canada and the E U  would be better Worth noting   The association s website says that it represents both U S  and foreign suppliers   Michael de la MercedPolicy flyaround  Treasury Secretary

In the fall of 2015  Nina Lorez Collins  a former literary agent  writer and mother of four young adults  including a pair of twins  was experiencing a fairly typical middle aged malaise  She had a complicated second marriage  and her body was betraying her   textbook perimenopausal stuff  awaking most nights at 3 a m   heart pounding  soaked in sweat  When she Googled  perimenopause   it amused her to read that one of the symptoms was  impending sense of doom   and she noted her discovery in an uncomplicated  until recently  manner  a Facebook post Friends wrote back  half seriously  suggesting she start a group for their cohort  but what to call it  Black Cohosh  for the herbal remedy   How about What Would Virginia Woolf Do  one friend joked darkly  because of course what Woolf did  at 59  was kill herself Within a week or so  Ms  Collins  now 48  had created a secret Facebook group with just that title  inviting her friends into the internet era s version of a consciousness raising group  where women of a certain age could talk about things they didn t want to share with husbands  partners or children That would be everything from the peevishly quotidian  complaints about dry skin or men not shutting cabinets  to the truly harrowing  suicide ideation  job loss at middle age  bad marriages  domestic abuse  and children suffering from drug addiction  And sex  There would be lots of chatter around sex  requests for tips on technique  concern about  the handful of limp  of an older boyfriend  vaginal atrophy  dry vaginas  sex toys  bad sex  no sex  anal sex  the viability of hiring a male prostitute  who has an orgasm first during sex  weird places to have sex  obligatory sex  sex with an ex  tantric sex  group sex  and many  many posts about coconut oil  see  dry vaginas   above  Ms  Collins  who lives in Brooklyn Heights in a modish duplex apartment overlooking the East River  is emblematic of a certain demographic  mostly white   though Ms  Collins is half black   expensively educated and housed liberals  You would assume that group would mirror itself online and stay small and homogeneous  But within a year of its founding  WWVWD  to use its colloquial abbreviation  had more than 1 300 members  the week after the presidential election there was an increase of another 1 000  Ms  Collins said  with many seeking a way to marshal themselves for political action The original group  which Ms  Collins changed from  secret  to  closed   meaning it can be seen by the public   begot subgroups  for those who wanted to focus on philanthropy  activism  business networking and writing  Woolfers in New York City began meeting in person  as Ms  Collins led field trips to Toys in Babeland  the sex accessories emporium on the Lower East Side  and hosted Scrabble tournaments and clothing swaps Woolfers have also swapped houses and apartments  rented each other rooms and raised money for groups including the Center for Reproductive Rights and the Trust for Public Land  Recently  four Woolfers spent a day at the Wallkill Correctional Facility  joining a mentorship program for inmates there There are now more than 7 600 Woolfers across the country  from New York City  Boston  San Francisco and Los Angeles  as you might expect  but also from Arkansas  Chicago and Maine  And Ms  Collins  who spent a few weeks last month on a cross country road trip with a new boyfriend meeting Woolfers in Memphis and Telluride  Colo   among other spots  has a new book  out in April  called  What Would Virginia Woolf Do  And Other Questions I Ask Myself as I Attempt to Age Without Apology   It is a sometimes wince inducing primer on fashion  sex  marriage  divorce  money and health gleaned from her experience as Woolfer in chief  and with contributions from her Woolfer sisters It also has memoirish elements  Ms  Collins details her adventures in the orgy tent at Burning Man  she and her ex brought their own sheets  and kept to themselves   her struggles with depression and her adherence to an expensive beauty routine that involves fake eyelashes and Botox  She also cops to divorce envy  and notes the benefits of prenups  long term care insurance and pharmaceuticals like Xanax  In its breezy candor  the book is as appealing and appalling as the conversations of the Woolfers online  though it lacks the tartness and invective that occasionally erupts there  turning a you go girl group of self affirmers into an unruly scrum Because when thousands of women get together on social media  what could possibly go wrong  We do fight sometimes   Ms  Collins said   We re talking about super candid things  and people have strong opinions  If you re talking about whether or not to let your 16 year old have sex or whether to have an affair or how to tell your colleague at work that she s a jerk  people will have strong responses  When one long married woman wrote about the heartache she was feeling because her lover of five years had broken up with her  many Woolfers were upset by her adultery  Ms  Collins said  and she had to step in to remove comments that were aggressive  moralistic and vitriolic  When a white Woolfer reported that a black man in a park had exposed himself to her  many in the group were inflamed that she had noted his race At first  Ms  Collins read every post herself  to steer the conversation and defuse tension  But when the group swelled to 3 000  she asked some of the early Woolfers to help her moderate  now  about 20 women have oversight of what s posted  Politics  race and infidelity are topics that reliably lead to problems   I ll be out somewhere and I ll get a text from someone saying basically there s a huge fight in Aisle 6 and what do we do   Ms  Collins said Early last year  Ms  Collins chastised the group for what she saw as occasional reflexive pettiness   This is not a liberal arts college  circa 2016   she wrote in part   We don t have to give trigger warnings  Bring on the posts about money concerns and racism concerns and class struggle  but don t blame fellow members without real cause  Assume goodness  please  Jenny Douglas  an early Woolfer and moderator  said   If there s a post you don t like  we say   Scroll on by   You don t need to pick a fight with everything or anyone you disagree with  When we are meeting online and tackling subjects that are so nuanced  you can lose that nuance  Those tender subjects are tricky to tackle in any form  Just a few weeks ago  a moderator quit the group after a discussion of moderator practices   how they vetted posts  for example   left her feeling bullied  she said There are over posters  and drunk posters  there are angry  cursing posters   whose words are promptly removed  Ms  Collins said   and posters who are a tad self righteous  And there are the lurkers and the hate readers  along with those who are repelled or bored or disappointed by the particular window into women s lives that the group affords them  I always think that Virginia Woolf would be mortified at having her name associated with this group   said Daphne Merkin  the memoirist and cultural critic  who is a member of the group but does not post anything   At first I thought it was going to be some kind of literary meeting of the minds  That there would be some interesting comments about Jean Rhys  Instead it s   What do you do with your dildos   Or this sort of subclinical despair about no longer having a flat stomach  It s not like that stuff is beneath me   Ms  Merkin went on   I mean  I once wrote a story on buffing up the vagina  but these revelations are very cosmeticized  There s little wit  but maybe wit takes more time than social media allows  This is more like the stuff you tell your girlfriend at the end of the day  the eye glazing end of intimacy  There s intimacy that s thrilling  but this isn t  Conversations have leaked outside the group  like the time one woman wrote of her son s bad behavior  and another Woolfer told her own child  who happened to know the son  who then told the son of his mother s revelations about his conduct  It was pretty easy to figure out who it was   Ms  Collins said of the offending member   I reached out and said   This is super uncool   and we removed her from the group  The way we dealt with it was to write about it  so everyone knew what had happened  Ironically  and because I m a bigger personality  I ve probably suffered more than others for this  Ms  Collins is indeed not only confessional  but also confrontational  In 2013  in an article for Elle magazine  she wrote about being arrested three times  for assaulting her first husband  for assaulting his girlfriend and for violating an order of protection he had taken out against her  by overturning a coffee table  A recent Page Six item reported that her second husband had broken her nose during a fight last September  What does it mean to be  too much   as a woman   she said   We talk about this a lot in the group  Ms  Collins is happy to share her labial regimen  see  coconut oil   above   the minutiae of her sex life and the unraveling of her second marriage  which ended in part because of the meddling of a Woolfer  as it happens  The marriage was strained  and I had been wanting a second dog for a while   Ms  Collins said   My husband didn t  but like most women I do most of the work around the house and pay my fair share   She asked the Woolfers  in essence   Am I a jerk if I just go ahead and get the dog   I thought it would be a throwaway thread   she said   But suddenly there were like 600 comments   evenly divided in opinion   She didn t get the dog  It turns out that one Woolfer who read the thread was an old friend of Ms  Collins s husband  and the woman told him about his wife s query   He came home pretty angry  and the marriage ended pretty much the next day   Ms  Collins said A revenue model for the Woolfers has yet to emerge  though Ms  Collins is working on it  She has built a website to promote her book  created a newsletter and recorded five sample podcasts   called  Raging Gracefully    which she plans to release in April  As Ms  Collins has told the group  she received a  75 000 book advance  which she split with an editor and researcher who worked with her  She is as candid about her entrepreneurial behaviors and aspirations as she is about more intimate matters  Can we create a digital platform for women over 40   Ms  Collins said  Fortunes have been lost on the print version of such endeavors  despite economic data that shows the purchasing power of this demographic  decade after decade  And Ms  Collins is not alone in trying to reach them online  Girls of a Certain Age  a six year old style site created by Kim France  the founding editor of Lucky magazine  gets about 30 000 unique hits a month and makes over six figures  Ms  France said Lesley Jane Seymour  the editor in chief of More magazine  which folded in 2016 after publishing for 19 years and was reintroduced as an online magazine for millennial women  has spent the last two years working on Covey Club   an online club for women 40  who want to continue learning  growing and expanding their world by making new friends and deeper connections   which went live this past Valentine s Day Ms  Seymour was promoting the site at the South by Southwest festival a few weeks ago  joining the stage with Tausha Robertson  creator of Ms  X  Factor  a digital space for Gen X women of color   I know there s a business here   Ms  Seymour said   The question is how to do it  We can t just sell content online  it has to be something else  What is clear is that women who are a little bit older feel disenfranchised  They feel no one is listening to them  and they feel invisible  Ms  Collins said of her group   I see it as incredible content potential and  though this sounds a little grandiose  possibly culture shifting  These women are powerful  and they have made me feel more powerful  There s a continuing conversation about whether the group is getting too big and how or if to control for privacy  When the news of Facebook s breaches broke last week  the moderators again discussed restricting new members or moving to a different platform   Maybe one day we ll have an app or some other platform for more intimacy   Ms  Collins said   But for now  here we are  basically addicted and not budging  Dina Seiden is a Brooklyn based writer and performance artist  a committed Woolfer and  now  a moderator  The group s foibles  she said  are part of the draw   They make aging so much fun  We re not all saints   no  we re perfectly human  and that is ultimately good for the group  too  Last Christmas she participated in a Secret Santa gift exchange  In a  cheeky nod   she said  to a topic the group seems to hold dear  Ms  Seiden sent her recipient a vintage vibrator  a formidable  Machine Age relic called the Vitilator she d bought on eBay for  15  the price cap the group had set   I mean  kismet   Ms  Seiden said  truly delighted by her find Unfortunately  the recipient was a germophobe  and was horrified to have received such an intimate  secondhand device  as she explained  Did Ms  Seiden want it back  If so  she d leave it with her doorman  But it was a schlep and I just wanted to put the incident behind me  so I never did pick it up   Ms  Seiden said   My dream is that the doorman gave it to a woman in his life  or that a slightly awkward exchange ensued in which the doorman had to return the vibrator to its recipient  passing it clumsily to her and in my dream  by the time she gets up to her apartment  she can t resist  transcends her putative germophobia  and gets herself off like a rock star  
Updated  8 18 a m Good morning on this rainy Tuesday In a corner of Queens  the subway cars smell of lavender Walls are wiped of graffiti and grime  Poles are de boogered  Seats are left sparkling Welcome to the New York City Transit Corona Maintenance Facility  where subway cars come to be deep cleaned  You see that shine coming through   asked Corey Skinner  a cleaner  on a recent morning while scrubbing rust off the doors of a 7 train   We call that bright work  We take a lot of pride in that  I recently traveled to the transit depot to answer a question that has been on my mind since my very first subway ride  How does the M T A  clean the subway cars The process  I found out  demands tenacity  a full body suit and gallons upon gallons of Fabuloso Unlike the subway tracks  which are cleaned with giant battery powered vacuums  or the platforms  which are occasionally power washed  subway car interiors are cleaned by hand Mr  Skinner  47  walked us through the steps  We watched as he wiped windows  scraped gum  erased graffiti and cleaned dancers  footprints off the ceiling   with care and special tools  The doors are like wood   he said as he carefully polished them with a Doodlebug scrub brush and a Chicopee wipe   You got to get into the grain of the door  so it pulls up all the rust and corrosion  Our eyes began to water  That s the bleach   he said  Or perhaps at fault was the deodorizer  the steel cleanser or a Genie Wipe  used to erase graffiti and powerful enough to  peel the skin off your fingertips   Mr  Skinner said The cocktail of chemicals is needed to rid the cars of the residue of thousands of commuters and kill some of the more than 1 688 micro organisms   most of them harmless   that a recent study found germinating in the subway This top to bottom scrub happens every two and a half months or so  during the car s regularly scheduled maintenance  at one of 13 facilities around the city Once a month  the trains are washed and scrubbed on the outside We can attest that the work drastically improves the subway cars  appearance  which has slightly declined over all during the last year  according to the M T A  s data Maybe it was the cleaning fumes  but the freshly polished seats looked particularly inviting  We even grabbed a polished pole  without worry  for the first time It takes three and a half hours for a cleaner  working alone  to get a subway car this clean  Mr  Skinner told us It s solitary work  done overnight  he said  and it can sometimes feel like a Sisyphean task  I take the 7 train to work  so a lot of times I see what I m about to get   he said The train he was polishing was almost ready  Before it returned to the city s greasy tangle of tracks  he took a moment to walk us though the cars and admire his handiwork  I love that smell   he said Here s what else is happening You ll also be getting a wash  on again off again showers are on tap today Today s high  45 The rain continues through tomorrow

IXTEPEC  Mexico EDINBURG  Texas    In some of the Mexican towns playing host to a  caravan  of more than 1 200 Central American migrants heading to the U S  border  the welcome mat has been rolled out despite President Donald Trump s call for Mexican authorities to stop them Local officials have offered lodging in town squares and empty warehouses or arranged transport for the migrants  participants in a journey organized by the immigrant advocacy group Pueblo Sin Fronteras  The officials have conscripted buses  cars  ambulances and police trucks  But the help may not be entirely altruistic  The authorities want us to leave their cities   said Rodrigo Abeja  an organizer from Pueblo Sin Fronteras   They ve been helping us  in part to speed the massive group out of their jurisdictions  At some point this spring  the caravan s 2 000 mile  3 200 km  journey that began at Tapachula near the Guatemalan border on March 25 will end at the U S  border  where some of its members will apply for asylum  while others will attempt to sneak into the United States Abeja said there was a lot of pressure from authorities to stop the caravan  because of Donald Trump s reaction   The Mexican government issued a statement late on Monday saying it was committed to  legal and orderly  migration The government said the caravan had been taking place since 2010 and was largely made up of Central Americans entering Mexico who had not met the necessary legal requirements  For this reason  participants in this  caravan  are subject to an administrative migratory procedure  while 400 have already been repatriated to their countries of origin  in strict accordance with the law and respecting their human rights   it said Those without permission to stay in Mexico or who had failed to request it through the proper channels could expect to be returned to their homelands  a government official said  speaking on condition of anonymity  DOING LITTLE Trump railed on Twitter against the caravan on Monday  accusing Mexico of  doing very little  if not NOTHING  to stop the flow of immigrants crossing the U S  border illegally   They must stop the big drug and people flows  or I will stop their cash cow  NAFTA   he concluded Mexico s interior minister Alfonso Navarrete did not directly address the caravan  but he wrote on Twitter that he spoke to the U S  Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen on Monday  and that the two had  agreed to analyze the best ways to attend to the flows of migrants in accordance with the laws of each country  Mexico must walk a delicate line with the United States because the countries are in the midst of renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement  NAFTA  along with Canada At the same time  Mexican left wing presidential candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has an 18 point lead ahead of the July 1 election  according to a poll published on Monday A Lopez Obrador victory could usher in a Mexican government less accommodating toward the United States on both trade and immigration issues Mexican Senator Angelica de la Pena  who presides over the Senate s human rights commission  told Reuters that Mexico should protect migrants  rights despite the pressure from Trump   Former President Vicente Fox called for Mexican officials to take a stand against Trump s attacks  Trump keeps  blackmailing  offending and denigrating Mexico and Mexicans   he wrote on Twitter on Monday Under Mexican law  Central Americans who enter Mexico legally are generally allowed to move freely through the country  even if their goal is to cross illegally into the United States  WE RE SUFFERING Migrants in the caravan cite a variety of reasons for joining it  Its members are disproportionately from Honduras  which has high levels of violence and has been rocked by political upheaval in recent months following the re election of U S  backed president  Juan Orlando Hernández  in an intensely disputed election Maria Elena Colindres Ortega  a member of the caravan and  until January  a member of Congress in Honduras  said she is fleeing the political upheaval at home   We ve had to live through a fraudulent electoral process   she said   We re suffering a progressive militarization and lack of institutions  and     they re criminalizing those who protested  Colindres Ortega  who opposed the ruling party in Honduras  said she spiraled into debt after serving without pay for the last 18 months of her four year term  She decided to head north after a fellow congressman from her party put out word on Facebook that a caravan of migrants was gathering in southern Mexico  leaving home with a small bag with necessities and photos of her children Pueblo Sin Fronteras has helped coordinate migrant caravans for the past several years  although previously they had a maximum of several hundred participants  During the journey members of the organization instruct the migrants about their rights  We accompany at least those who want to request asylum   said Alex Mensing  Pueblo Sin Fronteras  program director   We help prepare them for the detention process and asylum process before they cross the border  because it s so difficult for people to have success if they don t have the information  Typically  Central Americans have not fared well with U S  asylum claims  particularly those from Honduras  A Reuters analysis of immigration court data found that Hondurans who come before the court receive deportation orders in more than 83 percent of cases  the highest rate of any nationality  Hondurans also face deportation in Mexico  where immigration data shows that 5 000 Hondurans were deported from Mexico in February alone  the highest number since May 2016 Maunel Padilla  chief of the border patrol s Rio Grande Valley sector  one of the busiest crossing points on the U S  Mexico border  said in an interview with Reuters that he worries the caravan could  generate interest for other groups to do the same thing   but he was not terribly nervous about coping with the group currently traveling  Not to be flippant   Padilla said   but it s similar numbers to what we are seeing every day pretty much   Reporting by Delphine Schrank and Mica Rosenberg  Additional reporting by Dave Graham  Lizbeth Diaz  Diego Ore and Daina Beth Solomon  Editing by Sue

Good Friday  Here s what we re watching   Would a Broadcom Qualcomm deal really shift the 5G race   Mrs  May s reasonableness may not win over Europe   Has Gary Cohn reached a breaking point   The silver linings in President Trump s tariff plans   The questions BlackRock is asking gun makers Want this in your inbox every morning  Sign up here Lawmakers have pressed the government panel that scrutinizes deals for national security concerns   known as Cfius   to take a close look at Broadcom s hostile bid for its fellow chip maker  which includes a proxy fight to gain a majority of Qualcomm s board seats   The shareholder vote is scheduled for Tuesday  Most notable among them is Senator John Cornyn of Texas  the No  2 Republican  whose letter to Cfius raises two issues   Whether foreign companies like Singapore s Broadcom can gain control of American counterparts through proxy fights  Concern that Broadcom would sell off parts of Qualcomm to win regulatory approval  disrupting the work of the main American developer of 5G wireless technology   and therefore ceding the race for a superfast internet to ChinaThe WSJ recently reported that members of Cfius have been examining the former point  It s an interesting issue since the panel generally doesn t get involved until a potential transaction has been submitted to it for review  and obviously  there s nothing of the sort yet  Some officials pointed out that the panel has the jurisdiction to consider board takeovers as a form of foreign acquisition  though the article said that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin isn t sold yet on the argument But let s consider the second point  The WSJ reported that some Cfius members share Mr  Cornyn s concerns about a weakened or distracted Qualcomm falling behind Huawei of China in the 5G contest But that ignores Qualcomm s very public collaboration with Chinese tech companies on 5G  The American chip maker said in January that it has shared information on some of its hardware with Lenovo  Xiaomi and other Chinese companies And last week  Qualcomm and Huawei announced that they have jointly conducted significant tests for a 5G standard  Here s what Serge Wilenegger  a Qualcomm Wireless executive  said in the news release The research analyst Stacy Rasgon of Bernstein isn t convinced by Mr  Cornyn s point either  arguing in an investor note that Intel can also play a role in developing 5G tech and that  more importantly  Broadcom itself is very interested in the wireless standard Broadcom has a reputation for being a cost cutter  which Qualcomm has argued would likely stunt its ability to keep innovating  That question hasn t been settled  But the question of whether a deal would endanger the U S  s role in the 5G race appears to go a bit too far A related consideration  Cfius s ability to review Broadcom s moves depends on that chip maker being considered a foreign company  But shareholders of the manufacturer are scheduled to vote on moving its legal residence to the U S  from Singapore on May 6  It s unclear whether the panel will act before then   or if it would ultimately have to decide that it has no jurisdiction after that change in address   Michael de la MercedPresident Donald Trump s trade tariffs are unlikely to amount to effective policymaking  They target stanch allies and ignore far greater problems in the world trading system  But there may something to salvage from the wreckage First  on the face of it  the president seems willing to risk a stock market plunge to pursue a policy that Wall Street opposes  Too often  the disfavor of investors is taken as evidence that a policy is terrible when it might be just inconvenient to powerful interests Second  Mr  Trump s tariffs have kept an important debate over trade going  One hope for Mr  Trump s administration is that its skepticism toward free trade leads to policies that help workers whose jobs are vulnerable to free trade  The proposed tariffs on steel and aluminum are unlikely to provide longer term assistance to workers in those industries  Still  the skepticism toward free trade may now be permanent and provide future administrations with greater leeway to address its drawbacks   Peter EavisBritain s Prime Minister Theresa May on Friday described the highly preferential relationship her government is seeking to establish with the European Union after it leaves the bloc next year And to win over skeptics  she attempted to make Britain s goals seem as reasonable as possible  Her requests for a unique relationship will no doubt get short shrift from those who say Britain cannot be allowed to enjoy the benefits of trading with Europe without accepting most of the obligations  Mrs  May s response is that both sides can benefit under a new arrangement  She said And Mrs  May said Britain would not  as some fear  reduce regulation to win business from the European Union and still expect a high degree of access to the bloc s markets  She said The big questions Will the European Union be willing to set up a whole new regulatory infrastructure to oversee a stand alone trading arrangement with Britain  Why would the bloc go to such lengths when it has the clout to insist that Britain abides by its rules What would Britain do if the European Union says no to most of what s in Mrs  May s speech  It would almost certainly deepen tensions within the British government between those who want a deeply entwined trading relationship with Europe and those who favor a looser one  Mrs  May  who has spent weeks trying to build a consensus in her cabinet  may then find it even harder to present a coherent position to the European Union  giving it even less reason to want to compromise   Peter EavisPresident Trump s national economic adviser has threatened to quit before  most notably in the wake of the controversy over the violence in Charlottesville  Va  But now that Mr  Cohn apparently has been outplayed in the battle over trade  will he finally decide to depart The former Goldman Sachs president had managed to hold off trade hard liners like the policy adviser Peter Navarro and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross during previous debates on tariffs  But an exodus of like minded White House officials diminished Mr  Cohn s standing   and let his rivals reassert their positions From Damian Paletta and Josh Dawsey of the WaPo Or as Mike Allen and Jonathan Swan of Axios put it Our colleagues Mark Landler and Maggie Haberman have reported that Mr  Cohn threatened to resign if the president followed through on the tariff threat   That cost him standing with Mr  Trump  though he seemed to regain much of his political capital  particularly after the passage of the tax overhaul  Mr  Landler and Ms  Haberman point out that Mr  Cohn is still waiting to see if Mr  Trump actually rolls out the tariffs   a fair question  given how quickly his boss appears to switch policy positions But if the White House does impose tariffs on imported aluminum and steel  will Mr  Cohn finally pull the trigger On a related note  let s talk about the resuscitation of Mr  Ross s political fortunes   Axios  on Jan  21   President Donald Trump has put Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross out to pasture   the publication reported  noting that Mr  Ross had been criticized for falling asleep in meetings   Axios  today   White House staff  most of whom were in the dark about Trump s planned tariffs announcement  are referring to Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross  the victor in the policy coup  as  Chief Ross     Michael de la MercedExpect today to be rough in the markets  after President Trump doubled down this morning on his threat to impose tariffs on international steel and aluminum  S    P  500 futures are down in premarket trading  after falling yesterday The current plan  A 25 percent tariff on steel and a 10 percent one on aluminum The winners  U S  sellers of industrial metals  like AK Steel and U S  Steel  whose stocks jumped yesterday  trade hard liners like Wilbur Ross  the commerce secretary  Robert Lighthizer  the White House s top trade negotiator  and Peter Navarro  its trade policy guru The losers  Big metal consumers like Ford  G M   Boeing and United Technologies  free trade proponents like Gary Cohn  who has threatened to resign  many Republican lawmakers  Brazil  and Canada The world s response  China could retaliate with tariffs on some U S  goods  The E U  could  too  Japan and Korea are hoping that  as allies  they would be exempted   but they appear prepared to fight back The context  George W  Bush imposed tariffs on imported steel in 2002  He lifted them a year later Peter Eavis s take  Mr  Trump s tariffs may be quite narrow in focus and exist for a relatively short period  Investors could learn to live with those  But the U S  economy and stock markets have some vulnerabilities that could magnify the damage from a trade war Goldman Sachs s economists wrote that while the potential tariff s on imported steel and aluminum  could alleviate political pressure on the White House to pursue other trade restrictions in the near term   it would increase  the probability of trade restrictive outcomes to other pending issues  On Nafta On China s practices regarding intellectual property and technology transfer The Commerce Secretary appeared on CNBC and downplayed the impact of President Trump s planned tariffs  using a can of Campbell Soup Not everyone agrees with that view BlackRock  the largest investor in the world  is doubling down on pushing gun makers to consider their responsibilities to the public  BlackRock said that in the wake of the Parkland  Fla   shootings it has been speaking with public gun manufacturers and retailers Blackrock said it is asking companies to answer questions like    What is your strategy and process for managing the reputational  financial and litigation risk associated with manufacturing civilian firearms     How do you assess the financial  reputational and litigation risk of the various aspects of your product lines and how each of those products is distributed    Andrew Ross SorkinAn article in The Intercept says that not only did the real estate firm   which Jared Kushner led until joining the White House   try to convince Qatar to invest in its embattled 666 Fifth Avenue property in Manhattan  but that it spoke directly with the emirate s top money man The meeting between Charles Kushner  Mr  Kushner s father  and Ali Sharif Al Emadi of Qatar was last April  a month before Saudi Arabia and others set up a blockade of the emirate  Mr  Kushner supported the move  while Secretary of State Rex Tillerson did not More from Clayton Swisher and Ryan Grim of The Intercept A Kushner Companies spokeswoman said that the company doesn t  do business with any sovereign funds  The context  Mr  Kushner s family business has appeared to become more of a liability to his work in the White House  Remember that he held meetings with top financiers whose firms later lent money to Kushner Companies  which has aroused concerns  Or that several countries have reportedly discussed using his complicated financial ties as negotiating leverage over him   Michael de la MercedMr  Trump has long thrived on chaos as an organizing principle  But how much disorder is too much Remember that the White House has suffered from  very public infighting  off the cuff policy proposals by the president  a historically high 34 percent turnover rate  officials threatening to quit to win policy arguments  and an array of investigations into advisers  including Mr  Trump s daughter Ivanka  and cabinet members Jim Stewart spoke with a number of

on his leadership    Charles Elson of the University of Delaware said   He isn t bound by any traditional norms of management  Here s what the Federal Reserve chairman told the Senate Banking Committee   Nothing is suggesting to me that wage inflation is at a point of accelerating  I would expect that some continued strengthening in the labor market can take place without causing inflation

Updated  10 30 a m Good morning on this Holy Thursday It s opening day for Major League Baseball  and our two teams have two new faces that will be hard to miss this season Their managers Mickey Callaway has taken over for the Mets  and Aaron Boone will lead the Yankees  The manager is the most public face of every single team  more so than the players   said James Wagner  who covers the Mets for The Times  Both teams had managers for a long time   he added   Terry Collins had been with the Mets for seven years  and Joe Girardi with the Yankees for 10    so there s been continuity for both teams that changed at the same time  It will be a gamble for both squads because neither manager has done the job before  Mr  Callaway was the pitching coach of the Cleveland Indians  and Mr  Boone was an ESPN announcer with no coaching or managing experience They are also younger than most managers  At 68  Mr  Collins  was the oldest manager in the major leagues  Mr  Callaway  42  is one of the youngest  It s become a trend to have younger  more inexperienced people be managers   Mr  Wagner said   Knowing how to handle data and information and knowing how to relate to the players is more important than having done this for 30 years  And Mr  Boone  45  is nearly a decade younger than Mr  Girardi  He was very hard nosed and didn t have much of a sense of humor   Billy Witz  who covers the Yankees for The Times  said of the team s former manager   and I think his communication skills were drawn into question   They got somebody who was that antithesis of that in Aaron Boone   he s very engaging and his strengths are in some of the areas that Girardi was lacking  so it ll be interesting to see how much his lack of experience is a factor   Mr  Witz said The Mets host the St

It isn t going too far out on a limb to predict that  Ready Player One  will turn out to be one of Steven Spielberg s more controversial projects  Even before its release  this adaptation of Ernest Cline s 2011 best seller   what one writer called a   nerdgasm  of a novel   was subjected to an unusual degree of internet pre hate  That was only to be expected  Mr  Spielberg has tackled contentious topics before   terrorism  slavery  the Pentagon Papers  sharks   but nothing as likely to stir up a hornet s nest of defensiveness  disdain and indignant  actually  ing as the subject of this movie  which is video games And not only video games   Ready Player One   written by Mr  Cline and Zak Penn  dives into the magma of fan zeal  male self pity and techno mythology in which those once innocent pastimes are now embedded  Mr  Spielberg  a digital enthusiast and an old school cineaste  goes further than most filmmakers in exploring the aesthetic possibilities of a form that is frequently dismissed and misunderstood Aided by his usual cinematographer  Janusz Kaminski  and by the production designer Adam Stockhausen  he turns a vast virtual landscape of battling avatars into a bustling pop cultural theme park  an interactive museum of late 20th  and early 21st century entertainment  a maze of niche tastes  cultish preoccupations and blockbuster callbacks  Mr  Spielberg navigates this warehouse with his usual dexterity  loading every frame with information without losing the clarity and momentum of the story Nonetheless  the toy guns of social media and pop up kulturkritik are locked and loaded  Mr  Spielberg will be accused of taking games and their players too seriously and not seriously enough  of pandering and mocking  of just not getting it and not being able to see beyond it    it  being the voracious protoplasm that has  over the past three or four decades  swallowed up most of our cultural discourse  Whatever you call it   the revenge of the nerds  the franchising of the universe  the collapse of civilization   it s a force that is at once emancipatory and authoritarian  innocent and pathological  delightful and corrosive Mr  Spielberg and some of his friends helped to create this monster  which grants him a measure of credibility and also opens him up to a degree of suspicion  He is the only person who could have made this movie and the last person who should have been allowed near the material That material has issues of its own  Mr  Cline s book   readable and amusing without being exactly good   is a hodgepodge of cleverness and cliché  Less than a decade after publication  it already feels a bit dated  partly because its dystopian vision seems unduly optimistic and partly because its vision of male geek rebellion has turned stale and sour In the film  set in 2045  Wade Watts  a young man played by the agreeably bland  blandly agreeable Tye Sheridan  lives in  the stacks   a vertical pile of trailers where the poorer residents of Columbus  Ohio  Oklahoma City in the book   cling to hope  dignity and their VR gloves  Humanity has been ravaged by the usual political and ecological disasters  among them  bandwidth riots  referred to in Wade s introductory voice over   and most people seek refuge in a digital paradise called the Oasis That world   less a game than a Jorge Luis Borges cosmos populated by wizards  robots and racecar drivers   is the creation of James Halliday  Mark Rylance   After Halliday s death  his avatar revealed the existence of a series of Easter eggs  or secret digital treasures  the discovery of which would win a lucky player control of the Oasis  Wade is a  gunter    short for  egg hunter    determined to pursue this quest even after most of the other gamers have tired of it  Among his rivals are a few fellow believers and Nolan Sorrento  Ben Mendelsohn   the head of a company called IOI that wants to bring Halliday s paradise under corporate control In the real world  IOI encourages Oasis fans to run up debts that it collects by forcing them into indentured servitude  Sorrento s villainy sets up a battle on two fronts   clashes in the Oasis mirroring chases through the streets of Columbus   that inspires Mr  Spielberg to feats of crosscutting virtuosity  The action is so swift and engaging that some possibly literal minded questions may be brushed aside  I  for one  didn t quite understand why  given the global reach of the Oasis  all the relevant players were so conveniently clustered in Ohio   If anyone wants to explain  please find me on Twitter so I can mute you  But  of course  Columbus and the Oasis do not represent actual or virtual realities  but rather two different modalities of fantasy  Wade s avatar  Parzival  collects a posse of fighters  Sho  Daito  Aech and Art3mis  who is also his love interest  When the people attached to these identities meet up in Columbus  they are not exactly as they are in the game  Aech  large and male in the Oasis  is played by Lena Waithe  But the fluidity of online identity remains an underexploited possibility  In and out of the Oasis  Art3mis  also known as Samantha  and portrayed by Olivia Cooke  is a male fantasy of female badassery  Sho  Philip Zhao  and Daito  Win Morisaki  are relegated to sidekick duty  The multiplayer  self inventing ethos of gaming might have offered a chance for a less conventional division of heroic labor  but the writers and filmmakers lacked the imagination to take advantage of it The most fun part of  Ready Player One  is its exuberant and generous handing out of pop cultural goodies  Tribute is paid to Mr  Spielberg s departed colleagues John Hughes and Stanley Kubrick  The visual and musical allusions are eclectic enough that nobody is likely to feel left out  and everybody is likely to feel a little lost from time to time Nostalgia  Sure  but what really animates the movie is a sense of history  The Easter egg hunt takes Parzival and his crew back into Halliday s biography   his ill starred partnership with Ogden Morrow  Simon Pegg   his thwarted attempts at romance   and also through the evolution of video games and related pursuits  The history is instructive and also sentimental in familiar ways  positing a struggle for control between idealistic  artistic entrepreneurs  and their legions of fans  and soulless corporate greedheads Halliday is a sweet  shaggy nerd with a guileless Northern California drawl and a deeply awkward manner  especially around women  Sorrento is an autocratic bean counter  a would be master of the universe who doesn t even like video games  These characters are clichés  but they are also allegorical figures In the movie  they represent opposing principles  but in our world  they are pretty much the same guy  A lot of the starry eyed do it yourselfers tinkering in their garages and giving life to their boyish dreams back in the  70s and  80s turned out to be harboring superman fantasies of global domination all along  They shared their wondrous creations and played the rest of us for suckers  collecting our admiration  our attention and our data as profit and feudal tribute Mr  Spielberg incarnates this duality as perfectly as any man alive  He is the peer of Steve Jobs and Bill Gates  and a Gandalf for the elves and hobbits who made Google  Facebook and the other components of our present day Oasis  He has been man child and mogul  wide eyed artist and cold eyed businessman  praised for making so many wonderful things and blamed for ruining everything  His career has been a splendid enactment of the cultural contradictions of capitalism  and at the same time a series of deeply personal meditations on love  loss and imagination  All of that is also true of Halliday s Oasis   Ready Player One  is far from a masterpiece  but as the fanboys say  it s canon 
Good Wednesday  Here s what we re watching   Theranos shows private companies can be held to account t oo  Was Bear a bad deal for JPMorgan   The failed Qualcomm bid portends a new front in potential global trade wars   How Boeing has the most to lose from the metals tariffs   Bear Stearns was a decade ago  Could it happen again   And R I P  Stephen Hawking Get this in your inbox each morning  Sign up here The Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday charged Elizabeth Holmes  the founder of Theranos  with fraud for raising money from investors on the back of false claims about the company s blood testing technology  One of Theranos s main products  called a miniLab  could not perform all the tests the company said it could  the commission asserted  That  according to the complaint  didn t stop Theranos from claiming that it had a bright future ahead Here are some of the things the commission says Theranos  a private company  did to pull the wool over investors  eyes It allegedly performed tests on non Theranos equipment without telling representatives of a pharmacy company that was poised to invest money in the company Theranos allegedly distributed fake reports by pharmaceutical companies Theranos allegedly made misleading statements about its work with the United States Department of Defense Ms  Holmes allegedly told an investor Theranos expected to expand quickly in the stores of a pharmacy chain  but the likelihood of such an expansion was small The Food and Drug Administration communicated to Theranos that its approval would be needed  but Ms  Holmes allegedly told investors afterward that F D A  approval was merely voluntary Ms  Holmes allegedly gave investors fake financial results   Peter EavisThere is an old adage that if it sounds too good to be true  it isn t  The case filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission against Theranos and Elizabeth Holmes describes a litany of falsehoods about a claimed revolutionary method to conduct blood tests that turned out to be pure fiction Ms  Holmes and the company settled the case  although the former president  Ramesh  Sunny  Balwani  is fighting the charges  She will pay a  500 000 penalty  return her shares in Theranos  and agreed to a ban on serving as an officer or director of a public company for 10 years What makes this case interesting is that Theranos was one of the original unicorns  a private company with a value of more than  1 billion  We usually see the S E C  pursue charges against public companies and their executives  while private firms operate largely free from scrutiny   at least until they prepare for an I P O The antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws  however  apply to any transaction in a security in which there is a misstatement of material fact  Thus  when Theranos raised millions of dollars by selling shares to hedge funds and venture capitalists  the false claims about the viability of its blood testing labs ended up being a scheme to defraud For Ms  Holmes  the settlement means that she will be cut off from raising money for any new venture for a long time  The complaint shows a systemic effort to deceive investors over a number of years  no doubt in a desperate hope that somehow the technology could be made to work  It is unlikely anyone in Silicon Valley or on Wall Street will trust her again   Peter J  HenningMr  Kudlow  in an interview with The Wall Street Journal  said that Mr  Trump offered him the job as director of the National Economic Council and that he immediately accepted  Mr  Kudlow told The Journal that an announcement could come as early as Thursday ReactionMark Hamrick  Bankrate com s senior economic analyst Ten year s ago almost to the day  JPMorgan Chase acquired Bear Stearns  a troubled investment bank  for what looked like a steal  But Jamie Dimon  JPMorgan s C E O   has since said he wouldn t do a deal like it again  citing the high legal costs that came later But was buying Bear Stearns as bad a deal as Mr  Dimon suggests While we don t have all the numbers necessary for a full accounting  there is much in the public domain that can help answer this question  And this information suggests that  while the Bear Stearns acquisition probably wasn t as profitable as expected in March 2008  JPMorgan may still have benefited from it   even after taking into account the legal expenses What caused the legal costs and how big were they  The payouts were made mostly to settle allegations that Wall Street firms had stuffed loans into mortgage backed bonds that did not meet agreed upon standards  How big were those costs  In his 2015 letter to shareholders  Mr  Dimon said that some 70 percent of JPMorgan s nearly  19 billion in mortgage related legal costs were related to Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual  the thrift JPMorgan also bought during the crisis  For the sake of argument  let s assume that 35 percent of that  19 billion stemmed from Bear Stearns  mortgages  The cost to JPMorgan then would be around  6 7 billion That s a lot  but when JPMorgan did the deal  it agreed to terms that gave it a lot of financial protection against nasty surprises like this JPMorgan paid  1 5 billion for Bear Stearns  far below the  11 8 billion of shareholders  equity that Bear Stearns reported on its balance sheet at the end of 2007  This wide margin for error would have helped the bank absorb the  6 billion of merger related costs that executives anticipated in March 2008 True  JPMorgan almost certainly ended up marking down Bear Stearns  riskier assets by more than expected in the months after the deal  when market conditions got even worse  But many of these assets could have recovered in the next few years as the financial system stabilized  After 2008   principal transactions  at JPMorgan s investment bank  the business line that included the performance of many of Bear Stearns  assets  produced over  8 billion of annual revenue  far more than the  4 4 billion that JPMorgan on its own generated in 2007 Let s also not forget that the Federal Reserve took a large slug of the risk in the deal  The Fed made an extraordinary loan to a special entity that bought some  30 billion of Bear Stearns  assets  According to Kate Kelly s book on Bear Stearns  final days  JPMorgan was reluctant to buy Bear Stearns without assistance from the Fed  JPMorgan did provide a  1 2 billion loan to the Fed s entity  in theory exposing it to some losses on the assets  But in the end  that loan generated a  665 million gain for JPMorgan in 2012 The Bear Stearns deal also came with some straightforward positives  JPMorgan  for instance  got Bear Stearns  leading prime brokerage unit  a business that provided brokerage services to hedge funds  That and other Bear Stearns operations were expected to add at least  1 billion a year to JPMorgan earnings  the bank s executives said at the time And  of course  JPMorgan scooped up Bear Stearns  trophy tower in Midtown Manhattan  At the time of the deal  the building  at 383 Madison Ave   had an estimated value of  1 2 billion  According to the estimates of developers in the New York real estate market  the building is now worth at least  1 8 billion    Peter Eavis with reporting from Charles V  Bagli Jun Ying  the former chief information officer of Equifax s core United States

A cold war is being waged across the world s most advanced industries  And it just got a lot chillier Recent tit for tat trade actions could deepen what has become a global contest for technological dominance between the United States and China  home to the planet s largest population of internet users and a flourishing community of start ups and innovative companies The Trump administration this week accused Beijing of stealing valuable technological know how from American companies as it proposed tariffs on  60 billion in Chinese goods and curbs on Chinese investments  China responded with its own set of penalties aimed at American products The fight between the two countries is cleaving the high tech realm  The world s two biggest economies have each become increasingly protective of their own leading edge industries  and mistrustful of the other s  Reconciliation looks difficult  And the rising tensions could further undercut American influence in a huge and fast changing market Both sides have been putting up defensive walls for years To stay in business in China  Apple has had to set up a data center there to store Chinese customers  personal information  Amazon recently had to sell equipment to its Chinese cloud services partner to comply with new Chinese rules  Facebook and Twitter are blocked in the country  newer American players  such as Snap  are not even trying to enter anymore In the United States  regulators have repeatedly thwarted attempts by Chinese tech groups to acquire American firms  And espionage concerns have for years kept Huawei   one of the world s biggest suppliers of telecom gear  and a powerhouse of China s tech scene   largely out of the American market The Trump administration says it wants to level the playing field  dishing out to Chinese companies the kind of treatment that American ones have been receiving in China for some time  China s abilities and ambitions have shifted much further up the value added chain  to tech that represents our crown jewels economically and that is relevant for national security   said Scott Kennedy  a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington   So there s no way to kick this can down the road anymore  Still  as much as American companies complain about how they are treated in China  it could get even worse if Beijing amplifies its retaliation beyond the tariffs  announced Friday  on  3 billion worth of goods China could require that foreign tech companies undergo costly additional tests for new products  or simply make it more difficult to operate in the country  Apple  whose iPhones remain coveted among well off Chinese  made nearly  18 billion in the country in the last quarter of 2017  Qualcomm  the San Diego microchip maker  has earned half its revenue in China in recent years It could also devise new regulatory hoops for foreign companies to jump through  China s Ministry of Commerce has not yet approved Qualcomm s proposed   44 billion purchase of NXP Semiconductors  a Dutch chip maker  The deal  more than a year in the making  needs a signoff from Chinese antitrust authorities because the two companies count a large number of electronics makers in China as customers Both countries  efforts to kneecap each other s tech champions are as much about national security as economic might  Likewise with the race to dominate frontier fields such as artificial intelligence  quantum computing and next generation wireless internet  Mr  Trump recently blocked a hostile bid by Broadcom to buy Qualcomm  He did so not because the bidder was Chinese   Broadcom is headquartered in Singapore   but because the administration said the deal would weaken Qualcomm  leaving Huawei with a stronger hand to shape 5G  or fifth generation mobile technology This is why the present tensions are so difficult to resolve  In a previous era  Japan was a technological rival but a military ally  The Soviet Union was a tech rival in defense  though a laggard in the commercial sphere  The U S  and China have so intertwined their science and technology systems through trade and investment and cooperative research   but see each other  and continue to see each other  as strategic competitors and adversaries   said Adam Segal  a tech and security expert at the Council on Foreign Relations   That hasn t happened before  China s angst about foreign tech dominance runs deep For most of the past decade  Beijing has blocked many American internet services  including Facebook s and Google s  to control the flow of information and head off social media fueled movements such as the Arab Spring Another great paroxysm of worry came in 2013  when Edward J  Snowden leaked documents showing ties between American technology providers and the National Security Agency s vast surveillance program For China   one of the major takeaways was   We are overly reliant on American technology over which we have very little control    said Rogier Creemers  a scholar of Chinese tech policy at Leiden University in the Netherlands A Communist Party linked newsmagazine singled out the American companies that it said had penetrated most deeply into China s information infrastructure  The  Eight Guardian Warriors   as they were called   Apple  Cisco  Google  IBM  Intel  Microsoft  Oracle and Qualcomm   had been able to  drive right into China   the article said  whereas Huawei and another Chinese equipment maker  ZTE  had been kept out of the United States Beijing swung into action  It banned government offices from installing the most recent version of Microsoft Windows  and antitrust investigators raided Microsoft s offices  Cisco  Apple and Intel products were removed from state lists that officials use as guides when buying equipment  Qualcomm got slapped with a  975 million fine for anticompetitive behavior The political pressure sent American companies scrambling to link up with Chinese partners  leading to joint ventures of the sort that the Trump administration  and some in the American business community  have decried as unfair Cisco partnered with a Chinese firm to sell networking systems  Microsoft  in conjunction with a state company closely tied to the Chinese military  developed a version of Windows more suitable for China s government  Advanced Micro Devices  Intel and Qualcomm began working with Chinese organizations in microchips  which China imports in huge quantities to put into smartphones  computers and other electronics Despite the boost from America s giants  and hefty doses of state funding  China s semiconductor push is still in its early days  But most observers believe that it is only a matter of time before Chinese factories catch up to those at industry leaders in the United States  South Korea and Taiwan  They are very conscious that they still have a long way to go   said Dieter Ernst  a senior fellow at the East West Center  a research and educational organization based in Honolulu   But they also know that in semiconductors  they are by far the most important market for American companies  One stumbling block for China  Attempts to scoop up foreign chip makers mostly have not worked out  State owned Tsinghua Unigroup tried to buy Micron Technology  a memory chip maker based in Idaho  for  23 billion in 2015  but regulatory worries scuttled the deal The Trump administration last year blocked a China backed investor from buying Lattice Semiconductor  an Oregon based manufacturer  And regulatory concerns scotched a Chinese investment group s plan to buy Xcerra  even though the Massachusetts based company makes chip testing equipment and not chips themselves In Washington  concern about the emerging rivalry with China has been reflected in a number of recent reports  from the likes of the Pentagon and the Department of Energy  that warn about the country s growing tech capabilities  Still  shorter term considerations could mean that Washington would back down before Beijing in an all out trade war  If the markets take a nose dive as we move closer to the midterm elections   Mr  Kennedy of the Center for Strategic and International Studies said   that would put some pressure on Trump to look for face saving solutions  even if final problems haven t been addressed  
WASHINGTON   The owner of Taco Bamba Taqueria peered out from the kitchen at the line of customers snaking around the corner at his latest spot in a suburban Virginia strip mall  and felt terror  Who was going to cook  serve and clean up for all these people  The cooks had left   overwhelmed by the crowds  said Victor Albisu  who owns four Taco Bambas in the region  with a new upscale Mexican place on the horizon   The wait staff had left  The chef and sous chef had walked out because of the amount of business  It doesn t stop  A tight labor market and an explosion of new restaurants have made finding and keeping help ever more difficult across the country In 2017  the National Restaurant Association reports  37 percent of its members said labor recruitment was their top challenge  up from 15 percent two years ago  With low profit margins leaving little room to do what most businesses do in tight labor markets   increase wages   restaurant owners are having to find other ways to attract and hold onto workers They are offering incentives  like repaying culinary school tuition for their chefs  They are hiring former prisoners as kitchen assistants  and snapping up employees whom competitors have fired  They are trying to retain employees with tequila tasting seminars  flexible schedules and a faster pipeline up the ranks  I think the assumption is  the industry has to continue to evolve in terms of the work force it is trying to appeal to   said Gordon Lambourne  a spokesman for the National Restaurant Association Educational Foundation   People want flexibility  they want some growth defined for them  The growth in dining out is clear  The nation added 15 145 restaurants  a net increase of 2 5 percent  just between the third quarters of 2016 and 2017  according to the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics  Everybody eats out   said Gerri Mason Hall  the head of human resources at Sodexo in North America  the giant food service company and cafeteria operator  which also vies for restaurant workers   We are competing for executive chefs  front line cooks  the entire talent pool  The demand for highly skilled help is especially acute in Washington  where a boom in restaurants run by creative chefs is outstripping the region s labor force  Zagat named Washington  once considered a second tier city in the culinary world  as the nation s hottest food city in 2016 Established players from around the country have moved in  like the chef David Chang of the New York based Momofuku group and Stephen Starr  the Philadelphia restaurateur behind the Washington hot spot Le Diplomate  Danny Meyer  the New York restaurant mogul  is on his way with an outpost of Union Square Cafe In February  the last month for which data is available  food service accounted for about a quarter of all net job growth here  a 5 percent increase over the previous year  according to the Department of Labor Restaurant industry experts say the recent crackdown on undocumented workers has sent a further chill through the business  Dishwashers and other low wage restaurant workers have long been recruited from the nation s undocumented work force  but many restaurateurs are wary now of going to that well  Our industry is very much in need of a temporary visa program for the low skilled  essential workers   said Shannon Meade  the National Restaurant Association s director of labor and work force policy  While visas are available for seasonal work  she added   a year round program would go a long way to addressing our hiring and retention issue  The labor shortage has at times altered the nature of restaurants  as well as the quality of service   In some cases I believe it has changed the direction certain restaurants had originally planned on    said Mr  Albisu  the Taco Bamba owner   There is less polish  Many diners complain about restaurants where the food is expensive but the service is lacking  Water glasses are left unfilled  Guests stand waiting for attention at a host stand  and servers with little knowledge of the menu merely smile sheepishly as sophisticated customers ask questions Lindsay DiSalvo  the assistant general manager at Metropolitan Hospitality Group  which operates several restaurants in the Washington region  recently spent one of her rare days off poring through the résumés of 15 applicants for a coming venture without finding anyone suitable   I was freaking out   she said The more experienced workers  she said  are attracted to the increasing number of Washington restaurants with high profile chefs  leaving midlevel establishments like hers struggling with inexperienced and often fickle help  One woman seeking a position at the bar  she said   could not name a single varietal of wine  Mr  Albisu said pride long ago succumbed to desperation   I can name two dozen people who left my company to start a new place who came back looking for their old jobs back   he said   In the old days we would say   Hell  no   Now we say   Sure   We chefs call each other and say   Have you fired anyone we can repurpose  I know he can t plate  but maybe he can just grill   Chris Floyd  the owner of Capital Restaurant Resources  a recruitment firm  said a central problem is that Washington does not naturally attract people interested in food   People don t come here for restaurant careers   he said   They came here to be in government or go to grad school or be lawyers  The population hasn t caught up with the demand in the hospitality industry  So chefs and restaurant owners are casting their recruitment nets more widely  What we need to start doing better than ever is breaking down the stereotypes of who typically gets these jobs   Mr  Meyer  the founder of Union Square Hospitality Group  said during a recent panel discussion in Washington   We are holding job fairs right now with organizations we were not even thinking about five years ago   he said  including those that assist people with learning disabilities  older workers and former prisoners Many Washington restaurateurs turn to D C  Central Kitchen  which trains ex prisoners  the formerly homeless and recovering addicts  In the past two years  87 percent of its 177 graduates found jobs  said Alexander Justice Moore  the organization s chief development officer Still  he said the group could do more   We can only fit so many students in our cramped classroom in the basement of a homeless shelter   he said The National Restaurant Association has begun several programs for high school students and adults who have trouble getting work  including apprenticeships through the Department of Labor and a new initiative that helps place veterans into food service Taco Bell and McDonald s both announced in recent weeks that they would expand programs to help employees pay for college tuition Chris Coombs  the chef and owner of the restaurant group Boston Urban Hospitality  has offered to repay culinary school loans   One consistent theme of our cooks is that they all had student loan debt   he said   It was one of many tactics  He even outsourced the unpleasant duty of deep cleaning the kitchen that usually fell to 20  to 30 something line cooks   I think millennials are really focused on quality of life   he said He has also tried to clean up the kitchen in other ways   You can t come to work and scream at people   he said   When I was a younger chef  that was how I interacted with my team  We have a lot more positive training methods now  Michael Schlow  who owns restaurants around the country  offers his team educational workshops on wine and spirits  and recently took two chefs on a trip to Italy to study cooking techniques and eat  We don t win them over with a paycheck   he said   Pay is important  but of more importance is respect and admiration and learning  If people feel like they are learning  they are more apt to stay  The  MeToo movement has had an impact as well  Accusations of harassment and worse against well known chefs like Mario Batali and John Besh have shed light on abusive and discriminatory practices in the industry that many owners say will have to change if restaurants want to attract workers  particularly women Restaurateurs must start  taking care of their staff   said Aaron Silverman  the owner of the celebrated Rose s Luxury  on Capitol Hill  The goal is restaurants that are as professionally run as other businesses    places that just happen to serve food  Follow NYT Food on Facebook  Instagram  Twitter and

BUENA PARK  Calif    The restaurants along Beach Boulevard  a dusty stretch in this Orange County suburb  are primarily known for their larger than life aesthetic  the immense gray fortress encasing Medieval Times  the 18th century Spanish galleon inside Pirate s Dinner Adventure  and the lanky neon guitar neck standing tall next to Rock   Brews So it s not all that remarkable that an Indian restaurant sits within a four level  sandy pink Mission style villa that used to be a Ripley s Believe It or Not  museum What is surprising is that this imposing building   its entrance presided over by a statue of Buddha left from a previous incarnation   has been chosen to house the first American restaurant from Sanjeev Kapoor  the most famous chef in India  Mr  Kapoor runs his own 24 hour food channel  hosted one of the longest running cooking shows in Asia and oversees a multimillion dollar empire complete with restaurant franchises  cookbooks and endorsement deals Even more unusual are the people Mr  Kapoor has chosen to run this place  called the Yellow Chilli  Satvinder Ghotra and Kamal Kaur  a husband and wife team who have never opened or run a restaurant The couple say they have invested all their money in the business  quit their day jobs and dream of opening Kapoor restaurants on the Las Vegas Strip and in Los Angeles International Airport Why have they taken on such an enormous risk  Simple  They re the celebrity chef s biggest fans  Sanjeev Kapoor is the No  1 chef in India   Mr  Ghotra declared   This isn t just a side business  We are 100 percent devoted  On a recent Sunday afternoon  Mr  Ghotra  46  and Ms  Kaur  45  hurried into the restaurant  which has been in soft opening mode since August and will officially open this spring  They had parked their olive Maserati Levante so it stretched over two handicapped spots Ms  Kaur  who speaks rapidly and mainly in superlatives  was talking about getting her hair colored at the salon  while Mr  Ghotra  the more subdued  data minded half of the pair  quietly organized the business cards at the host stand They ushered their two children  ages 9 and 10  into the back office  and switched the seven television screens around the restaurant to Food Food  Mr  Kapoor s 24 hour television channel  Both Ms  Kaur and Mr  Ghotra have been watching his shows for years  Everything I learned   Indian food  Indian Chinese  Indian Thai   he taught me   Ms  Kaur said  pointing to one of the TVs   It s like he s part of the family right now   Khana Khazana   Mr  Kapoor s most famous show  the title means  Food Treasure    inspired Mr  Ghotra to start cooking as a teenager  He earned a master s degree in travel and tourism at Devi Ahilya Vishwavidyalaya  a university in Indore  but after marrying Ms  Kaur and immigrating to the United States in 1998  he wound up in sales at the stone company MS International  Ms  Kaur  who received an M B A  from Savitribai Phule Pune University  was working in marketing for a TV channel called PTC Punjabi In early 2015  Ms  Kaur connected on Facebook with an old broadcasting colleague  Satyaki Mukherjee  who manages franchising for Mr  Kapoor  Mr  Mukherjee mentioned that the chef was interested in entering the American market with his midpriced  family friendly franchise  the Yellow Chilli  I started thinking about how in Southern California  when Indian professionals or family come in from India  they want to eat Indian food  but there s not a nice place to take them   Ms  Kaur recalled  Seeing the potential in opening a restaurant with Mr  Kapoor s name attached  the couple applied to become full time franchisees That November  they flew to Mumbai to meet with Mr  Kapoor and his team  The first time Ms  Kaur shook hands with the famous chef  she said   it was the same feeling I got when Michael Jackson came to Mumbai  In a recent interview  Mr  Kapoor  53  said he had been approached over the years by individuals interested in opening his restaurants in America  but most were just fans  with little sense for the realities of running a business  Being a fan is actually a negative for me  because those people think that when you sign up with me  people will come to the restaurant just because of my name   he said   When I meet with people  I paint a pretty poor picture  I ask them   When everyone else is having fun  are you O K  working even on Christmas  Holi  Diwali   Mr  Ghotra and Ms  Kaur were different  he said  They were unfazed by the challenge  Unfazed is an understatement   Mr  Kapoor said   They were mad  But we need mad people  We need that kind of passion  Opening a restaurant is a bigger commitment than getting married  I could tell what this restaurant meant to them  And they could eat well  Each of the 45 Yellow Chilli locations worldwide  including branches in Oman and Canada  is designed to look more or less the same on the inside  The Buena Park interior is stripped down and neutral toned  more contemporary and minimalist than colorful and Indian inspired  Inside the entrance is a high contrast black and white image of Mr  Kapoor The menu is dominated by hearty north Indian dishes that are signatures of Mr  Kapoor  like the rich lentil stew Lalla Mussa Dal  and Shaam Savera  spinach coated cheese dumplings submerged in a thick tomato gravy  Mr  Ghotra and Ms  Kaur hired all of the restaurant s kitchen staff themselves  and then the corporate chef for Mr  Kapoor s company  Pradipto Das  flew in to help with menu development and training But the couple have their own ideas about how best to appeal to the American market First  they re looking to target only Indian Americans  who may be more familiar with the chef   I don t want to run after any other crowd   Mr  Ghotra said   This brand is so deep in Indian minds  But for non Indians who don t know him  it will take a couple of years to cultivate that brand  Buena Park attracts hordes of tourists to attractions like Knott s Berry Farm  but the couple plan instead to appeal to the large Indian populations in nearby cities like Irvine and Artesia   If 5 000 people come once a month and spend  25  that is our break even   Ms  Kaur said The restaurant will participate in South Asian wedding expos  local festivals surrounding Indian holidays like Holi and Diwali  and events for groups of South Asian college students  For the grand opening  Ms  Kaur hopes to invite Indian Americans in the area for two days of ticketed dinners and cooking demonstrations featuring Mr  Kapoor  who will fly in for the occasion The couple are also looking into turning the restaurant s adjacent banquet hall   a sprawling space with disco balls  flashy chandeliers and shiny  pearl white wallpaper   into a club for young Indian Americans  The restaurant hosted a New Year s Eve party  the 350 tickets  priced from  100 to  125  sold out two weeks in advance They are thinking about painting the exterior white  to make it stand out more among the other flamboyant attractions in the area  To lend a more high end feel  they ve been testing a valet parking service  even though the restaurant has its own 66 car lot  People started complaining  saying   How could you have so much parking  and then I have to pay for it    Mr  Ghotra said   But we are just trying to create a certain experience  Mr  Ghotra and Ms  Kaur say they have sunk almost  1 million into the space   We sold our house and a few other possessions   Ms  Kaur said   We told the kids   Your college money is in there   In addition to overhead costs  they pay a franchise fee and monthly royalties to Mr  Kapoor s company   People said   You could open a restaurant with  200 000   why invest close to a million    Mr  Ghotra said   It s because we wanted to create a brand  Neither sees this investment as a gamble  Everybody at some point in time is connected to Sanjeev Kapoor   Ms  Kaur said   They see him on YouTube  they read the books  It s a safe bet  You don t have to educate people  A risk is when you put in a million dollars and don t get it ever  We know we will get our million  and with those intangible benefits attached  By  intangible benefits   Ms  Kaur was referring to the celebrity that she believes she and her husband have attained ever since they started associating with Mr  Kapoor  In my M B A  WhatsApp group  I am the star   she said   We just want to be recognized  We want to make enough Benjamins  but if you are not recognized  what the heck  The couple name dropped some of their most recent restaurant guests  including the mayor of Artesia  Ali Sajjad Taj  and the owner of MS International  Mr  Ghotra s former employer  Manu Shah   He is a billionaire   Mr  Ghotra said of Mr  Shah   He wanted to take a picture with us  All the big shots in the area want to shake hands with us  Ms  Kaur exclaimed   We can go down in Wikipedia as the guys who got Sanjeev Kapoor to America  While Yellow Chilli has been in soft opening mode  locals have slowly been filtering in  curious to try the restaurant when they see the Sanjeev Kapoor connection Tushar Sobti used to frequent the Yellow Chilli in Jalandhar  where he grew up  He was excited to try the Buena Park location  but ultimately felt that some of the dishes fell short   Have a spoonful of Lalla Mussa Dal in India  and have a spoon of it here  It s just different   he said   I can t explain it  It s more flavorful in India   A lot more flavorful   added another young customer  Ruchika Sinha  who had eaten at a different Yellow Chilli in India But on hearing about the grand opening event featuring Mr  Kapoor  Ms  Sinha s eyes lit up   Really  He s coming here   she asked   Maybe I ll stop by  Kamal Singh  who runs India House  a Buena Park restaurant started by his parents  said that even though there is a lot of buzz around the Yellow Chilli   what separates a franchise and a family run restaurant is personal connections  Those will always win in the long term  He said it could be difficult for the Yellow Chilli to resonate deeply in the community  because with a franchise  there is always an agenda to just make more money  Mr  Ghotra and Ms  Kaur envision turning the Yellow Chilli into an American chain    the Indian answer to Olive Garden  authentic Indian food for the middle class   Mr  Ghotra said  They would also like to open branches of Mr  Kapoor s fast casual chain  the Yellow Chilli Express  in the Los Angeles airport and local strip malls Someday  they said  they ll bring Mr  Kapoor s fine dining restaurant  Signature by Sanjeev Kapoor  to the Las Vegas Strip   I d love to open at Mandalay Bay  or the Wynn  or the Cosmopolitan   anything central and modern   Mr  Ghotra said   Maybe the Trump hotel  Ms  Kaur cut in   That s vetoed  The two think frequently about what they will do when they make their first million from the restaurant  They ll finally take down that Buddha statue  they re too superstitious to do so right now   buy an expensive house in the Hollywood Hills and open a Hard Rock Cafe style restaurant for Bollywood movies  It s all thanks to God   Ms  Kaur said  before quickly

Madison Square Garden has quietly used facial recognition technology to bolster security and identify those entering the building  according to multiple people familiar with the arena s security procedures The technology uses cameras to capture images of people  and then an algorithm compares the images to a database of photographs to help identify the person and  when used for security purposes  to determine if the person is considered a problem  The technology  which is sometimes used for marketing and promotions  has raised concerns over personal privacy and the security of any data that is stored by the system  MSG continues to test and explore the use of new technologies to ensure we re employing the most effective security procedures to provide a safe and wonderful experience for our guests   the Garden said in a statement A spokeswoman for the Garden declined to answer questions about the use of face scanning technology It is unclear when the face scanning system was installed  The people familiar with the Garden s use of the technology  who were granted anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about it  said they did not know how many events at the Garden in recent months have used it or how the data has been handled  In a lot of places we will see facial recognition framed positively as just an extension of video surveillance   said Clare Garvie  an associate at the Center on Privacy and Technology at Georgetown Law Center   But the reality is it is a way to require  or in secret  have everyone in a crowd show their papers  essentially  to compare them to a big enough database  The Garden   home to the N B A  s Knicks and the N H L  s Rangers  and host to events like boxing matches  concerts and the Grammy Awards   was already known for having tight security  There is always a heavy police presence in part because the arena is in the heart of Midtown Manhattan and is built above Pennsylvania Station  the nation s busiest rail terminal  Fans attending events go through security screening that can include metal detectors  bag searches and explosive sniffing dogs The use of facial recognition technology puts the arena in the vanguard of professional sports facilities  At least two other arenas have experimented with the technology  but teams and leagues are generally unwilling to discuss security protocols  so it is difficult to know for sure how widespread it is  Nothing is more important to us than the safety and security of the fans  players  team and arena staff at our games   said Mike Bass  a spokesman for the N B A   The league and our teams are exploring the use of all state of the art technology  including facial recognition  to ensure that we have industry best security measures to protect all those in our arenas  The N H L  declined to comment Although security is the most obvious use of the technology  some independent experts say it is less effective as a security measure for private businesses because they do not have access to various watch lists held by law enforcement agencies  In fact  some vendors and team officials said the customer engagement and marketing capabilities of facial recognition are even more valuable than added security for sports facilities Law enforcement agencies have used facial recognition technology for many years  but some commercial entities have been wary  Walmart is among those that have experimented with it  to help identify shoplifters  drawing strong objections from privacy groups The software can be used to determine who is allowed into a building  like vendors or workers at a specified employee entrance  Companies may eventually be able to use the technology to increase customer engagement  In the case of an arena  a sports fan might sign up for a loyalty program with a team and attach his image and a credit card to the account  He could then park without paying an attendant  walk in without having a ticket scanned and pay for merchandise and concessions without ever taking out his wallet Even without fans signing up for anything  the cameras can give teams a much better sense of who is attending a game  Currently  teams might know who originally bought a ticket  but after the ticket enters the secondary market  teams do not necessarily know who is sitting in the seat  The days of having 40 000 to 60 000 people in the stadium and not knowing who they are  I think those days are going to disappear   said Charles Carroll  a senior vice president at IDEMIA  which manages the Transportation Security Administration s PreCheck program  IDEMIA has partnered with three sports venues on security  including Barclays Center in Brooklyn  to offer expedited lines to enter Allen Ganz  a director of critical infrastructure at NEC Corporation of America  an industry leader in facial recognition  said his company s system could  estimate anonymously the age and gender of people coming into the stadium   An electronic advertising board connected to the system could even be changed depending upon the age and gender of who is standing in front of it Ganz declined to disclose which sports arenas use NEC technology  Peter Trepp  the chief executive of FaceFirst  said  very  very few  stadiums and arenas were using facial recognition technology In addition to Madison Square Garden  at least two other arenas are known to be experimenting with the technology  According to a Sacramento Kings spokeswoman  facial recognition is used to allow players and staff to enter the practice facility connected to the Golden 1 Center  but its use has not expanded to event attendees The Dallas Mavericks have contracted with Suspect Technologies to experiment with facial recognition outside the team s locker room and throughout the American Airlines Center Mavericks owner Mark Cuban  however  said in an email the team needs to  find the right application that creates so much value people want to use it   He said that  for now  facial recognition doesn t improve his arena s ability to keep out unwanted patrons enough to justify its implementation  In the private sector  facial recognition is really only as good as the database it is compared against   said Michael Downing  the former deputy chief of the Los Angeles Police Department and chief security adviser for the Oak View Group There is no federal law governing the use of facial recognition technology  though both Illinois and Texas have laws that restrict its use without informed consent  Facebook has been sued under Illinois law  a case that could challenge its business model  and according to the Center for Public Integrity  is lobbying against similar laws being passed in other states  We are in a kind of legal Wild West when it comes to this stuff   said Jay Stanley  a policy analyst at the American Civil Liberties Union  While most sports fans may not have a legal right to know their face is being tracked  Stanley said he believed there is an ethical right to know  I should know if I am being subject to facial recognition if I am going into any business  including a stadium   he said   Even if you are just running my face against a list of people who have been banned from the premises and doing nothing else with it  I want to know  I have a right to know  
 Hello Bill Hamilton   The silver kiosk displayed its welcome when I swiped the black wristband that was my admission ticket The days of slipping through the back of a tailor s shop are long gone I was standing before the first of 12 information gathering sentinels at Spyscape  a  50 million  60 000 square foot spying and espionage museum  which opened recently in mid Manhattan With leading questions and embarrassing exercises  the kiosks were assessing me   personality traits  risk tolerance and I Q    to construct a profile of the kind of spy I might best be Spyscape is the newest unhidden headquarters of our cultural fascination with the art of deception  two levels inside a nondescript glass box building on 8th Avenue at 55th Street  Its dark  labyrinthine interior landscape was designed by David Adjaye  the architect of the National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington  D C The kiosk would like me to agree or disagree with a few statements  I ll say anything to get what I want   it declared in a light tone of conspiracy  I gave that idea a dissembling 3 on a scale of 1 to 5  from  strongly disagree  to  strongly agree   I m willing to be unethical if I believe it will help me succeed   I squashed that with a 1   I keep others at a distance   Well  now that you mention it  4  This is like dating   I said to Aaron Moody  a visitor services associate In fact  espionage may be bigger than courtship on social media right now  with Facebook at the center of a growing controversy over the use of personal data during elections  and the park bench poisoning of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter drawing international censure  Seismic private information hacks reveal themselves with regularity  in government and business  We accept drone patrolled  surveillance prying public space  Cyber warfare has come of age  and the Cold War is back  Scary biscuits   as the English say  I thought that spy stories were really a thing of the  70s   Mr  Adjaye said in an interview   And here we are at this time  that actually spying is back  Asked how confident he was in the security of his own personal information  on a scale of 1 to 10   with 10 being most secure   Mr  Adjaye said   Three  What is it about the shadows of deception that excites our participation and not our fear  The International Spy Museum in Washington  with its impressive collection of spy artifacts  will be moving to a greatly expanded facility next year  A new National Museum of Intelligence and Special Operations  under development in Ashburn  Va   is expected to open in 2020 Conceived as an entertainment attraction  Spyscape s  39 experience   32 for children ages 3 to 12   bring them  you ll need them  is a cultural chimera  part museum  part ride  It was created by Archimedia  a London based private investment group that has been a developer in resorts  restaurants  and spy themed film productions like the television adaptation of John le Carré s  The Night Manager  Spyscape s immersive experience begins in the outsize elevator  which makes a slow three minute ascent  The Briefing Lift  as it s called  delivers the visitor into Spyscape s realm with a three walled video created by Territory Studio in London  which worked on  Blade Runner 2049  The doors open  you have arrived at the 25 foot high  city within

 113 live cameras and 32 projectors telling Spyscape s stories  There are also games called  challenges  and the kiosks The stories are all real life   no fictional spies like James Bond  The

Scary biscuits I am inside a black booth  facing a black glass monitor  There is a heartbeat playing  Or are my ears pounding  Nick Ryan  a sound artist whose clients have included Tate Britain in London  designed Spyscape s aural landscape  which is as originally and meticulously rendered as Mr  Adjaye s architecture  Hello Bill Hamilton  Welcome to Deception  I am being tested for how well I lie and how well I detect lies  I stare at a grid on the monitor  which registers my face  and begins a live feed of me at the bottom  I put my fingertip on a red sensor  which takes my pulse  Have you ever been to space  What did you like about it   Yes  It wasn t New York   I lie  The screen replays my face  My eyes are blinking like signal lamps  People blink more when lying   the booth says empathetically  It knows I know I ve failed Spyscape s experience is mildly paranoiac  but it is never deadly dark  Its affirmative message   on T shirts and tote bags   is  Question Everything   Be your own information gatherer  Who would argue with that  There are no rendition programs or extraditions here   Shelby Prichard  Spyscape s chief of staff  who previously worked for the 9 11 Museum  said that the information gathered here was not shared externally or sold  In a timely way  Spyscape shows us what we know  but choose to ignore  that espionage and spying are not only the stuff of extraordinary tales or specialists  tools  They are the  enemies among us    the CCTVs  the closed circuit tracking systems  the browser cookies  There is a double agent in every pocket   Mobile phones are the most powerful spy devices of all   the Briefing Lift explains Hakeen Betts  the retail associate who sold me John le Carré s  The Pigeon Tunnel  in Spyscape s exhaustive bookshop  told me that on a visit  his 10 year old son was evaluated and told he was a  spymaster   based on his performance with the interactivities All 10 year olds are spymasters now  At the Encryption challenge

hacker    a risk taker  He praised the museum s immersive nature  I loved the code breaking  I loved the laser exhibition   Mr  Amendola said  adding that he learned a great deal  too  He compared Spyscape to a recent visit to the Museum of Sex on lower Fifth Avenue   It s an interesting concept   Mr  Amendola said of MoSex   but I thought it felt a little underwhelming  If you can beat sex  you re in like Flint 
MILAN   Stephen K  Bannon leaned back in an armchair opposite a copy of a painting by an Italian old master and explained his modest efforts to build a vast network of European populists to demolish the Continent s political establishment  All I m trying to be   he said   is the infrastructure  globally  for the global populist movement  Just that Only months ago  Mr  Bannon was forced out of the White House and Breitbart News  the alt right news empire he helped make into a political force  for the sharp criticisms of President Trump s children attributed to him in a book   He s lost his mind   Mr  Trump said at the time But now Mr  Bannon  the architect of Mr  Trump s populist campaign message and the president s former chief strategist  has returned with an international mission On Saturday  he is set to headline the annual conference of France s far right National Front in the northern city of Lille  where he will be introduced by its leader  Marine Le Pen  People with knowledge of Mr  Bannon s itinerary suggested that he might meet later in the weekend with the Hungarian prime minister  Viktor Orban  but Mr  Bannon declined to say whether or not he would  only saying that he admired Mr  Orban as a  hero  and  the most significant guy on the scene right now  In Zurich  Mr  Bannon says  he had a  fascinating  meeting on Tuesday with leaders of Germany s far right Alternative for Germany party They included Alice Weidel and Beatrix von Storch  who recently reacted to a New Year s Eve public service announcement by the German police that went out in various languages  including Arabic  by tweeting   Are they seeking to appease the barbaric  Muslim  rapist hordes of men  But it is Italy  where populist forces smashed the country s establishment by combining to win more than half the vote on Sunday  that Mr  Bannon has turned into his de facto headquarters In a sprawling interview here  he declined to name whom he had met  other than to describe them as a broad array of politicians  operatives and investors  A spokesman for Matteo Salvini  the leader of the anti immigrant League  said the two would have liked to have met  but did not  A spokesman for the anti establishment Five Star Movement  which won a third of Italian votes  did not return a request for comment  Aside from the occasional coffee at Campo de  Fiori or photo op at Piazza Navona  Mr  Bannon has been holed up in hotel rooms  taking meeting after meeting In Rome  he stayed at the luxurious Raphael hotel  where Bettino Craxi  the face of Italy s corrupt establishment and mentor to Silvio Berlusconi  was pelted with coins in 1993 by an angry mob as he departed the political scene In Milan  he sat in a room at the grand Principe di Savoia  opposite a copy of Titian s portrait of the Duke of Mantua  a master of intrigue in Renaissance Italy and a longtime sufferer of syphilis  surrounded by red damask wallpaper  Jams were on a room service cart  and a copy of a book titled  Headlines All My Life  was on the desk In both cities  he wore a blue and white striped button down over a polo shirt  In Rome the polo was orange  In Milan it was blue He sipped sparkling water and described a grand vision for a global populist future In the United States  Mr  Bannon said  he is working on a project to create a think tank to  weaponize  populist economic and social ideas He sees that work spreading to Europe  where a proliferation of populist websites in the image of Breitbart News  either owned by him or others  will spread those ideas  under his guidance As a final component  he wants to train an army of populist foot soldiers in the language and tools of social media Mr  Bannon said that a common message he had received from populists throughout Europe was a desire to establish a media outlet for their views  They see what Breitbart did and they want it in their own language   said Mr  Bannon  who slipped into the present tense when talking about the website from which he recently separated   That s the key  Right now my sites are in English  they want one in their own language   he said  calling that  phase two  He could be forgiven the slip  as the site still seems to be in his thrall    Stephen K  Bannon took Zurich by storm Tuesday  addressing a sell out crowd   began Breitbart s article on the speech  But Mr  Bannon  who said he was paying for the trip  said he was weighing whether to buy a name brand outlet  like Newsweek or United Press International  or to start a new one  or to connect entrepreneurs with capital or invest himself He imagined a scoop driven and high metabolism outlet  like Axios   he said  referring to the buzzy Washington newsletter  but with a populist bent that would devour Europe s sleepy legacy papers  Whether I do it or a local entrepreneur does it   he said   there are going to be these populist nationalist news sites that pop up in the next year on line  That will only take these things to the next level  With Europe more aggressively tackling the migration issue  Mr  Bannon was aiming to move the future battle of populism to other terrains He said that the reason it was so important to get populist nationalist governments in place was to prepare for a coming great powers clash with an axis of ancient Turkish  Persian and Chinese civilizations   Elites can t fight that fight   he said   Because people have to buy into it  He is also increasingly interested in motivating people to fight media conglomerates like Facebook that monetize their data  And he has become fascinated with crypto currencies and how they can help populist movements  the subject of a speech he gave in Zurich this week In preparation for the speech  organized by Die Weltwoche  a conservative Swiss magazine  Mr  Bannon said he visited the town of Zug  known as Crypto Valley for its bustling cryptocurrency industry  He was impressed  If Brussels and the European Central Bank is worried about Italy going to the lira  their concerns should be that all these communities and states are going to crypto   he said in Milan In the meantime  he said  he admires Italy s populist parties for already being on the technological cutting edge The Five Star Movement  a web based party that preaches direct  online democracy  and the League  the hard right  formerly northern based secessionist party  both dominated social media during the campaign Often  their critics say  they did it with spurious and inflammatory fake news about migrants and crime  Many of those messages seemed propelled by automated bots rather than real supporters  You can t just have just all humans  I m sure they have some bots   Mr  Bannon said  unbothered   The thing is that they are generating enthusiasm on shoestrings  He said he hoped the two parties would eventually join forces   something not out of the question as the Italians try to form a government after an inconclusive election But he spoke also almost sympathetically about Matteo Renzi  the now vanquished Italian leader who only years ago seemed to be the future of Italy and the European center left Mr  Renzi  he said  was  an object lesson to every rising politician in Europe   and not a good one The former prime minister  he said  had tried to play by Brussels s rules when it came to the migration crisis  and instead the European Union allowed other countries to close their borders  leaving Italy to take the brunt of the burden  They hung him out to dry   he said Mr  Bannon said Italian voters on Sunday also spurned Pope Francis  who has urged tolerance for migrants  This vote was a rejection of the pope   said Mr  Bannon  a Catholic who has nonetheless been a longtime critic of the pope s politics   The pope likes to see himself as a radical and an anti establishment revolutionary for the little guy  the little guy put the pope in his place on Sunday  He said he had intended to return to Rome to visit his allies in the Vatican  including the American cardinal Raymond Burke  but then France s National Front extended its invitation  They said   Hey would you stay for the weekend     Mr  Bannon said     All our people would love to hear you speak    
Updated 12 59 p m Good Tuesday morning  It s the calm before the storm Get ready for another whack of winter An approaching nor easter is threatening to dump up to a foot of snow on the city and parts of New Jersey  and up to 15 inches in Westchester  even as the region is still reeling from last week s winter storm Most of the snowfall and dangerous travel conditions will occur on Wednesday  according to the National Weather Service  A winter storm warning goes into effect at midnight tonight and will remain in place until Thursday morning At least eight people died and more than two million people were left without power after a  bomb cyclone  slammed into the Mid Atlantic and Northeast on Friday  Here in New York  trains halted  more than 400 flights were delayed or canceled  and 132 000 customers were left without power  according to Con Edison Some 400 mutual aid workers from as far Canada  Texas and Wisconsin were called in to help restore power to the area  This morning  more than 28 000 customers in the five boroughs and Westchester were still without power  Con Edison said While wind gusts during tomorrow s storm are not expected to be as strong as Friday s  which downed dozens of trees and apparently ripped the roof off a hangar at La Guardia Airport  heavy snowfall could snap weakened branches  causing more damage and knocking out power  said Alfonso Quiroz  a Con Edison spokesman To prepare for power failures  the National Weather Service suggests charging phones  gathering basic supplies and turning your refrigerator and freezer to a colder setting  During a power failure  make sure appliances are switched off  keep the fridge closed and stay away from downed power lines Today will feel eerily calm  with sunny skies and a high near 44

MONTREAL   On one side of a grand square near the old Port of Montreal is a sculpture of a Frenchwoman in a Chanel suit  clasping a poodle and sneering at the Bank of Montreal  a former symbol of British colonial rule built in 1847 On the opposite end  a dapper Englishman  cast in bronze  holds a pug and stares condescendingly at Notre Dame Basilica  an emblem of French Quebec s influence under the Roman Catholic Church The poodle and the pug stare longingly at each other The sculptures are a powerful metaphor for this city  which has long been polarized by what the celebrated Canadian novelist Hugh MacLennan called the  Two Solitudes    the perception  fairly or not  that French  and English speaking Quebecers coexist uneasily I recently returned home to Montreal after 28 years abroad  curious to discover whether the two solitudes still existed After all  Montreal today  reflecting a bilingual multicultural Canada  is a swaggering metropolis of about 1 8 million people in the province of Quebec  shaped by the forces of globalization and immigration Yet Quebec s longstanding cultural battles over language still simmer  And the city   with its Anglophone minority and Francophone majority surrounded by an Anglophone majority in the rest of the country   itself remains somewhat bifurcated Still  if lingering divisions remain  they appear to be predominantly along generational lines When I came of age in the 1980s around Westmount  a traditionally Anglophone enclave on the southwestern slope of Mount Royal that gave the world Leonard Cohen  Quebec had just been consumed by a referendum on independence  and thousands of English speaking Quebecers were leaving the province The stop signs in my neighborhood were routinely vandalized to say  Arrête 101   or Stop 101  a reference to Bill 101  a 1977 law that made French the official language of government and courts in Quebec  and requires that French lettering be twice as big as English on public signs and that immigrants send their children to French only schools While I studied Flaubert  learned Quebec s history at school and bantered in French during hockey practice  I spoke English at home  watched American sitcoms and lived in a separate but parallel universe from my French Canadian peers Fast forward three decades  and separatism is largely in retreat  One in four Anglophones in Quebec marry French Quebecers I live on Plateau Mont Royal  a predominantly Francophone neighborhood in the east of Montreal  Twentysomething Francophone shopkeepers answer me in fluent English when I address them in French  and residents of all linguistic persuasions seem more obsessed by their search for the perfect latte than whether you order it in the language of Shakespeare or Molière Recent census figures show that 45 percent of people in Quebec speak both French and English Xavier Dolan  28  one of Quebec s   and Canada s   most celebrated film directors  recalled that when his parents lived in the predominantly Anglophone neighborhood of NDG in the 1980s  his mother couldn t wait to leave because she was taunted by Anglophones telling her to  speak white   a slur used to denigrate those speaking other languages in public Today s younger generation  he said  had discarded the hang ups of their parents  There is a shift in the younger generation   he said   In my case  English meant Hollywood  it was film  it was  Titanic   so I wanted to speak English as quickly as I could  Brian Myles  the editor of Le Devoir  the influential left leaning Quebecois daily  argued that the  two solitudes  were a thing of the past  Today the French speak English and the English speak French  and that didn t exist when you had the two solitudes   he said But he also cautioned that language laws were still necessary to protect French language and culture in Quebec because globalization and the internet are eroding the language Snaking through the heart of Montreal is  St  Laurent Boulevard  a long and storied street peppered with Jewish delis  Portuguese chicken rotisserie joints and former brothels reincarnated as luxury condominiums  Historically  Francophones lived to the east of St  Laurent while Anglophones lived to the west Today  gaggles of French  English  Chinese and Indian students sit hunched over computers at cafes  chatting on Facebook or writing on Twitter But   a Berlin Wall of the mind lingers While the younger generation of Anglophone residents will confidently pronounce  St  Laurent   some of their parents stubbornly cling to  St  Lawrence  While Anglos read The Montreal Gazette or turn to the CBC for their news  Francophones read La Presse or Le Devoir or watch TVA  Utter the name Xavier Dolan or Marie Mai  a wildly popular Quebec singer  to an Anglophone Montrealer  and you risk being greeted by a blank stare  It is taboo to talk about the two solitudes  because we are supposed to pretend that we all get along when we are  in many ways  still separate   said Heather O Neill  a Montreal based Anglophone novelist  who has daringly explored the city s decadent underworld from the perspective of French Quebecois characters When her daughter was 9 years old  Ms  O Neill sent her to a French elementary school  where  she recalled  she was chided by a teacher for speaking English with a Russian girl in the schoolyard Then there are the political fissures Voters in all the districts west of St  Laurent Boulevard have supported the federalist Liberal party of Quebec over the past decade  according to voting data from Quebec s Director General of Elections Half of the districts to the east  where a majority of Francophone Montrealers live  have been won by separatist parties like the Parti Québécois or  more recently  the leftist Québec Solidaire In December  provincial legislators unanimously passed a resolution calling for shopkeepers to stop saying  Bonjour hi  when they greet customers and to say simply  Bonjour  instead Meanwhile  Valérie Plante  the outward looking mayor of Montreal  was recently criticized for releasing highlights of the city s budget in English  You d think we were at the Parliament in Ottawa  rather than Montreal City Hall  a Quebec metropolis   fumed Maxime Laporte  the president of the Saint Jean Baptiste Society  an organization devoted to preserving French culture Chloe Molson  a university student with a Francophone mother and an Anglophone father  said that when she sometimes used English to greet customers at the Westmount supermarket where she works part time  they sometimes rebuked her  One woman said to me   Don t you understand French     she said But her Anglo friends sometimes become panicked when addressed in French Still  walking down St  Laurent Boulevard shows the unity  not the division of the city Lenny Lighter  the owner of Moishes s  a fabled steakhouse on the boulevard  which his father  Moishe  won in a poker game in 1938  recalled that when he was growing up in the 1950s  most of Moishes s customers were English speaking Jewish immigrants  Today  he proudly noted  the restaurant hosts dozens of young French Quebecois each week  You still have people on both sides who can t talk to one another  but in everyday life the barriers have come down  A few streets farther east on Avenue du Mont Royal  Marie Bouchard  a 23 year old political science student at Université de Montréal  was munching on a sandwich at a cafe She said her favorite television show was the British science fiction series  Black Mirror   while she loved French Quebecois pop music and adored her large group of Anglo friends  I love French  it s my language   she said  quickly adding   But if I only spoke French  it would limit my horizons  
WASHINGTON   As Russia s virtual war against the United States continues unabated with the midterm elections approaching  the State Department has yet to spend any of the  120 million it has been allocated since late 2016 to counter foreign efforts to meddle in elections or sow distrust in democracy As a result  not one of the 23 analysts working in the department s Global Engagement Center   which has been tasked with countering Moscow s disinformation campaign   speaks Russian  and a department hiring freeze has hindered efforts to recruit the computer experts needed to track the Russian efforts The delay is just one symptom of the largely passive response to the Russian interference by President Trump  who has made little if any public effort to rally the nation to confront Moscow and defend democratic institutions  More broadly  the funding lag reflects a deep lack of confidence by Secretary of State Rex W  Tillerson in his department s ability to execute its historically wide ranging mission and spend its money wisely Mr  Tillerson has voiced skepticism that the United States is even capable of doing anything to counter the Russian threat  If it s their intention to interfere  they re going to find ways to do that   Mr  Tillerson said in an interview last month with Fox News   And we can take steps we can take  but this is something that once they decide they are going to do it  it s very difficult to pre empt it  The United States spends billions of dollars on secret cybercapabilities  but these weapons have proved largely ineffective against Russian efforts on Facebook  Twitter and elsewhere that simply amplify or distort divisive but genuine voices in the United States and elsewhere The role for the Global Engagement Center would be to assess Russian efforts and then set about amplifying a different set of voices to counter them  perhaps creating a network of anti propaganda projects dispersed around the world  experts said  There are now thousands of former Russian journalists who have been exiled or fired who are doing counter Russian stuff in exile who we could help   said Richard Stengel  who as the under secretary for public diplomacy in the Obama administration had oversight of the Global Engagement Center Concerted campaigns to highlight the roles of Russian troll farms or Russian mercenaries in Ukraine and Syria could have a profound effect  Mr  Stengel said At the end of the Obama administration  Congress directed the Pentagon to send  60 million to the State Department so it could coordinate governmentwide efforts  including those by the Defense Department and the Department of Homeland Security  to counter anti democratic propaganda by Russia and China  This messaging effort is separate from other potential government actions like cyberattacks Mr  Tillerson spent seven months trying to decide whether to spend any of the money  The State Department finally sent a request to the Defense Department on Sept  18 to transfer the funds  but with just days left in the fiscal year  Pentagon officials decided that the State Department had lost its shot at the money With another  60 million available for the next fiscal year  the two departments dickered for another five months over how much the State Department could have After The New York Times  following a report on the issue by Politico in August  began asking about the delayed money  the State Department announced on Monday that the Pentagon had agreed to transfer  40 million for the effort  just a third of what was originally intended State Department officials say they expect to receive the money in April  Steve Goldstein  the under secretary for public diplomacy  said he would contribute  1 million from his own budget to  kick start the initiative quickly   This funding is critical to ensuring that we continue an aggressive response to malign influence and disinformation   Mr  Goldstein said On Wednesday  Mark E  Mitchell  a top official in the Defense Department  said much wrangling remained before any of the promised  40 million is transferred to the State Department  We re still a ways off   Mr  Mitchell said The delays have infuriated some members of Congress  which approved the funding transfer with bipartisan support  It is well past time that the State Department s Global Engagement Center gets the resources Congress intended for it to effectively fight Kremlin sponsored disinformation and other foreign propaganda operations   Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey  the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee  said on Wednesday Adele Ruppe  the center s chief of staff  defended the administration s broader efforts to counter Russian propaganda  pointing out that the State Department had provided  1 3 billion in assistance in 2017 to strengthen European resilience to Russian meddling  But that money was largely obligated during the Obama administration  and the Trump administration has proposed slashing that assistance by more than half for the coming year  to  527 million  and to  491 million for the next year While it waits for the funding transfer from the Pentagon  the center  which has a staff of around 60 people  including 23 contract analysts  will continue working on its original mission  countering jihadist and extremist propaganda Most of the center s leaders are working in temporary assignments  a product of Mr  Tillerson s halt in promotions  The analysts work in a warren of cubicles in the basement of a tired building that once housed the Office of Strategic Services  the World War II predecessor to the C I A The analysts are divided into five teams that largely work in four languages  Arabic  Urdu  French and Somali  The analysts said in interviews that they had notched some significant victories  including a video montage proving that the Islamic State had itself destroyed Al Nuri Grand Mosque in Mosul  Iraq  and a widely seen cartoon in French depicting the miserable life of an Islamic State fighter Still  these efforts are a small fraction of what Congress envisioned  A 2015 internal assessment found that the Islamic State had been far more nimble on social media than the United States had been  In May  Congress more than doubled the center s budget  providing an additional  19 million over its earlier budget of  14 million  But by Jan  1  the department had spent just  3 6 million of the additional  19 million  Mr  Goldstein said James K  Glassman  the under secretary for public diplomacy during the George W  Bush administration  said the center s uncertain funding and temporary leadership reflected the administration s lack of interest in countering either jihadist or Russian propaganda  They ve got the vehicle to do this work in the center   Mr  Glassman said   What they don t have is a secretary of state or a president who s interested in doing this work  Mr  Tillerson is focusing his energies instead on drastically shrinking the department  leaving a significant part of its budget unused and hundreds of important decisions unmade Last year  the State Department spent just 79 percent of the money that Congress had authorized for the conduct of foreign affairs  the lowest such level in at least 15 years and well down from the 93 percent spent in the final year of the Obama administration  according to an analysis of data from the Office of Management and Budget Because of the hiring and promotion freezes that have left large sums unspent  as well as Mr  Tillerson s refusal to delegate spending decisions  the department had a backlog of more than 1 400 official requests for Mr  Tillerson s signoff at the end of last year  according to a former senior diplomat who left the department then 
Need another excuse to put off washing dirty dishes or doing laundry How about this  It s raining outside New York City is calling on residents in parts of Brooklyn and Queens to cut back their water use during rainstorms by postponing showers and other chores   even waiting to flush toilets  The reason is that household sewage flows into the same underground sewer pipes that also collect rainwater runoff from rooftops and streets When those pipes are overloaded with rainwater  the combined overflow is then discharged directly into nearby rivers  bays and creeks instead of going to wastewater treatment plants The new  Wait    campaign is the latest strategy by the city s Department of Environmental Protection to reduce so called  combined sewer overflows  that have long polluted local waterways  closed down beaches and plagued recreational sports  Today  about 20 billion gallons of combined sewer overflows are discharged annually into waterways  down from nearly 110 billion gallons in 1985  according to city officials  Typically  about 90 percent of that combined overflow is rainwater runoff By now  many New Yorkers are accustomed to doing their part for the environment by recycling trash  saying no to plastic shopping bags and using air conditioning sparingly on hot summer days  But even the most conscientious residents may not necessarily make the connection between the water that swirls down their drains during a rainstorm and the resulting sewer overflows that muck up the rivers where they sail or kayak  We take it for granted  you flush your toilet and it goes away   said Willis Elkins  a program manager for the Newtown Creek Alliance  a nonprofit advocacy and educational group that helped conceive the idea for the campaign   Unfortunately  we have such a vast and old sewer system in the city  it can t always handle excessive rain  Angela Licata  a deputy commissioner for the Department of Environmental Protection  said that in about 60 percent of the city s sewer system  the same pipe is used to collect rainwater and sewage from homes and businesses  mainly in areas with older infrastructure  It was not until the 1950s that the city began building separate lines to avoid overloading the sewer system   We re grappling with this very difficult legacy problem   she said The city has spent more than  45 billion since the 1980s to improve wastewater treatment and reduce the discharge of combined sewer overflows  resulting in waterways that are the cleanest in more than a century It has built and upgraded wastewater treatment plants  and is spending about  1 5 billion just on green projects such as installing  curbside rain gardens  and other infrastructure in parks  playgrounds and public housing projects to absorb storm water and keep it out of the sewer system  It also plans to disinfect some sewer overflows before they are discharged from sewer lines by using a chlorination process in the pipes In total  the city has 14 wastewater treatment plants that process an average of 1 3 billion gallons of sewage on rainless days  They can generally handle up to 3 billion gallons per day The new campaign aims to reduce the combined sewer overflows into Newtown Creek  a 3 5 mile long waterway that forms part of the border between Brooklyn and Queens  and Bowery Bay  and Flushing Bay and Flushing Creek in northern Queens To sign up volunteers  the city will run ads on Facebook  partner with local environmental groups  and mail fliers to about 30 000 homes in two dozen neighborhoods that lie in the drainage areas for those waterways  including Williamsburg  Greenpoint  Astoria  Steinway  Jackson Heights  Elmhurst  and Corona  The campaign will focus on those living in single family homes because their water usage data will be easier to collect and analyze  according to city officials who hope to eventually expand it to apartment buildings too One recruitment pitch compares the overflows to a familiar problem   It s like rush hour on the freeway  there s only so much road and if everyone uses it at the same time  it can get jammed  And just like rush hour  the best thing to do is avoid it  City officials will monitor real time rainfall data at the Newtown Creek and Bowery Bay treatment plants to determine when combined sewer overflows are likely  Once gauges at the plants register a half inch of rainfall  volunteers will be sent a text message asking them to wait to use water  After the storm ends  and plant operations return to normal  they will receive a second text thanking them The new campaign has cost about  120 000 to develop and put into effect It grew out of an earlier effort by the Newtown Creek Alliance  which enlisted several dozen residents to curtail water use during rainstorms in 2014  Two years later  officials expanded upon that idea for a six month pilot project in neighborhoods around Newtown Creek  enlisting 379 volunteers from more than 200 buildings  Of those  only nine quit the program  mostly because they were moving away from the area During the pilot project  volunteers were asked to wait a total of 13 times   with the average wait lasting a little over seven hours  By the end  there was a 5 percent drop in the average daily water consumption in the buildings where the volunteers lived Sarah Lilley  52  a freelance public radio producer in Williamsburg  did not find it hard to give up water at certain times  She postponed showers and kept toilet flushing to a minimum   You re just talking about a rainstorm  you re not talking about a weeklong blizzard   she said Ms  Lilley became so well trained that she continued to do those things on her own after the pilot project ended   I m the one who knows that I could have had the sink running for 45 minutes after that dinner party and I didn t   she said   I know the amount of water I did not use   and I can envision it not flowing down the street  and not picking up trash as it goes  Another volunteer  Sarah Balistreri  38  a school curriculum specialist who lives in Greenpoint  said she sometimes had to shower before going to work  but she made it quick  And she washed laundry if it was her only block of time to get it done for the week   I felt bad   she said   I wasn t a perfect participant  But those were the exceptions   My behavior over all has changed   said Ms  Balistreri  who kayaks on Newtown Creek and has enjoyed the benefits of cleaner water firsthand To make sure she never missed a text  she even programmed the number into her cellphone along with an image of a poop emoji  It s still on her phone  It s a reminder    she said   of what this is all about  
KENNEDY SPACE CENTER  Fla    The search for cosmic real estate is about to begin anew No earlier than 6 32 p m  on April 16  in NASA s fractured parlance  a little spacecraft known as the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite  or TESS  bristling with cameras and ambition  will ascend on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket in a blaze of smoke and fire and take up a lengthy residence between the moon and the Earth There it will spend the next two years  at least  scanning the sky for alien worlds TESS is the latest effort to try to answer questions that have intrigued humans for millenniums and dominated astronomy for the last three decades  Are we alone  Are there other Earths  Evidence of even a single microbe anywhere else in the galaxy would rock science Not so long ago  astronomers didn t know if there were planets outside our solar system or  if there were  whether they could ever be found  But starting with the 1995 discovery of a planet circling the sunlike star 51 Pegasi  there has been a revolution NASA s Kepler spacecraft  launched in 2009  discovered some 4 000 possible planets in one small patch of the Milky Way near the constellation Cygnus  Kepler went on to survey other star fields only briefly after its pointing system broke  After nine years in space  it s running out of fuel Thanks to efforts like Kepler s  astronomers now think there are billions of potentially habitable planets in our galaxy  which means the nearest one could be as close as 10 to 15 light years from here And so the torch is passed  It s now TESS s job to find those nearby planets  the ones close enough to scrutinize with telescopes  or even for an interstellar robot to visit  Most of the stars with planets are far away   said Sara Seager  a planetary scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a member of the TESS team  referring to Kepler s bounty   TESS will fill in planets around nearby stars  George Ricker  an M I T  researcher and the leader of the TESS team  expects to find some 500 Earth sized planets within 300 light years of here  close enough for a coming generation of telescopes on the ground and in space to examine for habitability   or perhaps even inhabitants But there will be more than planets in the universe  according to TESS  TESS is going to be a lot of fun   Dr  Ricker said   There are 20 million stars we can look at   The spacecraft will be able to do precise brightness measurements of every glint in the heavens  he said   Galaxies  stars  active galactic nuclei   his voice trailing off Most of the exoplanets will be orbiting stars called red dwarfs  much smaller and cooler than the sun  They make up the vast majority of stars in our neighborhood  and in the universe  and presumably lay claim to most of the planets Like Kepler  TESS will hunt those planets by monitoring the light from stars and detecting slight dips  momentary fading indicating that a planet has passed in front of its star The mission s planners say they eventually expect to catalog 20 000 new exoplanet candidates of all shapes and sizes  In particular  they have promised to come up with the masses and orbits of 50 new planets that are less than four times the size of the Earth Most of the planets in the universe are in this range   between the sizes of Earth and Neptune  But since there are no examples of them in our own solar system  as Dr  Seager notes   we don t know anything about them  Are they so called  superearths   mostly rock with a veil of atmosphere  or  mini Neptunes  with small cores buried deep inside extensive balls of gas Data from Kepler and astronomers suggests that the difference is mass  fertile rocks often are less than one and a half times the size of the Earth  while barren ice clouds often are bigger  Where the line really is  and how many planets fall on one side or the other  could determine how many worlds out there are balls of freezing vapor or potential gardens  We need to make precise mass measurements   said David Latham of the Harvard Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics  who is in charge of organizing astronomers to follow up the TESS observations To that end  the team has procured 80 nights of observing time a year for the next five years on a spectrograph called Harps North  which resides on an Italian telescope on the island of La Palma in the Canary Islands  a part of Spain off the coast of Africa Harps   for High Accuracy Radial velocity Planet Searcher   can measure the mass of a planet by how much it makes its home star wobble as it goes around in an orbit  Such measurements  if precise enough could help distinguish the composition and structure of these bodies TESS is one of NASA s smaller missions  with a budget of  200 million  by comparison  Kepler had a budget of about  650 million Recently TESS  partly clad in shiny aluminum foil  stubby solar panels folded modestly against its side  was sitting on a round pedestal inside a plastic tent  The tent occupied one corner of a cavernous  clean room  in a remote building on the scrubby outskirts of the space center here  amid palms and canals and flocks of cormorants The spacecraft is about the size of a bulky  oddly shaped refrigerator  festooned not with magnets but with mysterious nozzles and connectors  Four pairs of blue clad legs were sticking out from underneath the pedestal  as if high tech mechanics were working under a car The engineers were taping plaques to the bottom of the spacecraft  including a memory chip containing drawings by schoolchildren who had been asked to imagine exoplanets might look like Standing to the side  in a  bunny suit  of protective material that left only his bespectacled eyes visible  Dr  Ricker was staring into the tent at his new spacecraft  as if he were watching his car get fixed  and exchanging rocket talk with the engineers who had designed and built it Dr  Ricker has been a rocket scientist  building astronomical satellites to be shot into space  for pretty much his entire career as a researcher at M I T  s Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research Most of his previous projects involved measuring X rays or gamma rays from various snaps  crackles and pops in the cosmos  most recently the High Energy Transient Explorer  used to study the cataclysms known as gamma ray bursts Asked if planets represented a departure for him  Dr  Ricker shrugged   Not so much   All his work has involved delicate measurements of things changing  what he called  time domain astronomy  The key to this work is to maintain very stable and sensitive detectors   the imaging chips that are elite relatives of the sensors in your smartphone   so that they can reliably record the changes in brightness  just a few parts per million  that signal a planet passing by its star Dr  Ricker said he and his colleagues had started  noodling  about a planet finding mission back in 2006  After they lost out in a competition for NASA s Small Explorers program  which are less expensive missions  the scientists re entered a competition for a larger mission in 2010   and won They had gone to great lengths to design a compact spacecraft that would fit the rockets NASA used for Small Explorers  and so were nonplused when NASA selected SpaceX s Falcon 9  which can carry a much larger payload  to launch the TESS mission This is the first time NASA has purchased a ride from SpaceX  the rocket company run by Elon Musk  for one of its science missions  All eyes will be on the launchpad  given SpaceX s history of occasionally providing unhappy  if spectacular   denouements to missions A report released this month by NASA showed that the space agency and SpaceX still disagree on what exactly went wrong two and a half years ago when a mission to resupply the International Space Station disintegrated in flight  In a second mishap in 2016  a Falcon 9 blew up during a launchpad test  destroying a communications satellite whose customers included Facebook Unbowed  SpaceX and its founder Mr  Musk have plowed on  with 22 consecutive launches of its Falcon and a maiden flight in February for the Falcon Heavy  the world s most powerful rocket  which shot  one of Mr  Musk s Tesla convertibles past Mars into orbit around the sun  TESS looks like a little toy inside the Falcon 9   Dr  Ricker said  But a toy with potential On top of the spacecraft are four small cameras  each with a 24 degree field of view  a stretch of sky about the size of the Orion constellation The cameras will stare at adjacent sections of sky for 27 days at a time  and then step to the next spot  In the course of the first year  the researchers will survey the entire southern hemisphere of the sky  in the second year  they will stitch together the northern sky  If the mission is extended beyond two years  they will repeat Dr  Ricker and his colleagues have prepared a list of 200 000 nearby stars whose brightness will be measured and reported every two minutes in what they call the spacecraft s  postage stamp  mode  Meanwhile  images of the entire 24 degree swaths of sky will be recorded every half hour That cadence is perfect for finding and studying current favorites in the race to locate habitable exoplanets  namely those circling the ubiquitous red dwarf stars  or M dwarfs  in astronomical jargon   This is the era of the M dwarf   Dr  Seager said Because they are so much cooler and less luminous than the sun  their  Goldilocks  zones   where in principle liquid water is possible   lie only a few million miles out from each star  instead of the 90 million miles from which the Earth circles the sun At the shorter distance  a year in the life of a red dwarf planet is only 10 to 30 days  If TESS is watching that bit of the sky for 27 days straight  it may see three dips in brightness because of transits  enough to certify the planet as a real candidate and to start investigating its reality But reality  as Dr  Seager noted  might not be the same as habitability  at least for the fragile likes of us  Red dwarfs are very unstable and given to violent solar flares  she said Analyzing data from an 80 day Kepler observation of the Trappist system  involving at least seven Earth sized planets tightly packed around a star about 40 light years from here  Hungarian astronomers counted 42 solar flares raining lethal radiation through the little planetary system At least one  Dr  Seager pointed out  was as energetic as a famous solar flare called the Carrington Event in 1859  which destroyed telegraph service on Earth and sent auroras as far south as the Equator  Personally  I will always hold out for the true Earth twin  one we feel a kinship with   Dr  Seager said  referring to a planet like ours that circles a bigger star like the sun To start its excellent adventure  TESS will be launched into an unusually eccentric orbit that takes the satellite all the way out to the moon at its farthest point  Gravitational interaction with the moon will then keep TESS in a stable 13 7 day orbit for as long as 1 000 years  Dr  Ricker said The great apogee  the farthest distance from Earth  will minimize obstruction and interference from our planet  The spacecraft will radio its data back once every orbit  when it is closest to Earth  at about 67 000 miles up Dr  Latham called it  a slick orbit   But it will take almost two months and many rocket burns to get there and begin to do science  If all goes well  that would be the middle of June Sometime during that process  Dr  Ricker said  the team will turn the spacecraft s cameras on the Earth for a last look at home Asked if he was ready to be Mr  Exoplanet  Dr  Ricker winced   What I m looking forward to   he said   is getting some data to look at  
Within 20 minutes of our interview  I knew a lot about Phillip Picardi  He is  for example  an Aries with a Leo rising and a Sagittarius moon  When he was in elementary school  he didn t smile for three years because he was  so inspired by Victoria Beckham and Posh Spice   In his teenage years  the background of his MySpace page was a  giant collage of shirtless dudes  We met for breakfast at the Odeon in TriBeCa  a restaurant that has become a meeting spot for the Condé Nast editors and executives who work about nine blocks away  at One World Trade Center  At age 26  Mr  Picardi  the head of Teen Vogue  is a rising star at this glossiest of magazine publishers  whose titles also include Vogue  The New Yorker  Vanity Fair and Architectural Digest  Anna Wintour  the empress of fashion and Condé Nast s artistic director  has signaled her approval of Mr  Picardi in ways big and small  and in a phone interview she described him to me as  marvelous  He has worked at Condé Nast more or less since he was a freshman at New York University    I heard the Olsen twins went there    and distinguished himself with his performance as the digital editorial director of Teen Vogue Under his guidance  the magazine s website reached a new audience when it published  soon after Election Day  an online opinion piece by Lauren Duca headlined  Donald Trump Is Gaslighting America   The  resistance crowd favorited it  the president elect s fans denounced it  and social media users in the habit of sharing New Republic think pieces were unexpectedly tweeting about a publication known for fashion tips and relationship advice Teen Vogue gained further momentum when Dan Rather wrote about it on his Facebook page and Tucker Carlson sparred with Ms  Duca on Fox News  After that  Trevor Noah welcomed Mr  Picardi and the Teen Vogue editor  Elaine Welteroth  to  The Daily Show   and the publication they oversaw was no longer just another magazine for adolescent girls Since then  Teen Vogue has shut down its print edition  but Mr  Picardi has collected new responsibilities  After Ms  Welteroth left Condé Nast in January  Condé Nast named him the chief content officer of Teen Vogue  He has also started a new digital project at the company  an L G B T  community platform called Them  which has drawn support from advertisers including Burberry  Google  Lyft and Glaad To Ms  Wintour  Mr  Picardi is someone who fits the cultural moment   he s the ideal promoter of a millennial flavored brand of anti Trump activism and identity politics that is gaining strength in a stormy political atmosphere  He understands how young people are thinking today   Ms  Wintour said   He s very activist  he s very engaged  He wants to make waves  which I think is important  He wants to cause a conversation  not in an angry way but in a helpful way  At the Odeon  Mr  Picardi wore an outfit he referred to as his  pajamas    midnight blue velvet pants and a matching shirt from the Sies Marjan label  Despite his swift rise at a company known for its Versailles style office politics  Mr  Picardi said he was not the calculating sort   I m never making an effort to behave any differently or modify my behavior   he said over poached eggs and avocado It is not difficult to see why Mr  Picardi   who goes by Phill  with two L s  thank you very much   has impressed his boss  particularly at a time when Condé Nast is looking for its next generation of  younger  cheaper  leaders  Even at his age  he is polished  with a repertoire of life affirming stories  One of his go tos   I got in trouble for bringing Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera CDs to second grade class because I was in Catholic school and they freaked out and said it was too sexual and I was like   That s the point   During our interview  Mr  Picardi noted that Teen Vogue s monthly traffic under his team had gone from two million unique visitors to 12 million   Not to toot my own horn  that is very hard   he said  Traffic has since fallen  but his success has resonated inside One World Trade  People in the building are always referring to things that were instituted at Teen Vogue and now at Them   said Amy Astley  the editor of Architectural Digest and a former editor of Teen Vogue  who hired Mr  Picardi as an intern   I honestly think that people in the company wish him well and are not jealous of him and are learning from him  Mr  Picardi grew up in North Andover  Mass  His father  a devout Catholic  owned a technology company  His mother was a homemaker and an executive assistant  He had four siblings  including a sister who used to paint his nails pink and a brother named John Paul  after the pope  Family dinners sometimes included Mr  Picardi s grandmother  who moved to America from a mountain village in Italy  My dad used to pick the sausages out of the sauce and eat them with his fingers  and my mom would cry   Mr  Picardi said It made for a sometimes challenging environment for the young Mr  Picardi   I was gay   he said   G A Y   with an exclamation mark and a little asterisk  He came out to his parents in the summer before ninth grade  It was 2 in the morning  and Mr  Picardi  who had just finished watching  Queer as Folk   burst into their bedroom and said   Mom  Dad  I have something to tell you   His mother sobbed as he said everything he had to say  Ten minutes later  his father rolled over and asked what was going on  He had slept through it His parents sent him to a Catholic therapist and instructed him not to tell his neighbors  his friends or his younger brother  But with his identity solidified  he began shaping his future  Before coming out  he had wanted to be a lawyer  Now  he decided  he should work in fashion  I watched  Will   Grace   and that s what it felt like they were doing  more or less   he said At a bookstore  he picked up copies of Out and Details  Then he saw it  Vogue  I picked up a copy of Vogue just because I was  like  I need to know about women s fashion now  because I m gay   he said   Jack and Will make fun of everything Grace wears on  Will   Grace   so I need to be like that  He helped start a charity fashion show at his high school  Central Catholic High School  called Catwalk4Cancer  which has since raised more than  250 000  He had the ability to make people do what he wanted them to do   said Carmen Lonero  a teacher who served as his adviser on the project   I always knew he was going to do something that was special  What set Mr  Picardi on a path toward working in magazines was a Vanity Fair cover story he read on Jennifer Aniston and the celebrity love triangle that involved Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt During his first week at N Y U   Mr  Picardi attended New York Fashion Week  covering an Alexandre Herchcovitch show for the shopping and style website Racked  Some months later  he had the internship at teenvogue com  He became a beauty intern after writing a blog post   BrowBeat  Confessions of an Over Tweezed Teen   about his eyebrows  following a painful experience with online bullying  He graduated a year early and became the head of Teen Vogue s website at 23 His duties have been expanded as Condé Nast is facing the financial challenges brought about by dwindling print circulations and listless ad sales  No longer a workplace of editors with plenty of leisure time and endless expense accounts  the company is surrendering to the economic realities and staccato rhythms of digital journalism Radhika Jones  a former books editor at The New York Times  replaced Graydon Carter as the editor of Vanity Fair  which has laid off a number of senior staff members who had worked under him  Samantha Barry  a former executive producer at CNN  has taken over Glamour from another veteran editor  Cynthia Leive  In addition to closing Teen Vogue s print edition  Condé Nast has reduced the print frequency of titles including GQ  Architectural Digest  W and Allure In this more parsimonious age  Mr  Picardi has emerged as the face of what Condé Nast calls its Next Gen network  which includes online titles like The Hive and Healthyish Until recently  another rising star at the company was Ms  Welteroth  who was named the editor in chief of Teen Vogue in April  Not long after the announcement  Ms  Wintour asked Mr  Picardi to lunch  Over salmon  in a conference room in the building  she asked him what he wanted to do long term  I had a very pretty clear idea in my mind how he was going to answer  but I wanted it  obviously  to come from him   Ms  Wintour said Mr  Picardi was not surprised by the question   I was ready for something new   he said   And I think she just sensed it  He pitched her the idea for what would become Them Ms  Wintour was interested  As the magazine business contracts  Condé Nast has been betting on less expensive  digital projects  and Them could serve as a template  It was a no brainer   Ms  Wintour said   It just seemed like  yeah  this is right  This is what Condé Nast should be doing  For anyone at the company or in the fashion world who had missed it  the bond between the Condé Nast artistic director and her new protégé became all too clear in June at the annual Council of Fashion Designers of America awards dinner  Seated at Ms  Wintour s table in the Hammerstein Ballroom  along with Nicole Kidman  Tory Burch and Huma Abedin  and wearing a Bally summerweight suit the color of rosé  was Mr  Picardi In November  Ms  Wintour stood at Mr  Picardi s side at a Condé Nast party held in honor of Them at Mission Chinese Food  a hip restaurant on Manhattan s Lower East Side  Among the guests were Chelsea Manning and Rose McGowan The L G B T  centric platform is so new that it is hard to tell how it will fare  In its first three months  it attracted fewer than 1 5 million total unique visitors  according to internal data  Teen Vogue  though still enjoying its run as an online voice for progressive politics  has been unable to sustain its momentum  In the last three months of 2017  it drew on average fewer than six million monthly unique visitors Mr  Picardi said he was unfazed   I think uniques are less and less a standard bearer of success   he said  His plans for Teen Vogue include a restructuring that would have one team devoted to the latest news and another focused on features  He also said he would like to turn last year s outrage into action But if Mr  Picardi s rise owes something to identity politics  the same line of thinking can be used against him  A recent Daily Beast article  for instance  questioned whether he was the right person to run Teen Vogue  By quietly installing a white man at its helm  Teen Vogue  a platform seeking to empower young intersectional feminists  has arguably taken a step backwards   the author argued    I think whoever wrote that is not looking at the person   Ms  Wintour said  Mr  Picardi s flair for riding a cultural wave continues to win him key fans in the building   I think there s no end to his potential   Robert A  Sauerberg Jr   Condé Nast s chief executive  said   He s innovative  he knows the marketplace  he knows young people  he knows all ages  he s not afraid  he s courageous  he s a brand builder  he s a culture driver  And it s just in his bones   it s not like you trained him  It s just there  When I asked Ms  Wintour if she thought Mr  Picardi could one day run Condé Nast  she did not swat away the question   For Phill  anything is possible   she said   It s his road to take  
Good Friday  Here s what we re watching today   Is Lloyd Blankfein  the chairman and chief executive of Goldman Sachs  planning on stepping down   The list of those hoping Broadcom fails in its pursuit of Qualcomm keeps growing   When will wage growth pick up   Senator Elizabeth Warren has some questions for Apollo and Citi   How much is Martin Shkreli s Wu Tang album worth   The Trump tariffs have many exceptions  Don t already get this in your inbox each morning  Sign up here The Wall Street Journal reported that Lloyd Blankfein  the chairman and chief executive of Goldman Sachs  will step down  as soon as the end of the year   citing anonymous sources But some important context is necessary  Neither Mr  Blankfein nor the board has set a timeline for him to step down  people briefed on the matter said  Mr  Blankfein has not discussed the possibility of leaving at the end of the year  these people said  though there is a general view that he likely would retire in the next couple of years  And it is very possible that this story may force Mr  Blankfein to move faster to explicitly lay out a timeline than he had originally planned Is it possible that Mr  Blankfein would step down at the end of 2018 Sure  It is absolutely a possibility  these people said  But it is hardly a certainty  And it is also a possibility that he could step down as C E O  but remain chairman  the people said Is it possible that he could still be at Goldman for part or all of 2019 Sure  these people said  But that s not a certainty either Is it possible he is at Goldman in 2020  That s less likely  these people agree  Goldman s board has held discussions about who should succeed Mr  Blankfein ever since Gary Cohn left the firm at the end of 2016  these people said  The board has designated Harvey Schwartz and David Solomon as likely successors  but has not set a specific date for when they need to decide on who will take the reins  these people said  Both men have privately been making plans to take over  these people said   Andrew Ross SorkinHere s Mr  Blankfein s response to the WSJ story The order President Trump signed on Thursday imposing tariffs on imported steel and aluminum provided him with wiggle room to exempt countries down the road In fact  even before signing the order  he suggested the possibility of later excluding allies like Australia Well  that seems like more of possibility now Late Friday President Trump said he is working with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull on an agreement so Australia will not be subject to the tariffs The Wall Street Journal reports that Intel  is considering a range of acquisition alternatives in reaction to Broadcom s hostile pursuit for Qualcomm  Those options include a possible bid for Broadcom  the WSJ reports citing anonymous sources Shares of Broadcom jumped 5 percent after hours Details from the WSJ  Intel is worried about the competitive threat a combined Broadcom Qualcomm would pose   Intel has been weighing its options since late last year and has engaged advisers   Intel might make a bid if Broadcom looks likely to succeed in its pursuit of Qualcomm Caveats  Any move from Intel is far from certain and one of WSJ s sources said it is unlikely ContextWashington isn t so sure a merger of Broadcom and Qualcomm is a good idea  The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States  the government panel that reviews transactions  national security implications  moved to stall the potential takeover of QualcommThe panel s intervention put Broadcom s bid in jeopardy  In practice  reviews by Cfius often lead to the demise of deals The February jobs report is in  The number of jobs added was the strongest in two years  but wage growth remained lackluster Here are the numbers   313 000 jobs were added last month  the most since October 2015  Economists had anticipated a gain of about 200 000   With revisions to previous months  the three month average job growth was 242 000 a month   The unemployment rate was 4 1 percent  the same as in January   The average hourly wage grew by 0 1 percent  It grew by 0 3 percent in January  The year over year increase fell to 2 6 percent from 2 9 percent   The labor force grew by 806 000  pushing the labor force participation rate back up to the 63 percent mark ContextA leap in job gains in February clears the way for the Federal Reserve to raise the benchmark interest rate when it meets this month The wage figures were disappointing  The jump in hourly earnings in January   which pushed the year over year figure to 2 9 percent  from 2 3 percent just three months earlier   was cited as a cause of a market sell off  With February s puny growth of 0 1 percent  the year over year increase dropped to 2 6 percent Investors could not have asked for much more from Friday s jobs report  The numbers for February show the United States economy was able to add a surprisingly large number of new jobs without creating the sort of surge in wages that can prompt investors to worry about inflation The 10 year Treasury note  which might have sold off on inflation fears  barely budged when the report came out  Futures markets pointed to higher opens for stock markets The economy created 313 000 jobs in February  the most since October 2015  Wages rose 2 6 percent from a year earlier  below the 2 9 percent rate for January that stoked inflation concerns In theory  as employers add large numbers of new employees  the competition to hire workers should drive wages much higher  Why is that not happening right now  It seems a large number of people who previously weren t looking for jobs are now entering the work force  That  in part  explains the 800 000 person increase in the labor force But investors will no doubt find something to fret about  Some may decide that the growth in employment is so strong that it won t be long before wage pressures build up  The amount of slack in the labor force is unknown  so investors shouldn t rely on it to dampen wage growth indefinitely  according to this view   Peter EavisIt s the unknown that torments investors every time the jobs report comes out Maybe we can shed some light As Friday s jobs report showed  the economy is adding large a numbers of jobs without stoking the sort of surge in wages that makes investors worried about inflation  Investors favor these economic conditions because it reduces the chances that the Federal Reserve will have to raise interest rates more quickly than they expect But how long might wage growth remain moderate  Much depends on how much slack exists in the jobs market  The headline unemployment rate  at 4 1 percent  suggests there is very little But the unemployment rate does not count the people who aren t in the workforce   and who may now enter it  No one knows for sure how many of these people are really looking for a job at any one time  or might do so in the near future  But if there are a lot of them  companies will not struggle to find workers   and wage growth might remain tame  Conversely  if the number of prospective workers on the sideline is small  wage pressures could soon build up One way to get an idea of the size of this group of people is to look at the employment rate  which measures people with jobs as a percentage of the population  over 16 years old and excluding prisoners   At 60 4 percent in February  that rate is still well below the level it was at before the 2008 financial crisis  That would imply that there are still a lot of people who could enter the jobs market But our colleague Ben Casselman  who covers economics  has devised an adjusted employment rate that readers might find interesting How did you adjust the measurement of the employment rate   and why did you make your tweaks Let me start with the  why   The employment rate is great in that it avoids all the issues that bedevil the unemployment rate in terms of deciding who should  count  as unemployed  But the problem is that it s too broad  It includes a huge group of people who no one would expect to work  namely retirees  And that group is growing rapidly because baby boomers are aging  So if we want the employment rate to tell us anything meaningful about the state of the economy  we have to account for that big demographic trend in some way One easy way to do this is to look at the employment rate among so called  prime age  workers  those ages 25 to 54  That excludes both retirees and most college students  which means it filters out a lot of the demographic noise in the employment rate  The problem is  it filters out a lot of valuable information  too  Lots of 55 year olds work  And indeed  55 year olds are much more likely to work now than they were a generation ago My calculation  which borrows from an approach used by economists  and occasional Upshot contributor  Ernie Tedeschi  adjusts for demographic shifts by controlling for age and sex  It essentially asks   What would the employment rate look like today if the U S  population still had the same demographic profile as it did before the recession  What does your adjusted employment rate tell us about the jobs market right now By my calculation  the demographics adjusted employment rate was at 62 8 percent in February  which is almost exactly where it stood in December 2007  which was the first month of the recession  But it s still significantly below where we were in 2000  the last time the unemployment rate got this low Can we use your adjusted employment rate to get an idea of how much slack is left in the labor force Yes  but it doesn t give a definitive answer  What it tells us is that the employment rate has fully recovered from the recession  It doesn t necessarily mean that all the slack is gone Let me expand on that slightly  Between the peak of the dot com bubble in 2000 and the peak of the housing bubble in 2007  the age adjusted employment rate fell by about a percentage point  There are two reads on that  One is that the job market just never got as good in the mid 2000s as it did in 1999 and 2000  The other interpretation is that there has been a fundamental shift in the economy  and for some set of reasons   technology  globalization  video games   the share of Americans who are willing or able to work has fallen If you buy that second story  then the fact that the age adjusted employment rate is back to prerecession levels should tell you that we re basically at full employment today  The slack is gone  This is as good as it gets  But I would argue the last couple years should lead to significant skepticism about this kind of structural change thesis  The labor force has grown dramatically over the last few years  Job growth has continued unabated  Unemployment rates for marginalized groups such as black Americans have fallen sharply  And this has all happened in an environment where wage growth has been sluggish  which suggests that employers are able to attract workers without boosting pay  at least by much  All of that suggests that there are still people out there who are willing to work if opportunities become available  I don t know if we can get back to that 2000 employment level  but today s report suggests we can at least keep moving in that direction   Joseph Song and Michelle Meyer  BofA Merrill Lynch  Today s  Goldilocks  report suggests the business cycle still has another leg to go  the labor supply is increasing to meet the gain aggregate demand  preventing price pressures from building too aggressively   Ellen Zentner  Morgan Stanley  Straight lines don t exist in economics  Despite the move lower in the year over year pace of average hourly earnings  AHE   the underlying trend in wage growth continues to firm  in line with continued tightening in the labor market and rising productivity   Joe Brusuelas  RSM US   The job market continues to sizzle as the economy is in the early stages of absorbing a late cycle fiscal boost that will support a growth rate well above the long term trend in 2018  The 313 000 job gain is more than triple that necessary to meet the demand of new entrants into the work force  which if it sustained will continue to put downward pressure on the unemployment rate  This will not be lost among an F O M C  that leans hawkish in 2018 and points toward an increasing probability that the central bank will hike rates four times this year  How strong is this labor market  The increase of 806 000 in the labor force and 785 000 in the household employment estimate are robust and statistically significant  which is a rare two for in the monthly labor report  This labor market is on fire and wage gains are in train    James Ingram  MB Capital   February s fall in average wage rise data takes some of the pressure off  But the creation of more than 300 000 jobs in February suggests it will return in the months to come  Throw in a potential trade war between the US and the EU and the US economy could be headed for a perfect inflationary storm later this year  An interest rate hike in March from the US Fed must now be all but nailed on    Capital Economics   We suspected that the flu epidemic and the unseasonably cold weather in January had depressed payrolls  but even we were caught out by the strength  Illness and weather also affected the earnings and

Starting at noon on Feb  23  the town of Arlee  Mont   evacuated  Most of its 600 odd residents drove 70 miles south through Missoula and then into the Bitterroot Valley  a river corridor full of subdivisions  trailers  exclusive private communities and ammunition stores  The crowd filtered into the gymnasium at Hamilton High School  wearing red shirts and pins bearing the faces of the Arlee Warriors basketball team  who that evening would be playing the Manhattan Christian Eagles Manhattan Christian is a faith based private school near Bozeman  Arlee is a public school on the Flathead Indian Reservation  about half the town is Salish  descendants of the people forced out of the Bitterroot in the 19th century  Manhattan Christian s boys were tall and muscled  most of Arlee s players were well under six feet and on the thinner side  Manhattan Christian arrived in a sleek black bus with aerodynamic curvature and tinted windows  Arlee came in a yellow Blue Bird  The Feb  23 game would be a rematch of the previous year s Class C state championship  which the Warriors won  On one wall of the gym  Manhattan Christian had hung a banner reading   unfinished   Arlee had their own banner  but they did not need it  They had Phillip Malatare Phil is 18 and six feet tall  He claimed to be 167 pounds  but that seemed generous  His normally angular face was especially gaunt that afternoon  a result of a nasty cold  But he had a reputation in the state  for his routine triple doubles  his no look passes thrown around his back at a dead sprint  his unguardable pull up jump shot  the speed and body control that made it all possible  His parents  John and Becky  arrived at 9 a m  to watch the day s earlier games and to stake out seats  The Malatares never sat together at games   It just works better   Becky said   I like to kind of breathe   John wore a red T shirt adorned with a Salish phrase that translates as  I m proud of my warriors  Ten minutes remained before warm ups  Normally  at this point  the boys would be making fart jokes or talking about video games  Now  though  the Warriors left the locker room and gathered in a hallway  A cameraman lined the players up  They were silent  The light on the camera blinked  and Phil spoke  We  the Arlee Warriors   he said   are dedicating this divisional tournament to all the families that have lost a loved one due to   um    He tripped up  and the cameraman asked for another take  We  the Arlee Warriors   he said   are dedicating this divisional tournament to all the families that have lost a loved one due to the pro   due to the pressures   Phil tried again   We  the Arlee Warriors  are dedicating this divisional tournament to all the families that have fallen victim to the loss of a loved one due to the pressures of life   We want you all to know   said Greg Whitesell  one of Phil s co captains   that you will be in our hearts and in our prayers as we step onto the floor to represent our school  community and our reservation  Lane Johnson  the power forward  spoke   As a team  we rely on each other to get through the challenges on the court or in life   Then Isaac Fisher  the 6 foot 9 center  said   To all the youth on the Flathead reservation  we want you to know that we stand together with you  Darshan Bolen  the sixth man and Phil s cousin and foster brother  said   Remember  you are the future   Phil wrote that line  Then Will Mesteth  a co captain and the team s only other senior  closed it   Please help us share this message and join our team as we battle against suicide  Only about half the Warriors could legally drive  and many struggled academically  But as state champions  they were kings on the Flathead reservation  They came into the season hoping to defend their trophy  Phil and Will also wanted a chance to play in college  But by the evening of the Manhattan Christian game  the season had transformed into something else entirely The videographer turned off his camera  and the Warriors retreated into the locker room  The boys could hear the gym rippling with noise  Then the drumming started Highway 93 connects Missoula  a booming college town  with Polson  on the south shore of Flathead Lake  Driving north out of Missoula  you pass a few gas stations  then wind through tight timber  A large casino emerges on the left  and then  just north of an overpass for migrating wildlife  the land yawns open to reveal a spectacular landscape  A timbered ridge rises to the east  out of which flows the Jocko River  fat with snowmelt in the spring  The highway curves through ranchland  then briefly splits to accommodate Arlee s five block downtown  Tourists who stop at the charming huckleberry themed restaurant or the coffee shop and art gallery don t always realize they re guests of a sovereign nation  the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes  One mile later  Arlee is gone The town is named for a Salish subchief  In 1871  Arlee  a Nez Percé by birth  acquiesced to the U S  government s demands that the Bitterroot Salish relocate  This put him at odds with the head Salish chief  Charlo  who stayed in the Bitterroot Valley until 1891  when he marched north under military escort  Embittered  he had called Arlee  that renegade Nez Percé   On the reservation  the Salish were forced together with the Pend d Oreille  their historical allies  and the Kootenai  a northern tribe with a different language  Government officials assigned them Anglicized names  and in 1909 Congress passed legislation opening the reservation to settlers  Many tribal members sold their allotted land  and Chief Charlo died in 1910  Native youth were forced into a Catholic boarding school  where nuns told the children that the devil was in them  The town of Charlo  30 miles from Arlee  is now almost entirely white  Arlee is not  The town s most popular gathering places are Wilson s  a grocery store  a community center full of basketball courts  and the gleaming gymnasium that looms over the one story public high school Because of its size  Arlee competes in Class C  the division representing Montana s smallest schools  most of them in mining and ranching towns or communities in Indian Country  The state s seven reservations   home to members of the Salish  Pend d Oreille  Kootenai  Blackfeet  Gros Ventre  Sioux  Crow  Northern Cheyenne  Assiniboine and Chippewa Cree tribes   share a deep passion for basketball  In 1904  just 13 years after James Naismith invented the game  a team of Native girls at a boarding school near Great Falls competed in a tournament at the World s Fair in St  Louis and were proclaimed world champions  In 1936  a team from the Fort Peck Reservation won a state high school championship  its stars  three brothers  went on to anchor a group that beat the Harlem Globetrotters  Indian ball   as it became known  was characterized by full court press defense and high scoring  improvisational fast breaks  The game is predicated on speed and cooperation   It s not very individualized   says Don Wetzel Jr   a Blackfeet Nation descendant who manages the Montana Indian Athletic Hall of Fame   You re not taught to be like that  To make your people happy is one of the greatest things you can ever do   High school stars from the past remain celebrated today  Names like Jonathan Takes Enemy  Sharon LaForge  Elvis Old Bull  Malia Kipp and Mike Chavez remind people of on court triumphs and  in many cases  off court trials Montana s best known reservation teams have come from the plains east of the Rocky Mountains  from Lodge Grass  on Crow Nation  and from Browning and Heart Butte  on Blackfeet Nation  But for the past decade  the basketball program in Arlee  which is in the foothills of the Mission Range  has touched the hem of this elite  In 2005  a group of parents  including John and Becky Malatare  started a youth basketball clinic  Between 2009 and 2013  Arlee s boys went 88 34  the girls went 105 39 between 2011 and 2016  During that time  both teams secured divisional titles but fell short at the state level  Zanen Pitts  a 32 year old rancher and Pend d Oreille first descendant  took over as the boys  coach in 2013  He installed a system that combined the freewheeling speed of Indian ball with defensive strategies borrowed from college programs   There is a structure to our chaos   Pitts says In 2014  Phil Malatare entered high school  He had dedicated most of his young life to two pursuits  horn hunting   searching for the freshly shed antlers of bull elk   and playing basketball at the community center  His arrival turned the Warriors  defense into something terrifying  During his freshman year  the team lost in the state semifinals  during his sophomore year  they reached the championship  last year  they went 25 1  and Phil played nearly every minute of the championship run  Just before the end of the game  someone in the crowd called him a redskin  Then  in the final seconds  he jumped for a rebound that clinched the victory  In his bedroom  he hung news clippings of his victories and defeats  for motivation  along with the cleaned skull of a buffalo he killed After last year  Phil was the only Class C player named to the ALL USA Montana Boys Basketball team  This fall  when The Great Falls Tribune previewed the state s best high school players  it listed Phil first  Watching Phil on the court  Wetzel got to thinking about Old Bull and Takes Enemy  each of whom he played against   He s more like Elvis   he says   Elvis was deceptively quick  Phillip is flat out quick   Don Holst  a former head coach for the University of Montana and a principal of Arlee s elementary school  saw it differently  Old Bull was a shooter  Phil  he says  has  this innate ability to see things   Pitts earnestly compared him to the N B A  star Russell Westbrook   I like Russell s pull up jumper a little better   he once said  Whenever Phil arrived at basketball camps  kids flocked to him  At one game  his father heard a boy scream   Phillip Malatare touched me  John Malatare  a Salish and Cree wildland firefighter  wanted Phil to cash in his ticket to leave the reservation while it was still good   A lot of these colleges in Montana   John says   will give a Native kid one chance   On reservations  basketball stars become symbols of hope  but many have struggled to replicate their high school success in college  Wetzel played at Montana State University at Billings  but he left the team after having a child in his sophomore year  He went on to a career in public education  Not everyone has been so fortunate  In 1991  Sports Illustrated s Gary Smith wrote about the Crow stars Takes Enemy and Old Bull  who both struggled with alcohol  Others have gone to college  only to leave after feeling homesick Pitts says that in five years as head coach  he has had three college coaches ask if prospects are Native  openly worrying that they might not last in school  Women from Montana s reservations have carried a similar weight  In 1992  Malia Kipp  from Blackfeet Nation  entered the University of Montana  starring with the Lady Grizzlies for all four years   I felt if I didn t succeed   she once said   others wouldn t get the opportunity  According to Pitts and Wetzel  the skepticism Native recruits face is owed to cultural misunderstanding  and the inadequate support systems in place as a result   Those coaches need to do a better job of sustaining  em   Pitts says   They need to understand what they re coaching   That meant recognizing the gravitational pull of home for players from reservations  but also the genuinely distinct sports culture incubated there  Kids who grow up playing Indian ball on the reservation  whether or not they are themselves Native   the Arlee Warriors are Salish  Navajo  Sioux  Pend d Oreille and Blackfeet  but also white  black and Filipino   can find the college game as alienating as campus life  For Wetzel  the businesslike nature and slower pace of college ball was challenging   It s conformity   he says  Wetzel thinks schools should recruit multiple reservation players at once  the way the Lady Grizzlies did a decade ago  following Kipp s success   I rarely see two Natives on the court at the same time at a college level   Wetzel says   It does bring some magic  Pitts  for his part  just wanted his players to get the opportunities they deserved  That meant a lot was riding on Phil  A good student with a supportive family  he was covered by local newspapers with headlines like unstoppable  Pitts thought he had been touched by God  Sometimes he found himself pleading with him to thrive in college   You re doing this for every kid in the world   he says   that s ever looked up to a basketball player coming off the rez  On Nov  15  the evening before the season s first practice  13 boys sat anxiously in a small classroom in Arlee s gym  It was 5 p m  and already dark outside  signaling the beginning of western Montana s long winter  Coach Pitts stood at the front of the room in baggy jeans  a baseball cap covering his sandy hair  dried manure on his boots  We re here for a purpose   Pitts said   That purpose is to win a state championship  I m going to chew on you  I m going to break you down  I m going to build you back up   He said he was going to change their lives   This is so much bigger than you   He outlined the rules  Guys who disrespected teachers would not play  Guys whose parents complained about court time would not play  Latecomers would not play  Exceptions would be made only in extreme circumstances   If you want to go hunting  you ve got some huge buck figured out  call me  Pitts cued up a highlight reel from last year s championship season and left the room  Will Mesteth often watched the tape at night  it made him feel all warm inside  But it just made Phil sad  because his two best friends had graduated  and he wanted another championship  He also wanted  desperately  to make it as a Division 1 college player When the tape finished  Phil walked to the front of the room in a camouflage hoodie and a backward hat   Everybody s going to be intimidated   he said   And we got to make them intimidated  And that is going to be how it s going to be  The first game of the season was on Dec  8  against a larger school from the Rocky Boy s Reservation  A couple of thousand fans filled the gym at a tribal college 40 miles north of Arlee  Will s hair was shining in a double braid courtesy of his mother  Phil was wired even though he had spent the morning deer hunting  We re not nervous   Pitts said  I m nervous   Phil said  His teammates appeared relieved On the mirror behind Pitts was a flier for a suicide prevention hotline  all but three of the tags on the bottom had been ripped off  He opened a box  revealing sleek  hooded warm up shirts  The boys  nerves melted away in a chorus of hollering  Pitts choreographed the team s entrance  instructing the boys to fan out onto the floor once Will s grandfather  father and uncles hit the drum and started the honor song   I want everyone to know   he said   The champs are here   The boys fell silent  and Pitts prayed Before the previous season s championship game against Manhattan Christian  David Whitesell  Arlee s superintendent  spent long hours considering what might follow a loss  In the event  Whitesell was planning to increase counseling both for the community and the team  It was a lot  he said   to place on the shoulders of a bunch of adolescent boys  The cause of his concern was a proliferation of suicides that had swept the Flathead reservation in recent months  It started in the fall of 2016  with a few teenagers  Then in the winter  just before the 2017 divisionals  the Malatares awoke to discover that a close friend had taken her own life   a woman Phil considered to be  like an auntie   and an aunt of Will s by blood Pitts and John Malatare told the boys that when people came to see the Warriors play  they briefly escaped their worries  But the suicides continued  they had become what public health professionals call a cluster  In April  a former Warrior who quit the team shot himself after attending the funeral of a friend who committed suicide  The former teammate survived  but Pitts was haunted   The adversary is so strong   he said   It s just there  Between November 2016 and November 2017  there were 20 deaths by suicide on the reservation  according to Anna Whiting Sorrell  an official with the tribal health department  Phil said he had known  a few  people who had died by suicide  Asked to clarify  he said   Twenty or thirty  In 2016  the Centers for Disease Control released a study examining suicide rates among Americans by race and ethnicity  In 2014  the last year for which the researchers compiled data  non Hispanic Native women between the ages of 15 and 24 committed suicide at a rate of 15 6 deaths per 100 000  or three times the rate of non Hispanic white women and five times the rate of non Hispanic black women of the same age  Young Native men had a rate of 38 2 deaths per 100 000 people  Among young people  the suicides often come in clusters  as happened in 2013 and 2014  on Arizona s Gila River Indian Reservation  in 2015  on South Dakota s Pine Ridge Indian Reservation  and last year  on the Flathead reservation  Some there  like Pitts  blamed technology  social media and bullying  Others looked to the boarding schools that removed a generation of children and created a cycle of abuse  Whiting Sorrell had come to think of suicide   along with alcoholism and drug abuse   as a symptom of intergenerational trauma  the inherited grief among indigenous communities resulting from colonization  Whitesell said that the community s kids needed to learn to  survive their past and their present  Part of that  he thought  was getting kids to talk openly about mental health  Upon taking the superintendent job in 2015  Whitesell sent the school staff to prevention training and had them take what s called an adverse childhood experiences  ACEs  quiz  a 10 question test to assess trauma  According to ACEs data the C D C  collected in 2010 from more than 53 000 people in 10 states and the District of Columbia  40 7 percent of participants reported no adverse childhood experiences  while 14 3 percent reported four or more  scores that were linked to increased health and behavioral risks   I scored a seven   Whitesell says  Many kids in Arlee  he says  would most likely register right around there  That trauma can manifest in many ways  Suicide  Whitesell says  was  an option  It can t be an option  In the fall  Whitesell s son Greg  the Warriors  co captain  got a concussion playing football  his fifth  and had to stay home from school for three weeks  He struggled to eat and felt depressed  That confused him  because he was a star and a state champion  He almost felt as if he had no right to be sad  and that just made it worse  Greg didn t hunt like Phil and Will  off the court  he loved video games and hanging out with his friends  Now Greg started to isolate himself and to sleep a lot   I was tired of being depressed   he says   You just get tired of everything  One night he sent a despairing text to a couple of friends  He was considering climbing out his window to start running when he saw headlights in the driveway  It was two teammates  Lane Schall  a gregarious ranch kid  and Darshan Bolen  Phil s cousin and foster brother  Greg told them he didn t want to live anymore Dar sat with him while Lane went to get Greg s mother  Raelena  She spoke with her son for about 45 minutes  then took Greg to a hospital in Missoula  where Whitesell met them   He and Raelena are divorced   Greg spent that night in a bare room with scratches on the wall   I felt like I didn t belong there   he says The hospital staff determined he wasn t an immediate risk and sent him home  For weeks Raelena woke up every couple of hours to check on her son  and Greg regularly saw a counselor  Then basketball season started  He kept his experience private until he learned that a younger teammate was battling depression  at which point he told the kid he had been through similar struggles  Lane and Dar never talked publicly about that night  But  Greg said later   if they didn t show up  I don t think I d be here now  In December  in a game against a team from Seeley Swan  Phil racked up 48 points  16 rebounds and nine assists in 24 minutes of play  Afterward  Adam Hiatt  the head coach from Montana Tech  a college in Butte that competes in the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics conference  texted Phil  hoping that he would enroll But Phil had other ideas  Sometimes he envisioned going to a powerhouse program like Oregon  but the idea of leaving Arlee caused an almost physical discomfort  He had been approached by a Division 1 school in Washington  and a small California school had offered him a full scholarship  but he brushed them off  The path to reconciling his athletic ambitions with his desire to stay close to home ran through Missoula  the college town just 24 miles south of Arlee  home of the Division 1 University of Montana Grizzlies  But the Griz had offered Phil only an invitation to walk on  meaning he d have to try out and pay his own way Tech  on the other hand  was offering a full scholarship  Phil was the team s No  1 recruit  Becky liked the idea  But Phil said he needed more time  and sure enough  soon a coach from the Griz reached out again   They re dangling that carrot   Becky said By Jan  9  the Warriors were 8 0 and had outscored their opponents by an average of more than 40 points per game  That evening they played Mission  a larger high school in St  Ignatius and a rival  just up Highway 93 from Arlee  In the stands  Becky sat next to Hiatt   He s the best player in the state   the coach said of Phil  John Malatare sat a couple of rows away  calling out traps Sitting with Hiatt  Becky digressed  as is her habit  talking about her son s dietary preferences    Phil doesn t eat salad  he eats chicken    and how he and John would leave in the middle of the night to hunt buffalo  That s crazy   Hiatt said But mostly Becky discussed Will Mesteth and how much Phil loved playing with him   They grew up together   she said  A few minutes later  Will carved his way to the basket   Will  No  3   Becky said suggestively   There he goes   And then  a few minutes later   No  3  his grandma is a Malatare  So they re related   But Will s shot was off  In the stands  his dad  Big Will  yelled   Get him the ball  Will s parents had him when they were in high school  and he was largely raised by his tupye  his great grandmother  Will got into powwows as a boy  singing and dancing  his grandfather gave him the claw of a black bear for protection  and he kept a collection of more than 20 pairs of Air Jordans  Will s mother  Chasity Haynes  is Salish and Navajo  and now works in the Salish and Kootenai Tribes  enrollment department  Big Will   no one calls him Will Sr    was a Sioux and Salish football star who went to play at the University of Montana but got kicked out before he played a game  Now he was a cop on the tribe s drug task force  Big Will desperately wanted his son to complete college  But Will s college prospects depended on the intensity of his defense and the accuracy of his three pointer Will struggled early in high school  compiling a string of F s and skipping class  sometimes to care for his tupye  But a teacher named Jennifer Jilot helped him  and he raised his grades enough to be academically eligible by his junior year  Then he made the all state team for Class C  He didn t say much  but when he spoke  teammates and opponents alike listened closely  When it came to basketball  Will said   pretty much everyone in the state knows who me and Phillip are   But in Jilot s classroom  Will curled up on her couch and hugged a pillow like a child  Jilot was deeply proud of his academic progress  She thought she might cry when he graduated Arlee beat Mission by 18 points  but in Pitts s and the other coaches  estimation  it was a lackluster night  the Warriors played selfishly  At the next practice  an assistant named Francis Brown Lonebear accused the boys of playing  Missoula ball   That was about as exciting as watching Flathead Lake freeze   I want to be gone   Brown Lonebear said   If you don t understand that  you don t understand about Indian ball  John Malatare sat in his friend T J  Haynes s truck  hurtling through the darkness  T J  wore a wool cap with elk teeth affixed to the brim  A tribal cop who worked with Big Will  he grew up with John  Now each was a foster parent  it was T J  s wife who committed suicide the previous February  before the state tournament  He was raising nine kids John and T J  had heard that buffalo were moving out of Yellowstone National Park  so they had loaded up T J  s trailer with snowmobiles and rolled south at 2 a m  In the 1870s  the Salish moved a few calves into the Flathead reservation  building up a herd that was later used to revive the flagging Yellowstone population  Now the Salish are one of six tribes with treaty rights allowing them to hunt Yellowstone s bison when they move out of the park On the ride down  the men rubbed their hands and whistled in anticipation  Sometimes the hunters just stood in line waiting for the bison to cross onto Forest Service land  and sometimes animal rights protesters tailed them  Even so  John would rather hunt buffalo than anything else   The first time I shot one of these  it was a whole different feeling   he said   It was just the respect   He and T J  talked about their disdain for trophy hunters who sell the hides   Phillip  he sleeps on his   John said   Got to keep the fan on just  cause he stays so warm  He considered his son s college prospects  He wanted Phil to get back to the Montana Tech coach  He knew Phil wanted to play for the Griz  but he didn t know what to do  Should he go knock down the coach s door and ask what it would take  He thought of a friend who had played college ball  The coach had given him a hard time   I said   They re testing you out     John recalled     They re seeing how tough your willpower really is     But his friend quit  John said   Proven point right there   Native kids got one shot A track star in high school  John always wished he had pursued athletics more seriously  Terry Pitts  Zanen s father  a retired coach and former tribal councilman  thought he could have been an Olympian  John met Becky  who was a descendant of European settlers and played basketball against his sisters  at age 22  Becky went on to work for a Missoula hospital  handling accounts  while John was hired by the Forest Service  digging breaks around wildfires  When he started out   We heard a lot of   What are you Indians doing here     he recalled   I had to work extra hard to prove that I could do the job   John became a supervisor  earning a good living  and when Phil was in sixth grade  four of his cousins  including Dar  came to live with the Malatares and their three children  After that the Malatares kept getting calls from the tribe  asking them to foster more kids  They came and came  sometimes for days at a time  sometimes more  Mounds of laundry piled up in the kitchen When Phil was 6  he told his parents he was going to be a professional athlete  By the time he was a freshman  he said he wanted to be the best basketball player Montana had ever seen  John realized he hadn t considered his own life once his son s career ended   What are we going to do if he doesn t continue and play through college   he asked   I don t know  I don t know if I ve thought that far  Dawn revealed a blue  snowed in landscape  T J  and John parked at a pull off  stepped out of the truck and fired up their snowmobiles  A wolf ran past  The men hopped on the sleds and tore off into the lodgepole  They wound up a long curving track to an overlook from which they could see wide plains and craggy peaks  but no buffalo  They descended into low timber and split up  T J  wound his way a bit farther  then stopped  A herd of bison moved slowly through the trees  followed by hunters on foot and  behind them  a group of animal rights campaigners documenting the kills  Shots rang out  and the herd split up  some moving toward private property  some back toward the park boundary An hour or so later  John and T J  met back at the truck  John hadn t caught the herd   Everyone without sleds killed  em   John said  Them protesters must have pushed  em all onto that private property   T J  said Over dinner that night at a sports bar  they joined a group of Salish hunters  who talked basketball and hunting and foster parenting  At one point  one of the men tried to imagine life with endless buffalo   Used to be a perfect world   he said  Sure ain t now   T J  said On the way home the next day  John considered the state championship in Butte  six weeks away  With seven games remaining in the regular season  the Warriors were undefeated  John had already booked his hotel room   Stars are going to have to start falling out of the skies   he said   for us not to be there  By early February  Phil was averaging 23 points  10 rebounds  seven assists and six steals a game  He needed to decide about Montana Tech  but he didn t have a clear feeling  Then one day he was driving out to one of his horn hunting spots  hoping to clear his head  when he received a text from a coach at the University of Montana  Phil called the coach right away  and the coach asked if he wanted a spot on the team  Phil pumped his fist and politely said that yes  he d like that very much  In a follow up call with Phil s parents  the Griz offered Phil a  preferred  walk on spot  meaning he was guaranteed a place on the team but would have to pay his own way  Phil told the coach he was in   Rachi Wortham  an assistant coach at the University of Montana  said   We can confirm recruitment   but he declined to comment further  After the call  John sat down in his leather recliner and exhaled  Becky was still partial to Tech   the school had great academics  and the free ride wouldn t hurt  given that the Malatares still had two more kids to put through high school and college  But Phil had made up his mind  He called Adam Hiatt to relay his decision  but he asked his parents not to share the news widely  He didn t want to disrupt the Warriors  playoff run The season came down to three weekends in late February and early March  the district championship  the divisional championship and state  By this point  Will had rediscovered his shot  and the Warriors played with devastating joy  In the last regular season game  Phil and Will combined to score 72 points Pitts called a coach from a Montana college  gushing that Will had a 35 foot shooting range  defense that can t be taught  strong grades  The coach wanted to know about Will s family  Pitts said that Will s father was a cop and that if the coach gave him a chance  his mother would  have him there tomorrow   Assuming his most authoritative sales voice  Pitts declared that Will would make it   I d stick my job on the line for him   The coach said he d think about it  Pitts hung up and shook his head On Tuesday  Feb  20  just before divisionals  word spread of a suicide  a teenage basketball player from Two Eagle River  a competing team on the Flathead reservation  Pitts was worried   The next week or two  another kid might do it   he said The divisional tournament was held in Hamilton  in the Bitterroot Valley  the ancestral homeland of the Salish  On the bus ride down before the first game  Pitts asked the players if they wanted to make a statement about the suicide  The boys thought it was a good idea and settled on a video as the way to do it  They decided that Phil would speak first and Will last  but when the camera rolled  Phil got nervous  One player didn t  Greg  His voice was calm and resolute   I was focused on helping these people   he later said   It felt awesome  In the locker room  after the camera turned off  Phil and Will coughed violently  After catching his cold  Phil had gone out to check some cows on a cousin s ranch in subzero temperatures earlier in the week  Will  meanwhile  had some as yet undiagnosed illness that had caused him to lose 25 pounds since the beginning of the season  In recent weeks  blood had showed up in his urine  He sought medical attention only after his mother  his coach and Pitts s wife  Kendra  an emergency medical technician  insisted   If you tell me I can t play   Will recalled telling a doctor   I m going to play  Will and Phil had carried two pillowcases into the locker room  In them were a pair of war bonnets adorned with golden eagle feathers  which Will s grandfather  who worked at the Salish language school  had made by hand  When the boys put on the bonnets  their teammates stared  Then Will s grandfather hit the drum and started the honor song  and the cousins sprinted onto the floor The Arlee crowd stood  everyone scrambling for their smartphones to capture the moment  Phil s grandparents  Bear and Irma  weren t sure about the bonnets  if a feather fell out  they might have had to do a ceremony on the court  But it was different for John  He hadn t always felt that his son had fully embraced Salish culture  Now  seeing Phil in the war bonnet  shaking the opposing coach s hand  he thought his heart might burst through his rib cage A couple of minutes into the game  Phil sprinted into the locker room  where he threw up  Then he checked back in  and the team ran an isolation play pitting Phil against Manhattan Christian s best player  Caleb Bellach  a 6 foot 5 junior and the coach s son  Phil dribbled between his legs three times as he approached Bellach  then feinted a hard crossover to the left but brought the ball back to the right and was gone  Another defender came to meet Phil  but he spun and jumped to his left  rising toward the rim with two hands  then pulled the ball down and scooped it to the right  His body moved one way but the ball went the other  The defender followed his body  and Phil softly laid the ball in At halftime  Arlee was up 39 30  and Phil threw up again  So did Will  In the third quarter  Manhattan closed the gap  Then  in the span of a minute  Will hit a three pointer  made a layup  stole the ball and threw an around the back pass to Greg for two points  at which point the crowd detonated  Arlee won  69 60  The announcer  a white man  marveled at the noise   You think this many people lived in Arlee   he chuckled  out of range of the microphone   Nobody s guarding the stores tonight  The next day  the Warriors released their suicide prevention video on Facebook  As the team warmed up before the divisional finals  Anna Whiting Sorrell  who helped oversee the tribe s response to the 2017 suicide cluster  was sitting in the stands  She considered the video in the context of the teenagers who  after the Parkland shooting  advocated gun control   Maybe   she said   it s kids saying  enough   She continued   Maybe these kids can  I want them to just be happy and enjoy their lives  They chose to engage  They ve all been there  They say enough  The team hoped a few thousand people might view their video  But within 24 hours  it had been watched nearly 86 000 times  On Monday  the team  inspired by the reception  skipped practice to make another  this one an elaborate production with alley oops and war bonnets  As they were finishing  a coach from Two Eagle River arrived in a black suit  He had come from the wake for the boy   his player   who committed suicide the week before divisionals   I just wanted to say thank you  guys   he said in halting breaths  His chest heaved  and he told the Warriors to bring home the trophy A long silence followed  Then someone asked   Can we hug him  Phil embraced the man  and everyone else followed  I m not scared one bit   Phil screamed  It was halftime of the state semifinal game  and the Warriors were losing by six to Scobey  a fast team from near the Canadian border  In the locker room  Phil coughed rapidly   I like it when we re down   he yelled   When we come back and beat their ass  that s going to be better   Then he threw up and took the court In the third quarter  Pitts unveiled a brutal press  The team s defense was designed to tire the opponent out until  all at once and in a great rush  the boys unleashed  With less than three minutes remaining in the quarter and Arlee losing by four  Pitts hopped up and down on the sideline and screamed  In a moment  the boys were everywhere  The next 60 seconds passed in a blur of steals and turnovers  Greg and Will each hit a long three pointer  the second giving Arlee its first lead  Then  as Scobey brought the ball up  Greg and Phil smacked the floor  Phil took off in a straight line for the ballhandler  who looked terrified  he ripped the ball away and flew off for a layup  He sprinted back down the court  beckoning to the crowd  The cheers sounded like the inside of a breaking wave In just over two minutes  Arlee had scored 14 unanswered points  After the game  Pitts teared up  thanking the boys  Then the Warriors watched Manhattan Christian win  setting up one last rematch  A couple of hours earlier  in a hallway of the Butte Civic Center  the father of one of Manhattan Christian s players said he just wanted everyone to have fun   It s not life   he said The following morning  Becky and John Malatare staked out their seats for the final by 11 a m   nine hours before tipoff  By game time  Senator Steve Daines  whose son previously attended Manhattan Christian  was in the crowd  Shortly before tipoff  Chasity did Will s hair by center court  Phil got an IV of fluids  his third of the week  Then he joined his teammates in a practice gym  where Pitts told the boys to enjoy the moment and prayed to God and the Creator  Then Phil spoke  It was a pretty short year  wasn t it   he said to his teammates in a dry  cracking voice  He turned to Lane Johnson  who would be guarding Bellach   Hound that guy   Then he turned to Isaac   Dunk it  Rip that rim off  Will  Greg  freaking rip that net off   He told them   Don t get down if we go down by two points  We ve been down  All right  boys  Come out  battle for me  Battle for Will  Battle for each other  Let s make that crowd happy  Now the long  slow cadence of Phil s voice changed  It got small and rushed  and he started to cry  Normally the team ended these huddles by chanting  brothers  and  family   Now  though  Phil said     Love you  on three   He counted   one  two  three   and his team chanted   Love you   Then Big Will and Will s grandfather and uncles hit the drum  and Phil and Will sprinted onto the floor in war bonnets  Greg trailing them in a Navajo headband  On the east side of the Civic Center  the town of Arlee rose as one Bear and Irma Malatare sat in the second deck  Nearby  David Whitesell held up a smartphone  filming the game  Down below  Becky  sitting near Adam Hiatt  looked on calmly  Chasity sat courtside with her five other kids  She knew Will was risking his health  but rest was not an option   It would kill him   Nearby  Will s tupye sat in a wheelchair  wearing a pin showing her great grandson s face  John Malatare s jaw rotated in small movements  a beaded Warriors medallion around his neck Manhattan Christian won the opening tipoff  and Bellach hit a three pointer  Then Phil threw a no look pass off Isaac s hands  Will missed a three and the game turned ugly  Phil missed his first five shots  Will made only one of four  At the end of the first quarter  Bellach blocked Phil s shot  and the game was tied at 10 In the second quarter  Will missed two more three pointers  and Manhattan s boys began to nod their heads  With a few seconds remaining in the first half  Phil dropped the ball to Will about 10 feet behind the three point line  Will eyeballed the waning clock and fired a wild shot toward the rafters  The ball ripped through the net  the buzzer sounded and Will pumped his fists and screamed  He made two more three pointers in the third quarter  and the score was 40 36 Arlee going into the fourth  Then Phil took over He rebounded a missed three pointer and bullied in for a layup  While nearly lying on the floor  he tossed the ball to Isaac for a basket  When Manhattan closed to within two  Phil drove  scored and was fouled  With a four point Arlee lead and less than one minute left  Phil whipped the ball to Isaac for another layup  But in the season s final moments  it was Will who stood at the free throw line  preparing for two shots to seal the state championship  In the stands  Jennifer Jilot whispered to Will   Just breathe   Twice the ball rolled through the net  and Jilot wept On Sunday  the Warriors returned to Arlee led by a fire truck and tribal police escort  Afterward  the team gathered on the bus to listen to an elder  She said that the kids would crash  and that a time would come when they would feel alone  She asked them to forgive themselves   It s temporary   she said   It s like the breeze  It will be gone  The next day most of the boys called in sick to school  The second prevention video was on its way to reaching one million views  Pitts started receiving congratulations from public officials  a call from the governor s office and letters from all three members of Montana s congressional delegation  Senator Jon Tester released a video saluting the Warriors  efforts alongside Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey  The team was arranging to speak with the Tribal Council and younger students at neighboring schools  Pitts called it  the Warrior movement  Becky Malatare received a gracious message from Manhattan Christian s coach  Jeff Bellach  thanking her for the opportunity to compete against Phil  On Wednesday  Will went to the hospital  where he discovered he had been playing with walking pneumonia and an enormous kidney stone  He elected to delay its removal until after three all star tournaments  College recruiters had reached out to him following the championship  and he needed one more push to get into school That night  Big Will went on a difficult call  He arrested one of the players from the previous year s championship  a freshman at the University of Montana  The police said the boy had been present at a shooting  and he would later be charged for accountability to attempted deliberate homicide  Big Will apologized to the boy s parents before driving him to Missoula One afternoon that week  Phil got his spotting scope and drove his red Chevy toward one of his horn hunting spots  a ridge from which gullies descended to a river  He pulled over and fastened his scope to the open passenger window  The snow was still deep up top  He scoped until he found a herd of about 100 elk   Can t hide forever   he said   I ll walk all this even if it don t melt  If I know they re dropping  I ll go in there   But the herd was mostly dark  cows  He was looking for the big  tawny bulls As he scanned the hills  Phil thought about this summer  He figured it would be his last as a kid  He planned to be starting for the Griz by the time he was a sophomore  He wondered about the temptations of college   After a big win  am I going to want to go be dumb   he asked  as if it were a question he couldn t possibly answer He thought about his father and T J   who could walk these hills for a full day without eating  Phil couldn t do that  He discoursed on the supremacy of brown antlers   which are fresh with blood   to white ones   White s old  brown s new   he said   Put it this way  You rather have a Lamborghini or a Subaru  A Subaru  I said  But if you lived in California  Phil didn t want to live in California   Everyone s like  Oh  you need to get out of here     he said   Which I believe  But if you love where you live  why not live there  No use movin   Once I asked him about the pressure of making it with the Griz  He said that he was  all in   but that if it didn t work out  that would be O K   It s my life   he said  What did that mean  anyway  to make it  Was it a jersey entombed in glass  Phil couldn t take that with him when he died  He was going to play ball as long as he could  but when it ended  he wanted to be a game warden  like T J  s father  Tom Haynes  so he could work in the mountains As chance would have it  Tom drove by just then  Maybe he was out busting someone for illegal firewood cutting  Phil went back to scoping  he had found three bulls bedded down in the snow  He was hoping one would drop its antlers right there   That s my dream   he said   to see one shed through the lens of his scope  It had never happened   Come on  guy   he said to the elk   Lose your horns   His right eye affixed to the scope  the boy in constant motion was absolutely still  Only his left eyelid fluttered   I wish I could sit here all day   he said  He stared into the wilderness  wondering what would happen On Sunday  March 11  Arlee hosted a syulm  a dance celebrating warriors returning from a victorious battle  for the team  About 350 people showed up to the community center s basketball court  The gym smelled of turkey  fry bread  spaghetti and meatballs  Irma and Bear Malatare arrived early  Irma was thinking of buying a 15 passenger van so she could take the whole family to Phil s college games  She went inside while Bear stood out front in an Arlee Warriors state championship jacket  long arms dangling at his sides Bear had been reading a history of the Cree  He normally didn t dwell on the past  He never told Phil about his time at the boarding school  when teachers beat him for speaking his language   We can t constantly sit and cry about what they done to us   he once said  But the book made him think about his grandparents  migration from Canada  and his own father  for whom Phil was named  and his time with the nuns  the constant efforts at assimilation and extermination  We re not supposed to be here   he said  his face turning momentarily dark  his immense hands clenching  Then his hands released  and a great smile worked its way across his face   We re still here   he said He walked inside  where mothers danced around the laughing boys  shoving them playfully down to the court  The world is never so hopeful as when the old honor the young
