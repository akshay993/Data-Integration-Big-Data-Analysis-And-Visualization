 After this story was published  Facebook came under harsh criticism from lawmakers in the United States and Britain  Read the latest  LONDON   As the upstart voter profiling company Cambridge Analytica prepared to wade into the 2014 American midterm elections  it had a problem The firm had secured a  15 million investment from Robert Mercer  the wealthy Republican donor  and wooed his political adviser  Stephen K  Bannon  with the promise of tools that could identify the personalities of American voters and influence their behavior  But it did not have the data to make its new products work So the firm harvested private information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users without their permission  according to former Cambridge employees  associates and documents  making it one of the largest data leaks in the social network s history  The breach allowed the company to exploit the private social media activity of a huge swath of the American electorate  developing techniques that underpinned its work on President Trump s campaign in 2016 An examination by The New York Times and The Observer of London reveals how Cambridge Analytica s drive to bring to market a potentially powerful new weapon put the firm   and wealthy conservative investors seeking to reshape politics   under scrutiny from investigators and lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic Christopher Wylie  who helped found Cambridge and worked there until late 2014  said of its leaders   Rules don t matter for them  For them  this is a war  and it s all fair   They want to fight a culture war in America   he added   Cambridge Analytica was supposed to be the arsenal of weapons to fight that culture war  Details of Cambridge s acquisition and use of Facebook data have surfaced in several accounts since the business began working on the 2016 campaign  setting off a furious debate about the merits of the firm s so called psychographic modeling techniques But the full scale of the data leak involving Americans has not been previously disclosed   and Facebook  until now  has not acknowledged it  Interviews with a half dozen former employees and contractors  and a review of the firm s emails and documents  have revealed that Cambridge not only relied on the private Facebook data but still possesses most or all of the trove Cambridge paid to acquire the personal information through an outside researcher who  Facebook says  claimed to be collecting it for academic purposes During a week of inquiries from The Times  Facebook downplayed the scope of the leak and questioned whether any of the data still remained out of its control  But on Friday  the company posted a statement expressing alarm and promising to take action  This was a scam   and a fraud   Paul Grewal  a vice president and deputy general counsel at the social network  said in a statement to The Times earlier on Friday  He added that the company was suspending Cambridge Analytica  Mr  Wylie and the researcher  Aleksandr Kogan  a Russian American academic  from Facebook   We will take whatever steps are required to see that the data in question is deleted once and for all   and take action against all offending parties   Mr  Grewal said Alexander Nix  the chief executive of Cambridge Analytica  and other officials had repeatedly denied obtaining or using Facebook data  most recently during a parliamentary hearing last month  But in a statement to The Times  the company acknowledged that it had acquired the data  though it blamed Mr  Kogan for violating Facebook s rules and said it had deleted the information as soon as it learned of the problem two years ago In Britain  Cambridge Analytica is facing intertwined investigations by Parliament and government regulators into allegations that it performed illegal work on the  Brexit  campaign  The country has strict privacy laws  and its information commissioner announced on Saturday that she was looking into whether the Facebook data was  illegally acquired and used  In the United States  Mr  Mercer s daughter  Rebekah  a board member  Mr  Bannon and Mr  Nix received warnings from their lawyer that it was illegal to employ foreigners in political campaigns  according to company documents and former employees Congressional investigators have questioned Mr  Nix about the company s role in the Trump campaign  And the Justice Department s special counsel  Robert S  Mueller III  has  demanded the emails of Cambridge Analytica employees who worked for the Trump team as part of his investigation into Russian interference in the election While the substance of Mr  Mueller s interest is a closely guarded secret  documents viewed by The Times indicate that the firm s British affiliate claims to have worked in Russia and Ukraine  And the WikiLeaks founder  Julian Assange  disclosed in October that Mr  Nix had reached out to him during the campaign in hopes of obtaining private emails belonging to Mr  Trump s Democratic opponent  Hillary Clinton The documents also raise new questions about Facebook  which is already grappling with intense criticism over the spread of Russian propaganda and fake news  The data Cambridge collected from profiles  a portion of which was viewed by The Times  included details on users  identities  friend networks and  likes   Only a tiny fraction of the users had agreed to release their information to a third party  Protecting people s information is at the heart of everything we do   Mr  Grewal said   No systems were infiltrated  and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked  Still  he added   it s a serious abuse of our rules  The Bordeaux flowed freely as Mr  Nix and several colleagues sat down for dinner at the Palace Hotel in Manhattan in late 2013  Mr  Wylie recalled in an interview  They had much to celebrate Mr  Nix  a brash salesman  led the small elections division at SCL Group  a political and defense contractor  He had spent much of the year trying to break into the lucrative new world of political data  recruiting Mr  Wylie  then a 24 year old political operative with ties to veterans of President Obama s campaigns  Mr  Wylie was interested in using inherent psychological traits to affect voters  behavior and had assembled a team of psychologists and data scientists  some of them affiliated with Cambridge University The group experimented abroad  including in the Caribbean and Africa  where privacy rules were lax or nonexistent and politicians employing SCL were happy to provide government held data  former employees said Then a chance meeting brought Mr  Nix into contact with Mr  Bannon  the Breitbart News firebrand who would later become a Trump campaign and White House adviser  and with Mr  Mercer  one of the richest men on earth Mr  Nix and his colleagues courted Mr  Mercer  who believed a sophisticated data company could make him a kingmaker in Republican politics  and his daughter Rebekah  who shared his conservative views  Mr  Bannon was intrigued by the possibility of using personality profiling to shift America s culture and rewire its politics  recalled Mr  Wylie and other former employees  who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had signed nondisclosure agreements  Mr  Bannon and the Mercers declined to comment Mr  Mercer agreed to help finance a  1 5 million pilot project to poll voters and test psychographic messaging in Virginia s gubernatorial race in November 2013  where the Republican attorney general  Ken Cuccinelli  ran against Terry McAuliffe  the Democratic fund raiser  Though Mr  Cuccinelli lost  Mr  Mercer committed to moving forward The Mercers wanted results quickly  and more business beckoned  In early 2014  the investor Toby Neugebauer and other wealthy conservatives were preparing to put tens of millions of dollars behind a presidential campaign for Senator Ted Cruz of Texas  work that Mr  Nix was eager to win When Mr  Wylie s colleagues failed to produce a memo explaining their work to Mr  Neugebauer  Mr  Nix castigated them over email  ITS 2 PAGES   4 hours work max  or an hour each   What have you all been doing    he wrote Mr  Wylie s team had a bigger problem  Building psychographic profiles on a national scale required data the company could not gather without huge expense  Traditional analytics firms used voting records and consumer purchase histories to try to predict political beliefs and voting behavior But those kinds of records were useless for figuring out whether a particular voter was  say  a neurotic introvert  a religious extrovert  a fair minded liberal or a fan of the occult  Those were among the psychological traits the firm claimed would provide a uniquely powerful means of designing political messages Mr  Wylie found a solution at Cambridge University s Psychometrics Centre  Researchers there had developed a technique to map personality traits based on what people had liked on Facebook  The researchers paid users small sums to take a personality quiz and download an app  which would scrape some private information from their profiles and those of their friends  activity that Facebook permitted at the time  The approach  the scientists said  could reveal more about a person than their parents or romantic partners knew   a claim that has been disputed When the Psychometrics Centre declined to work with the firm  Mr  Wylie found someone who would  Dr  Kogan  who was then a psychology professor at the university and knew of the techniques  Dr  Kogan built his own app and in June 2014 began harvesting data for Cambridge Analytica  The business covered the costs   more than  800 000   and allowed him to keep a copy for his own research  according to company emails and financial records All he divulged to Facebook  and to users in fine print  was that he was collecting information for academic purposes  the social network said  It did not verify his claim  Dr  Kogan declined to provide details of what happened  citing nondisclosure agreements with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica  though he maintained that his program was  a very standard vanilla Facebook app  He ultimately provided over 50 million raw profiles to the firm  Mr  Wylie said  a number confirmed by a company email and a former colleague  Of those  roughly 30 million   a number previously reported by The Intercept   contained enough information  including places of residence  that the company could match users to other records and build psychographic profiles  Only about 270 000 users   those who participated in the survey   had consented to having their data harvested Mr  Wylie said the Facebook data was  the saving grace  that let his team deliver the models it had promised the Mercers  We wanted as much as we could get   he acknowledged   Where it came from  who said we could have it   we weren t really asking  Mr  Nix tells a different story  Appearing before a parliamentary committee last month  he described Dr  Kogan s contributions as  fruitless  Just as Dr  Kogan s efforts were getting underway  Mr  Mercer agreed to invest  15 million in a joint venture with SCL s elections division  The partners devised a convoluted corporate structure  forming a new American company  owned almost entirely by Mr  Mercer  with a license to the psychographics platform developed by Mr  Wylie s team  according to company documents  Mr  Bannon  who became a board member and investor  chose the name  Cambridge Analytica The firm was effectively a shell  According to the documents and former employees  any contracts won by Cambridge  originally incorporated in Delaware  would be serviced by London based SCL and overseen by Mr  Nix  a British citizen who held dual appointments at Cambridge Analytica and SCL  Most SCL employees and contractors were Canadian  like Mr  Wylie  or European But in July 2014  an American election lawyer advising the company  Laurence Levy  warned that the arrangement could violate laws limiting the involvement of foreign nationals in American elections In a memo to Mr  Bannon  Ms  Mercer and Mr  Nix  the lawyer  then at the firm Bracewell   Giuliani  warned that Mr  Nix would have to recuse himself  from substantive management  of any clients involved in United States elections  The data firm would also have to find American citizens or green card holders  Mr  Levy wrote   to manage the work and decision making functions  relative to campaign messaging and expenditures  In summer and fall 2014  Cambridge Analytica dived into the American midterm elections  mobilizing SCL contractors and employees around the country  Few Americans were involved in the work  which included polling  focus groups and message development for the John Bolton Super PAC  conservative groups in Colorado and the campaign of Senator Thom Tillis  the North Carolina Republican Cambridge Analytica  in its statement to The Times  said that all  personnel in strategic roles were U S  nationals or green card holders   Mr  Nix  never had any strategic or operational role  in an American election campaign  the company said Whether the company s American ventures violated election laws would depend on foreign employees  roles in each campaign  and on whether their work counted as strategic advice under Federal Election Commission rules Cambridge Analytica appears to have exhibited a similar pattern in the 2016 election cycle  when the company worked for the campaigns of Mr  Cruz and then Mr  Trump  While Cambridge hired more Americans to work on the races that year  most of its data scientists were citizens of the United Kingdom or other European countries  according to two former employees Under the guidance of Brad Parscale  Mr  Trump s digital director in 2016 and now the campaign manager for his 2020 re election effort  Cambridge performed a variety of services  former campaign officials said  That included designing target audiences for digital ads and fund raising appeals  modeling voter turnout  buying  5 million in television ads and determining where Mr  Trump should travel to best drum up support Cambridge executives have offered conflicting accounts about the use of psychographic data on the campaign  Mr  Nix has said that the firm s profiles helped shape Mr  Trump s strategy   statements disputed by other campaign officials   but also that Cambridge did not have enough time to comprehensively model Trump voters In a BBC interview last December  Mr  Nix said that the Trump efforts drew on  legacy psychographics  built for the Cruz campaign By early 2015  Mr  Wylie and more than half his original team of about a dozen people had left the company  Most were liberal leaning  and had grown disenchanted with working on behalf of the hard right candidates the Mercer family favored Cambridge Analytica  in its statement  said that Mr  Wylie had left to start a rival firm  and that it later took legal action against him to enforce intellectual property claims  It characterized Mr  Wylie and other former  contractors  as engaging in  what is clearly a malicious attempt to hurt the company  Near the end of that year  a report in The Guardian revealed that Cambridge Analytica was using private Facebook data on the Cruz campaign  sending Facebook scrambling  In a statement at the time  Facebook promised that it was  carefully investigating this situation  and would require any company misusing its data to destroy it Facebook verified the leak and   without publicly acknowledging it   sought to secure the information  efforts that continued as recently as August 2016  That month  lawyers for the social network reached out to Cambridge Analytica contractors   This data was obtained and used without permission   said a letter that was obtained by the Times   It cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately  Mr  Grewal  the Facebook deputy general counsel  said in a statement that both Dr  Kogan and  SCL Group and Cambridge Analytica certified to us that they destroyed the data in question  But copies of the data still remain beyond Facebook s control  The Times viewed a set of raw data from the profiles Cambridge Analytica obtained While Mr  Nix has told lawmakers that the company does not have Facebook data  a former employee said that he had recently seen hundreds of gigabytes on Cambridge servers  and that the files were not encrypted Today  as Cambridge Analytica seeks to expand its business in the United States and overseas  Mr  Nix has mentioned some questionable practices  This January  in undercover footage filmed by Channel 4 News in Britain and viewed by The Times  he boasted of employing front companies and former spies on behalf of political clients around the world  and even suggested ways to entrap politicians in compromising situations All the scrutiny appears to have damaged Cambridge Analytica s political business  No American campaigns or  super PACs  have yet reported paying the company for work in the 2018 midterms  and it is unclear whether Cambridge will be asked to join Mr  Trump s re election campaign In the meantime  Mr  Nix is seeking to take psychographics to the commercial advertising market  He has repositioned himself as a guru for the digital ad age   a  Math Man   he puts it  In the United States last year  a former employee said  Cambridge pitched Mercedes Benz  MetLife and the brewer AB InBev  but has not signed them on 
Debates over privacy have plagued Facebook for years But the news that  Cambridge Analytica  a political data firm that worked on President Trump s 2016 campaign  was able to gain access to private data through the social network has sparked an unusually strong reaction among its users The hashtag  DeleteFacebook appeared more than 10 000 times on Twitter within a two hour period on Wednesday  according to the analytics service ExportTweet  On Tuesday  it was mentioned 40 398 times  according to the analytics service Digimind Cher was one such deserter  writing on Twitter that the decision to quit Facebook  although  very hard   was necessary because she loves the United States Brian Acton  a co founder of the WhatsApp messaging service  told his tens of thousands of followers on Tuesday to delete Facebook  The social network acquired WhatsApp in a  19 billion deal in 2014 For people who aren t celebrities or billionaires  the decision to abandon Facebook came reluctantly  because the platform often served as their sole connection to certain relatives  friends and professional opportunities Here  some newly Facebook free users of social media discuss why they left       Richard H  PerryA filmmaker in Los AngelesFor a long time now  Mr  Perry had wanted to leave Facebook He never felt comfortable knowing that the company had access to much of his personal information  In the months before the 2016 presidential election  he watched the social network become what he called  a garbage platform of ads and weird reposted articles and people that you care about exposing themselves as racists  But Facebook was also where Mr  Perry promoted his films  where he posted ads seeking help on the set  and where he communicated with colleagues and a  massive number  of his friends and relatives Until he heard about Cambridge Analytica  I suspected this stuff was going on  but this is the first time it s been plainly exposed   he said   It seems so malicious  and Facebook seems so complicit all the way up and down  like it doesn t care about its users  Mr  Perry  39  has since deleted his profile and plans to switch to Twitter and Instagram for his social media needs  It was an easy decision   he said   It s not going to be the end of the world        Dan ClarkA retired Navy veteran in MaineMr  Clark kept one Facebook account to chat with friends and a separate account to keep tabs on members of his family nationwide  This week  he deleted both  Facebook was the main platform I used to keep in touch with all of them  and it was a difficult decision to give it up   he said   But you have to stand for something  so I just put my foot down and said enough is enough  Mr  Clark  57  said he had already been angry with Facebook for censoring some of his posts  which he said expressed his staunchly conservative views but were  never evil or putting anybody down   He could not abide the idea that his personal information was also being sold or given away without his consent Before cutting the cord  Mr  Clark posted on Facebook inviting his contacts to ask him for his personal phone number  More than 100 people reached out within three days  There are just so many ways nowadays to stay in contact  phones  email  instant message  Gab  which is a social network that doesn t censor anything   he said   Facebook is more obsolete than people would think        Alexandra KleemanA writer on Staten IslandHer first experience with fake news   a Facebook post claiming that Pope Francis had endorsed Mr  Trump s candidacy   altered the way Ms  Kleeman looked at Facebook  It changed the psychological and emotional feel of the platform for me   she said   I don t have a great feeling when I log in  The Cambridge Analytica scandal led her to remove the Facebook app from her phone   I m not going to give them my engagement clicks   Ms  Kleeman  32  said  But she is keeping the messaging function open for professional purposes and will continue using Instagram She doesn t mind the idea that some personal data can be made public   she used to have a blog  she said  But the idea that my data could be used for purposes that I expressly don t want  that freaks me out        Paul MusgraveAn assistant professor in Amherst  Mass Twitter makes Mr  Musgrave feel depressed about the world  but Facebook is the social media platform he is trying to abandon As a political science teacher at the University of Massachusetts Amherst  Mr  Musgrave  36  feels a professional responsibility to keep abreast of the news and academic chatter hurtling at him in the form of tweets Facebook was more valuable to him as a  low key  offstage networking tool   a  replacement for end of year family newsletters  that allowed him to  passively keep up with people   he said  He joined the platform more than a decade ago and before that had been a member of Friendster  a precursor to Facebook But in 2016  while helping his mother during her campaign for a government position in Indiana  Mr  Musgrave discovered a  poisonous swamp  of content on the site  The Cambridge Analytica findings were even more disturbing  he said  This is a company that has Orwellian levels of data about us  truly Big Brother level  but it s behaving as if it has no social responsibility and is a purely neutral medium of communication   he said   That s what s really been scary  Having deactivated his Facebook account  with plans to delete it  he now worries about connecting with people who use the social network as their main conduit of communication  I m definitely pruning myself away from some of those really important branches   he said   I watch my own students try to navigate the world of apps and smartphones  and even they don t really know how the internet works outside these enclosed garden spaces        Ben GreenzweigAn entrepreneur in Westchester  N Y Once Mr  Greenzweig confirms that the 1 195 photos and 85 videos in his Facebook profile have downloaded  he plans to delete the account he has maintained for nearly a decade Mr  Greenzweig  40  said the Cambridge Analytica news was  the last straw   We have surpassed the tipping point  where the benefit now fails to outweigh the cost   he said   But I will definitely miss what the promise of Facebook used to be   a way to connect to community in a very global and local context  A year ago  Mr  Greenzweig was an  extraordinarily active  Facebook user who juggled conversations with friends  managed several groups  took out ads for his business and maintained professional contacts But on Tuesday night  in his final post  he asked his network to connect with him through email  LinkedIn  Twitter or phone  See everyone in the real world   he wrote

DUBLIN   As Ireland prepares to vote in May on a referendum on whether to repeal its ban on abortion  anti abortion campaigners can be seen rallying most weekdays on the streets of Dublin  outside Parliament  and at universities  news media buildings and the offices of human rights groups They arrive wearing body cameras and bearing placards with graphic images of aborted fetuses But not all of them are Irish Of the eight members of the anti abortion Irish Center for Bio Ethical Reform who protested outside the offices of The Irish Times on a recent weekday  only three   including the group s leader  Jean Engela   are Irish  The others include Americans and a Hungarian  We try to be as multinational as the abortion industry  and they make no apologies for sending in their international affiliates to pontificate to the Irish people   said Dr  Engela The protests   relatively small but highly visible here in the Irish capital   are an emblem of the strong emotions as the country prepares to vote in late May on whether to retain the Eighth Amendment of the Irish Constitution  which bans abortion in nearly all circumstances and was itself enacted by a referendum  in 1983   Abortion was illegal before 1983  but the amendment made it even harder to terminate a pregnancy  even to save to mother s life  To the age old debates around abortion   including questions of when life begins and of women s control over their reproductive rights   the referendum has added a new dimension of concern about potential outside interference in the vote An ethics regulator recently ordered two abortion rights groups  Amnesty International Ireland and the Abortion Rights Campaign  to return grants of  150 000 and  25 000 to George Soros s Open Society Foundations  It said the money was a foreign political donation intended to affect the outcome of a referendum or election  and therefore banned But so far it does not appear that any anti abortion groups have been asked to return overseas donations  despite reports that money is being openly raised on their behalf  particularly in the United States One American group  the Pro Life Action League  told an Irish newspaper in 2012 that anti abortion groups were raising hundreds of thousands of dollars to support Irish anti abortion groups like Youth Defence  which has been linked to far right movements in Europe Youth Defence did not respond to a request for comment  The Pro Life Action League s executive director  Eric J  Scheidler  said that the remarks concerned American support for the Irish anti abortion movement over several decades  and said his group had not raised money for the current campaign The Irish Center for Bio Ethical Reform  which picketed The Irish Times  receives foreign funding but claims to be exempt from government oversight   We are an educational body   Dr  Engela said He denied that the protest had anything to do with the coming vote  and asserted that some of the volunteers were full time activists with their own sources of funding Some commentators argue that anti abortion groups are not being held to the same stringent standard as abortion rights groups Theresa Reidy  a political scientist at University College Cork  said that there was a long history of overseas interests taking sides in Irish referendums  particularly on issues like the European Union  Over the last decade  even as support for the abortion ban has waned  concerns about possible outside interference have risen  she said Siobhan Mullally  of the Irish Center for Human Rights at the National University of Ireland  Galway  said the problem of undeclared foreign funding went beyond the abortion debate  and was  also a question about how charities are funded in general  The Roman Catholic Church  long a major power in Ireland  was the main driver in the 1983 referendum  The church also opposed  successfully  a referendum in 1986 that would have legalized divorce  In the decades since  however  its social and moral authority has been gravely weakened by a number of scandals  most notably clerical child sex abuse The church could not prevent the legalization of contraception and was on the losing side in referendums that legalized divorce in 1995 and same sex marriage in 2015 As a result  today s anti abortion activists are less overtly religious in their arguments  Instead  they are turning to arguments that abortion harms women s health  They are also turning to social media tools After recent revelations about the misuse of Facebook data to sway Britain s referendum on European Union membership in 2016  and the United States presidential election later that year  fears are growing similar tactics might be used in the referendum campaign The Save the 8th Campaign  an anti abortion group  has hired Kanto Systems  a London based political consultancy  to help run its campaign Kanto Systems s founder  Thomas Borwick  was chief technology officer for the Vote Leave campaign in Britain  and developed a canvassing app for Cambridge Analytica  the data mining organization that exploited Facebook data on behalf of the 2016 Trump campaign Mr  Borwick said that he himself had not worked for the Trump campaign  and referred a reporter to a statement from Save the 8th  which said that Kanto would be performing  some data analytics for us  but would not be engaged in  any voter profiling or voter targeting  John McGuirk  a spokesman for Save the 8th  said that in the Irish electoral system  which does not have online voter rolls  individually targeted advertising of the sort practiced by Cambridge Analytica would not be possible   In terms of targeting advertising at individual voters  we couldn t do that even if we wanted to  which we don t   he said The Times of London reported that the Pro Life Campaign  Ireland s largest umbrella anti abortion group  has retained uCampaign  a Washington firm that has developed apps for the Trump campaign  the National Rifle Association  the Republican National Committee and Vote Leave   Neither uCampaign nor the Pro Life Campaign responded to requests for comment  The Transparent Referendum Initiative  a small group of Irish technology advocates  said it had already detected paid social media campaigns stealthily targeting Irish voters  This month  the group introduced a crowdsourced monitoring tool to detect and investigate anonymous or vaguely sourced paid advertising on Facebook  It has already identified 92 such ads relating to the Irish referendum  55 with anti abortion messages and 37 in support of abortion rights Political advertising is banned on Irish television and radio  but the online world is a different matter  There is no law against someone anywhere else in the world signing a commercial contract with a British company to use foreign money or unknown money  that is not going through any official regulated campaign  in order to influence an Irish vote   said Liz Carolan of the Transparent Referendum Initiative   There s a serious vulnerability in our democratic system  And it s now being exploited by incredibly sophisticated campaign techniques  and Facebook doesn t have to tell us who s doing it  Responding to the Cambridge Analytica revelations  the Irish government announced last week that it planned to give Irish regulators new powers to curb external influence on Irish voters A spokeswoman for Facebook s Dublin office said that the company agreed with the need for more transparency in advertising  and that it was developing a new tool to help people identify paid ads in their timelines and to identify and label political content  However  she said  the tools will not be ready in time for the May referendum

Good Wednesday  Here s what we re watching   Are we witnessing the end of the tech mania   Amazon has shed more than  50 billion in market value  Are investors waking up to Tesla s real problem   Mark Zuckerberg agreed to testify before Congress   SoftBank and Saudi Arabia are planning the world s largest solar energy project Get this in your inbox each morning  Sign up here Investors  always willing to believe in technology companies  spent the last three years piling into the shares of companies like Facebook  Amazon and Netflix with special abandon  Now the intellectual underpinnings of the tech rally are being seriously tested Stocks in the best known tech companies have plunged in recent days  The NYSE FANG  index  which tracks the share price of 10 companies  including Facebook  Apple and Amazon  has fallen nearly 14 percent from its recent high  Given that the index has soared 50 percent in just the past 12 months  the recent decline could just be the sort of sell off that punctuates any long term rally Still  several large tech companies suddenly face challenges that could undermine their ability to transform whole industries  And as we ve seen after previous fervors  investors can take a long time to regain their faith Facebook is down 20 percent from its recent high  Most of the slide came after news reports showing how the company s data was misused  Investors have to grapple with the possibility that Facebook won t be sharing as much data as it does  undermining its ability to generate ever increasing amounts of advertising revenue Nvidia  a computer chip maker intent on being a leader in automated driving technology  is off 12 percent from its recent high  The company said on Tuesday that it would halt tests of its autonomous driving technology on public roads after an Uber self driving car hit and killed a pedestrian in Arizona Tesla is not a tech stock  but it is included in the FANG  index  and its supporters believe deeply in its power to revolutionize the auto industry  Growing fears about Tesla s ability to finance its expansion have helped drag its stock down 33 percent from its recent high  Ominously  the price of Tesla s bonds is also falling  signaling that the company is losing the confidence of creditors Of course  on their march higher  tech stocks overcame obstacles  like management problems at Uber and the poor performance of Snap s initial public offering But the latest problems have raised deeper  broader doubts  and that may keep the uncertainty around longer  Investors have viewed automated driving technology as a huge potential source of growth for some companies  But after the Uber incident in Arizona  those companies may take a more realistic look at what they have to spend to create a technology that is efficient and safe  and conclude that they have to pull out of the race or pare back  Users of social media and regulators may prevent social media companies from sharing so much of their data with advertisers  and that could restrain revenue growth And if the passion for two or three big tech companies wanes  the cooling may spread   Peter EavisThe reason Reports that President Trump wants to rein in the e commerce giant Jonathan Swan of Axios  citing anonymous sources  reported Mr  Swan added Shares of Amazon have tumbled more than 7 percent at one point Wednesday  but they pared those losses after a White House official told Reuters there were no specific policy changes related to Amazon being considered at the moment  But the official added that the administration is always looking at different options on a range of policy issues How concerned should investors be GBH Insights analyst Daniel Ives writes Guess which companies are benefiting from Amazon s woes  Retailers  the FT points out On a day when the stocks on Wall Street are flat  Macy s was up 3 5 percent  J C  Penney has gained 5 5 percent  Walmart rose 1 7 percent  Target increased 1 8 percent  and Kohl s was up 2 4 percent The electric carmaker s shares are down 7 percent Wednesday  after plunging 8 percent on Tuesday Tuesday s slide was driven  in part  by the National Transportation Safety Board s announcement that it was investigating a fatal crash last week involving a Tesla vehicle in California  News that Jaguar Land Rover was teaming up with Alphabet Inc  s Waymo unit probably didn t help either But the continued decline in Tesla s stock   its shares are down more than 20 percent since mid March   speaks to the bigger concern surrounding Tesla  How it funds itself Investors have grown increasingly worried as Tesla burns through cash and struggles to meet its own production goals for the Model 3  Late Tuesday  Moody s downgraded Tesla s credit rating further into junk territory and said its outlook on the company is negative  The credit ratings agency cited production delays and said Tesla may soon need to raise more than  2 billion Those concerns can be seen not just in Tesla s stock price but also in the trading of its debt  The FT points out that  Tesla s eight year bond maturing in 2025 traded on Wednesday at 87 6 cents to the dollar  the lowest since issuance  The yield has surged to 7 5 percent from 6 59 percent on Monday  Liam Denning of Bloomberg Gadfly writes The fallout from Facebook s Cambridge Analytica scandal has spread to Twitter The stock tumbled 12 percent Tuesday after Citron Research s Andrew Left said he was betting against the social media company because of its vulnerability to regulation around how it handles user data But analysts at Barclays disagree  They argue in a recent note to clients that Twitter s data business likely won t be impacted much by any regulation on its use of user data  The credit reporting company named Mark Begor  a private equity executive who once led General Electric s credit card business  as its new chief executive Mr  Begor  59  takes over for Paulino do Rego Barros Jr   who has filled the role on an interim basis since September  when Richard F  Smith stepped down after a data breach exposed sensitive personal information  including Social Security numbers  of 148 million people Mr  Begor will start at Equifax on April 16 About Mr  Begor  The 59 year old is a managing director at the private equity firm Warburg Pincus  He is also a member of the board at the credit scoring company FICO   Mr  Begor spent 35 years at General Electric  where his duties included leading the conglomerate s real estate investment and energy management units  For nine years  he was president and chief executive of the company s consumer credit business  which was later spun off as Synchrony Financial His pay packageEquifax said it would give Mr  Begor stock and options valued at  17 million this year and an annual salary and bonus of up to  4 5 million President Trump has scored a significant trade deal with South Korea But with Mr  Trump preparing to meet with North Korea s leader  Kim Jong un   who just took an armored train trip to Beijing   and the North apparently pressing on with nuclear developments  an  America first  trade stance was far from the only thing pushing the South to sign  More from Michael D  Shear and Alan Rappeport The Trump administration continues to ramp up its trade rhetoric with China  Unidentified sources told Bloomberg that it is considering invoking an emergency law to restrict Chinese investments in sensitive U S  tech  A separate plan to enact tariffs on  60 billion of Chinese goods has left companies wondering which industries will be targeted  Other Asian countries increasingly fear being caught in the crossfire of a trade war  the WSJ reports And nations are already reacting to Trump s trade moves  erecting  barriers to stop the steel and aluminum that faces tariffs in the U S  being dumped in their markets Against this background  NXP sold its 40 percent stake in a Chinese joint venture on chip design Companies like Facebook  Amazon and Alphabet have delivered some of the best returns to investors in recent years  powered by the achievements and the promise of social media and artificial intelligence But that confidence is evaporating  as investors brace for intensified regulatory scrutiny across the industry  Tech stocks took a pummeling yesterday and in early European trading Twitter dropped 12 percent after Andrew Left s Citron Research said it was shorting the company Critic s corner  The  sector s growing clout over everyday life also raises the risks of what can go wrong   Dan Gallagher argues at WSJ s Heard on the Street The public outcry over Facebook s data and privacy settings has grown loud enough that Mark Zuckerberg now says he s willing to testify to Congress  The company is on a hiring spree for lobbyists  too  and unnamed sources say it s putting off the promotion of new home products The man who started all this  the Cambridge Analytica whistle

tumbled 8 2 percent  after the National Transportation Safety Board said it was conducting its second crash investigation of the year involving one of the company s cars  There s also anxiety about whether it will hit production goals Uber said it would not renew its California permit for self driving vehicle tests until investigations were complete in Arizona  And it s facing questions over a

Good Tuesday  Here s what we re watching   So you want to be Deutsche Bank s next C E O     Investors are selling tech again   Will Wall Street s top regulator keep going after bad bankers   More potential limits on gun sales  Facebook s growing political troubles  Uber s self driving travailsGet this in your inbox each morning  Sign up here Imagine you are applying to be the C E O  of Deutsche Bank now that it s reportedly seeking a successor to John Cryan  the bank s current chief You survey the bank s numbers to get a sense of the opportunities and challenges you d face Staring you in the face is the stock price  down nearly 30 percent this year  Ugly  but it could be a good entry point  It gives you time to try out some tough measures aimed at improving Deutsche Bank s performance  Even if those moves produce near term losses  the stock may not dive  given how far it s already fallen Then you look at the strength of Deutsche Bank s capital  as expressed by a regulatory measure called the common equity tier 1 capital ratio  That s at 14 percent  a solid looking level  achieved in part by an  8 billion equity raise last year  In theory  you have something to spend on your chosen plans But then you realize that Deutsche Bank s share price is now back at the level at which the bank sold those shares  Shareholders must be livid  Not only that  Deutsche Bank s stock market value is less than 40 percent of its net worth as stated on its balance sheet  its stock price is  11 30 and its book value per share is  30 16   When a company trades at a hefty discount to its net worth  it either needs to raise a lot of new capital  which doesn t seem to be the case at Deutsche Bank  or investors have serious doubts about the company s business model  So  I ll rejig the bank s business model   you say to yourself   that s what new C E O  s do  You look for ways and stumble upon an unavoidable obstacle  Deutsche Bank is heavily dependent on Wall Street revenue  which can be far more unpredictable than revenue from other businesses  Last year  revenue from Deutsche Bank s corporate and investment bank  which has struggled to keep up with its peers  accounted for 54 percent of the bank s overall revenue  Compare that with JPMorgan Chase  whose investment bank accounted for a third of its revenue last year  And you are stuck with the Wall Street operations  no one wants to buy an investment bank with  1 2 trillion in assets Maybe you can cut costs  another go to tactic of an incoming C E O  Indeed  Deutsche Bank s investment bank employees seem better paid than their counterparts at other firms  Going by a back of the envelope calculation  the unit s compensation expense is equivalent to 44 percent of its revenue  excluding the interest the investment bank earns on its assets   That s higher than the 39 percent ratio for JPMorgan s investment bank last year  and 41 percent for Goldman Sachs  Maybe you could slash the pay of bankers and traders Sorry  Mr  Cryan tried that   Peter EavisThe roller coaster ride in tech continues The tech heavy Nasdaq Composite tumbled nearly 3 percent  while the Dow Jones industrial average and the S  P  500 fell 1 4 percent and 1 7 percent Tech companies in the S  P  500 tech sector slid 3 4 percent  the steepest decline among the index s 11 main sectors Chip makers were among the hardest hit on the day  Shares of Nvidia dropped 7 8 percent after it said it was halting tests on self driving cars Nvidia s slide weighed on the shares of rival chip makers  Micron Technologies fell 5 7 percent  and AMD dropped 4 2 percent But semiconductor companies were hardly the only ones getting pummeled  The famed FANG stocks  among the biggest gainers over the past year  tumbled Tuesday  Facebook  Amazon  Netflix and Google parent Alphabet all finished down more than 4 5 percent Tesla tumbled 8 2 percent on news that the National Transportation Safety Board is conducting its second investigation this year into a Tesla car crash  The stock is off nearly 20 percent since March 12 on increasing concerns that the electric car maker will fall short of its production goals for the Model 3 Twitter dropped 12 percent after Andrew Left s Citron Research said it was shorting the social media company Tuesday s fall continued the recent volatility in American stocks  and specifically  the shares of tech companies  Enthusiasm about the technology sector had long propelled stock markets to new heights  But the specter of intensifying regulation of the industry has taken the sheen off  Last week tech stocks dragged the broader markets to their worst week in more than two years  The selling took a break on Monday as the S  P  500 s tech sector rose 4 percent pushing the index to its best day in almost three years A vigorous debate is taking place over who should become the next head of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York  a powerful regulator on Wall Street s front lines Contenders for the post should address one question  What will you do to clean up the culture at banks William C  Dudley  the outgoing president of the New York Fed  had made improving the culture at the firms he oversaw a key initiative of his tenure of at the institution When Mr  Dudley took the helm in 2009  the financial crisis had left the New York Fed s reputation as a regulator damaged  The institution had not done enough to address the severe weaknesses at the banks it oversaw  like Citigroup  Early on  Mr  Dudley commissioned a review of the New York Fed s bank supervision department and then overhauled it  But in 2012  JPMorgan Chase  also overseen by the New York Fed  suffered huge trading losses in what was known as the London Whale scandal  The New York Fed was faulted Following the embarrassing London Whale imbroglio  Mr  Dudley used his bully pulpit to focus on bankers  ethics  Banks were stronger financially  but recent scandals showed that the culture of their firms still needed to improve  he observed  And if a cleanup didn t occur  it may be a sign that they needed to be reduced in size  Mr  Dudley said in a 2014 speech that rattled Wall Street The next big banking scandal   Wells Fargo s widespread mistreatment of customers  which came to light in 2016   strongly supported Mr  Dudley s arguments  Wells Fargo was considered one of the most stable  too big to fail  banks  with its focus on plain vanilla lending  but in fact  its retail sales culture had degraded  The Fed earlier this year slapped relatively harsh sanctions on the bank  including a limit on its size The example of Wells Fargo is pertinent for John C  Williams  a top candidate to replace Mr  Dudley  Mr  Williams is head of the San Francisco Fed  which oversees Wells Fargo And there is still work to do to fulfill Mr  Dudley s initiative  He proposed a  database of banker misconduct   similar to the one for brokers  that would track a banker s record on ethics and compliance  Banks could consult it before hiring  But this idea has not taken off  In a speech at the U S  Chamber of Commerce on Monday  Mr  Dudley explained why   Understandably  firms are concerned about legal risk if they share information about banker misconduct  but there may be ways to address these concerns through legislation  Mr  Dudley had also pressed banks  boards of directors to focus on ethical culture  On Monday  he said the boards had set up separate committees to focus on culture and conduct   We ve made part of the journey but I think more could be done   Mr  Dudley said  Whether it will  depends on who steps into his shoes   Peter EavisThe yield curve is near its flattest level since the financial crisis  The difference between the yields on the two year and 10 year Treasury notes is at 0 52 percentage points  not far off its post crisis low of 0 50 percentage points hit in January That has some asking if the nine year old economic recovery is at risk Since the end of World War II  no barometer has done a better job of predicting a recession than the yield curve  A flattening yield curve tends to indicate slowing economic growth in the near future  But what is more worrisome is if the yield curve goes beyond flattening and into outright inversion The chances of a recession when the yield curve is flattening is just 20 percent  according to the calculations of Jim Paulsen  the chief investment strategist at the Leuthold Group  That jumps to 72 percent when the curve inverts There is another reason not to be too concerned about a flattening yield curve  and it has to do with the actions of central banks around the world  The unprecedented stimulus from the Fed  Bank of Japan and E C B  have brought down long term rates  That means the yield curve might not be the predictor it once was A week after a self driving Uber vehicle hit and killed a woman in Arizona  the fallout continues to spread Nvidia on Tuesday said it had suspended self driving tests in New Jersey  Santa Clara  Japan and Germany  A Nvidia spokesperson said in a statement  using A V  as an abbreviation for automated vehicles  Nvidia s artificial intelligence platform is the

all already done so Roger Lanctot  an automotive technology analyst with Strategy Analytics  wrote Citigroup became the biggest Wall Street firm thus far to take actions to limit gun sales  Others  like JPMorgan Chase  Bank of America  Visa and Mastercard  are studying options   Bank of America and JPMorgan are two of the bankruptcy lenders to Remington Outdoor  along with Wells Fargo  which is the N R A  s bank of choice  In his latest column  Andrew suggests these new tactics   Credit card issuers and banks could give gun sellers who have announced restrictions on sales  like Walmart and Dick s Sporting Goods  a special merchant category code  That could help financial firms decide with whom they want to do business   Payment processors could geofence gun shows and enforce restrictions on transactions coming from those GPS coordinates Here s what Citi s C E O   Mike Corbat  told Andrew about his firm s actions Where to begin  The company faces inquiries from the Federal Trade Commission  the Senate Judiciary Committee  several state attorneys general and the watchdog group Common Cause  And Britain s Parliament asked Mark Zuckerberg to testify  he s sending a deputy

AggregateIQ  a digital marketer with ties to Cambridge Analytica Critics  corner  Nir Kaissar of Gadfly thinks that the big question is how many users value privacy more than having a Facebook account  Charlie Warzel of BuzzFeed argues the Cambridge Analytica scandal could lead to  a full scale personal and public reckoning that looks at the way we ve used the internet for the last decade  Bankers and deal lawyers may want to send some of their bonus to Amazon this year  M  A  activity is running at record levels and concerns about the e commerce giant have played a role in driving a number of the largest deals The latest  GlaxoSmithKline s decision to buy out Novartis s stake in their consumer health joint venture  which includes Sensodyne toothpaste  for  13 billion Amazon may not have been the main reason  but its impact on the pricing of consumer health products likely played a role Historically  such products have lower margins than prescription drugs  but customers that keep coming back  Sales  though  are slowing  up just 3 percent over the past two years  half the rate of the previous two  according to Morgan Stanley  Price competition from online retailers like Amazon has some worried it could decelerate further That partly helps explain why Novartis was willing to exit the business So why was Glaxo willing to pay up for the business 1  Starting this month Novartis had the right to require Glaxo purchase its stake in the joint venture  Doing the deal now removes uncertainty 2  The deal will allow its new chief executive to  get on with fixing GSK s pharmaceutical division  which suffers from a relatively lackluster pipeline of new drugs   writes Neil Unmack of Breakingviews  Shares of Glaxo have gained 6 3 percent The S  P  500 rose 2 7 percent yesterday  its best day in nearly three years  as President Trump would be happy to tell you   Maybe it s because  as Peter Eavis writes  the president s threats of a trade war with China might be merely negotiating tactics More from Peter  According to this view  the tariff proposal was a jarring move partly aimed at getting China to see that the U S  was serious about shifting trade terms  If China doesn t show real signs that it will do more to open its markets  Mr  Trump could up the ante   roiling the markets again  But the White House s more conciliatory tone yesterday after last week s sell off suggests there is not a strong desire for a full trade war But remember that Beijing is firmly committed to its industrial policy  while the U S  is equally adamant about letting American companies operate more freely in China   Even if G M  and Ford  who have joint ventures with Chinese companies  wouldn t benefit from a lower tariff on U S  car imports   And Stephen Roach of Yale

 Reuters    Facebook Inc is giving users more control over their privacy by making data management easier and redesigning the settings menu  the company said on Wednesday  in the wake of a scandal over a breach that exposed the personal information of millions and was allegedly used by a political consultancy The company also said it would propose in the coming weeks updates to the social media website s terms of service and data policy to better spell out what information it collects and how it uses it The company has faced a global outcry after a whistleblower said that data from millions of users was improperly harvested by consultancy Cambridge Analytica to target U S  and British voters in close run elections Facebook shares are down nearly 18 percent since March 16  when it first acknowledged that user data had been improperly channeled to Cambridge Analytica  eating away nearly  100 billion of the company s market value  We ve heard loud and clear that privacy settings and other important tools are too hard to find  and that we must do more to keep people informed   Erin Egan  Facebook s chief privacy officer  and Ashlie Beringer  its deputy general counsel  said in a statement In addition to redesigning its settings menu on mobile devices  Facebook said it is creating a new privacy shortcut menu where users would be able to better secure their accounts and control personal information  It would also allow users to review and delete data they have shared  including posts and search queries Users would be able to download the data shared with Facebook  including uploaded photos  contacts added to their account  and posts on timelines  Reporting by Philip George and Ismail Shakil in Bengaluru  Editing by Bernard Orr 
NEW YORK    Facebook is giving its privacy tools a makeover as it reels from criticisms over its data practices and faces tighter European regulations in the coming months The changes won t affect Facebook s privacy policies or the types of data it gathers on users  But the company hopes its 2 2 billion users will have an easier time navigating its complex and often confusing privacy and security settings  Facebook says it also wants to give users a simpler way to access and download the data it collects on them Wednesday s announcement follows revelations that a Trump affiliated consulting firm  Cambridge Analytica  got data on millions of Facebook users  That included information on friends of people who had downloaded a psychological quiz app  even though those friends hadn t given explicit consent to sharing  In addition  Facebook is also facing widespread criticism for collecting years of contact names  telephone numbers and call and text histories from Android users  The company has not said exactly what it used such data for or why it needed it  On Monday  the Federal Trade Commission said it is investigating Facebook over its privacy practices Facebook s chief privacy officer  Erin Egan  said in a blog post that most of the privacy updates have been in the works for  some time  but the events of the past several days underscore their importance  Facebook also said it plans to update its privacy policy and terms of service in the coming weeks  but gave no further details The company has tried over the years to simplify its privacy settings  yet the controls remain hard to find and use for many people  For example  Facebook announced in 2009 that it was consolidating six privacy pages and more than 30 settings on to a single privacy page Yet mobile users still had to go to nearly 20 different places to access all of their privacy controls  Now  Facebook says they will be accessible from a single place  Facebook says it is also adding  clearer explanations  about how its privacy controls work Chris Cox  Facebook s chief product officer  called the new settings  the first of many steps  the company is taking to address privacy concerns Facebook has been working on the changes in preparation for the European Union s General Data Protection Regulation  which were approved two years ago and take effect May 25  The rules are designed to make it easier for consumers to give and withdraw consent for the use of their data  They apply to any company that collects data on EU residents  no matter where it is based To comply with this  Facebook is adding a section called  access your information   a secure way for users to manage data they ve shared with the company  including status updates  comments and things they have searched for  That s where people can go to delete information or download a copy  While this download was already possible  it took some time to figure out how to do it  Cox said the changes let people browse through their information in detail  without having to download it  For example  users will now be able to look up a post from a specific date in the past Cox said that while the changes are  in line with the principle of GDPR   there s also a  bunch of stuff that goes above and beyond that  Facebook also said it will propose updates to its terms of service in the coming weeks and update its privacy policy  but gave no further details 
NEW YORK    The Latest on reports that millions of Facebook users  data was used to target political ads  all times local  3 30 p m Cook County is suing Facebook and Cambridge Analytica for fraud after revelations that the latter obtained data on millions of Facebook users The lawsuit filed Friday in Cook County Circuit Court alleges Trump affiliated political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica deceived the millions of Illinois Facebook users whose information it collected  It says Facebook failed to protect its users  privacy and misrepresented how their data would be used London based Cambridge Analytica has been accused of using Facebook data to influence voter behavior in U S  elections The Chicago Tribune reports the lawsuit filed by Cook County State s Attorney Kimberly Foxx on behalf of Illinois residents brings one consumer fraud count each against Facebook and Cambridge Analytica  It seeks  50 000 fines for each violation of the law Neither company has commented on the lawsuit    2 20 p m The chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee says he s invited Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to testify at a hearing next month on data privacy Sen  Charles Grassley of Iowa says the April 10 hearing will cover how consumer data is collected  retained and distributed for commercial use  He says the hearing also will examine what steps companies like Facebook can do to better protect personal information Grassley s committee is the third congressional panel to seek Zuckerberg s testimony in the wake of a privacy scandal involving Cambridge Analytica  a Trump connected data mining company Several Judiciary Committee members had pressed Grassley to hold the hearing Grassley says he s also invited Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey    12 15 p m The chief law enforcement officers for 37 U S  states and territories are demanding to know when Facebook learned of a huge breach of privacy protections The officers say in a letter Monday to CEO Mark Zuckerberg that users  trust in the social media platform is  broken  The attorneys general are asking how Facebook monitored what these developers did with all the data they collected and whether Facebook had safeguards to prevent misuse They also asked Zuckerberg for an update on how Facebook will allow users to more easily control the privacy of their accounts Cambridge Analytica  a political data mining firm  is accused of lifting data from some 50 million Facebook users to influence voters in U S  elections    11 55 a m Germany s justice minister says she wants closer oversight of companies such as Facebook  following a meeting with executives about the abuse of users  private data Katarina Barley says Facebook representatives assured her Monday that such breaches wouldn t occur again and pledged to inform those users who were affected She added that  promises aren t enough  though  We will need to monitor companies such as Facebook much more strictly in future and also punish breaches of data protection strongly  swiftly and painfully  Barley said Facebook reacted  favorably  to her demand for greater transparency about the algorithms that underpin the company s data collection She said campaigns such as  Delete Facebook  would likely make a strong impression on the company because  in the end the currency that Facebook works with is trust     10 50 a m The Federal Trade Commission is investigating Facebook s privacy practices following a week of privacy scandals including whether the company engaged in  unfair acts  that cause  substantial injury  to consumers Facebook s stock  which already took a big hit last week  plunged as a result Facebook said in a statement on Monday that the company remains  strongly committed  to protecting people s information and that it welcomes the opportunity to answer the FTC s questions News outlets have reported on the FTC investigation last week  but the FTC hadn t confirmed it until Monday  Facebook reached a settlement with the FTC in 2011 offering privacy assurances    5 a m Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is promising to do a better job protecting user data following reports that a political consultant misused the personal information of millions of the company s subscribers  The fact is  European regulators are already forcing him to do so A similar data breach in the future could make Facebook liable for fines of more than  1 6 billion under the European Union s new General Data Protection Regulation  which will be enforced from May 25  The rules  approved two years ago  also make it easier for consumers to give and withdraw consent for the use of their data and apply to any company that uses the data of EU residents  no matter where it is based 
NEW YORK    To get an idea of the data Facebook collects about you  just ask for it  You ll get a file with every photo and comment you ve posted  all the ads you ve clicked on  stuff you ve liked and searched for and everyone you ve friended   and unfriended   over the years Now  the company is under fire for collecting data on people s phone calls and text messages if they used Android devices  While Facebook insists users had to specifically agree  or opt in  to have such data collected  at least some users appeared surprised Facebook s trove of data is used to decide which ads to show you  It also makes using Facebook more seamless and enjoyable   say  by determining which posts to emphasize in your feed  or reminding you of friends  birthdays Facebook claims to protect all this information  and it lays out its terms in a privacy policy that s relatively clear and concise  But few users bother to read it  You might be surprised at what Facebook s privacy policy allows   and what s left unsaid Facebook s privacy practices have come under fire after a Trump affiliated political consulting firm  Cambridge Analytica  got data inappropriately from millions of Facebook users  While past privacy debacles have centered on what marketers gather on users  the stakes are higher this time because the firm is alleged to have created psychological profiles to influence how people vote or even think about politics and society Facebook defends its data collection and sharing activities by noting that it s adhering to a privacy policy it shares with users  Thanks largely to years of privacy scandals and pressure from users and regulators  Facebook also offers a complex set of controls that let users limit how their information is used   to a point You can turn off ad targeting and see generic ads instead  the way you would on television or in a newspaper  In the ad settings  you d need to uncheck all your interests  interactions with companies and websites and other personal information you don t want to use in targeting  Of course  if you click on a new interest after this  you ll have to go back and uncheck it in your ad preferences to prevent targeting  It s a tedious task As Facebook explains  it puts you in target categories based on your activity  So  if you are 35  live in Seattle and have liked an outdoor adventure page  Facebook may show you an ad for a mountain bike shop in your area But activity isn t limited to pages or posts you like  comments you make and your use of outside apps and websites  If you start typing something and change your mind and delete it  Facebook keeps those and analyzes them too   Zeynep Tufekci  a prominent techno sociologist  said in a 2017 TED talk And  increasingly  Facebook tries to match what it knows about you with your offline data  purchased from data brokers or gathered in other ways  The more information it has  the fuller the picture of you it can offer to advertisers  It can infer things about you that you had no intention of sharing   anything from your ethnicity to personality traits  happiness and use of addictive substances  Tufekci said These types of data collection aren t necessarily explicit in privacy policies or settings What Facebook does say is that advertisers don t get the raw data  They just tell Facebook what kind of people they want their ads to reach  then Facebook makes the matches and shows the ads Apps can also collect a lot of data about you  as revealed in the Cambridge Analytica scandal  The firm got the data from a researcher who paid 270 000 Facebook users to complete a psychological profile quiz back in 2014  But the quiz gathered information on their friends as well  bringing the total number of people affected to about 50 million Facebook says Cambridge Analytica got the data inappropriately   but only because the app said it collected data for research rather than political profiling  Gathering data on friends was permitted at the time  even if they had never installed the app or given explicit consent Ian Bogost  a Georgia Tech communications professor who built a tongue in cheek game called  Cow Clicker  in 2010  wrote in The Atlantic recently that abusing the Facebook platform for  deliberately nefarious ends  was easy to do then  What s worse  he said  it was hard to avoid extracting private data If  you played Cow Clicker  even just once  I got enough of your personal data that  for years  I could have assembled a reasonably sophisticated profile of your interests and behavior   he wrote   I might still be able to  all the data is still there  stored on my private server  where Cow Clicker is still running  allowing players to keep clicking where a cow once stood  Facebook has since restricted the amount of types of data apps can access  But other types of data collection are still permitted  For this reason  it s a good idea to check all the apps you ve given permissions to over the years  You can also do this in your settings 
The Reader Center is one way we in the newsroom are trying to connect with you  by highlighting your perspectives and experiences and offering insight into how we work Last weekend  Alyssa Severson  a member of our Reader Center Facebook Group  posed a question to her fellow group members   Are you emotionally affected by the news  Sometimes reading about politics  human rights infringements  war zones  etc  can make me feel anxious or hopeless in a big way  What are some coping strategies you employ  Coincidentally  a story published the same day profiled an Ohio man who has unplugged from news media entirely and describes himself as  bored  yet happy  But our roundup of reactions to the story suggested many readers don t consider such a drastic solution acceptable What s the alternative  Reader Center Facebook Group members shared a mélange of ideas for keeping news generated stress at bay  After you read them  tell us some of the ways you tackle this kind of anxiety Comments below have been condensed and edited for clarity Alyssa Severson  Thailand   Sometimes I ll put a moratorium on a certain subject if it s bringing up really negative feelings   Right now  no Myanmar ethnic cleansing articles   Sometimes realizing how many things are wrong with the world gives me a serious existential crisis  but I think that s just part of life when you care about others Abby Leafe  Newtown  Pa    How do I cope  I detach  And I remind myself that it s a long game  Plus  I m running for office Stacie Birchett  Richmond  Va    Outlander reruns Marjie Gowdy  Callaway  Va    I ve watched La La Land more times than I can count Jeffrey Itell  Vietnam   I read the news in the context that good  news  is happening always  I read The Times to find out when Mount Agung is spewing lava     and not for the magnificent view it provides from Gili Trawangan  The Times reports the news  which includes important events I want to know about  But it doesn t provide me a complete snapshot of the world Shasta Gaughen  Escondido  Ca    When it gets to be too much  I ll delete my sources without reading and take a timeout  Cats help  And ice cream  Lots of ice cream  Here s one of my cats encouraging me to take a break Elaine Tanzman  Sometimes reading disturbing news will inspire me to contribute to organizations that I have forgotten about  For example  after reading about the Neo Nazi riots in Charlottesville  I donated to the Southern Poverty Law Center Daniel Mainz  Brooklyn  NY   I ve appreciated a couple of news sources that combine research and commentary with practical  actionable steps readers can take to make their voices heard  They are DCReport org from Pulitzer winner David Cay Johnston and Lauren Duca s columns in Teen Vogue  Yes  I admit it  Teen Vogue  I read it for the politics Deb Amlen  New York Times crossword columnist   I do regular news fasts and have tried not to wallow on places like Twitter  Also  did you know that the crossword puzzle was originally run in newspapers as an escape from the news pages during World War II  It still allows readers to keep their brains sharp and talk about something other than world events Anna Núñez  Houston  Texas   Dealing with daily barbaric immigration news is part of my job  copywriter for America s Voice   At the end of the day  baking and cooking soothes me and I was grateful for this recent NYT recipe that I highly recommend to calm you  too Fadi BouKaram  Lebanon   Thankfully  I ve been reading Reader s Digest since I was a kid  It might be perceived as cheesy  but the  positive news  in it is a good reminder that the frequency of what s covered by media does not reflect the reality of how the world is Deborah Suraya  New York City   Having dinner together with friends really helps because there is usually a lot of laughter  chatter  etc  I also follow comedians on Twitter Instagram  not just pure news outlets Julia Lansford  from Russia  living in NYC   World can seem a horrible place at a glance  However  NYT has a great project  The Week in Good News  When down from all the negativity  I also remember that dialogue between Frodo and Sam Gamgee in Peter Jackson s  The Lord of the Rings  FRODO  What are we holding on to  Sam SAM  That there s some good in this world  Mr  Frodo  And it s worth fighting for Alexandra Velasco  Queens  NY   I m a democrat and  at the time  I couldn t understand why anyone would vote for Trump  But since he got elected  I ve been fascinated by reasons why people voted for him  and have been trying to find some understanding in their reasoning  Trying to understand people with different viewpoints has helped me cope 
I don t need to tell you that something is wrong with social media You ve probably experienced it yourself  Maybe it s the way you feel while scrolling through your Twitter feed   anxious  twitchy  a little world weary   or your unease when you see a child watching YouTube videos  knowing she s just a few algorithmic nudges away from a rabbit hole filled with lunatic conspiracies and gore  Or maybe it was this month s Facebook privacy scandal  which reminded you that you ve entrusted the most intimate parts of your digital life to a profit maximizing surveillance machine Our growing discomfort with our largest social platforms is reflected in polls  One recently conducted by Axios and SurveyMonkey found that all three of the major social media companies   Facebook  Twitter and Google  which shares a parent company with YouTube   are significantly less popular with Americans than they were five months ago   And Americans might be the lucky ones  Outside the United States  social media is fueling real world violence and empowering autocrats  often with much less oversight  But it would be a mistake to throw up our hands and assume that it has to be this way  The original dream of social media   producing healthy discussions  unlocking new forms of creativity  connecting people to others with similar interests   shouldn t be discarded because of the failures of the current market leaders  And lots of important things still happen on even the most flawed networks  The West Virginia teachers  strike and last weekend s March for Our Lives  for example  were largely organized on Facebook and Twitter The primary problem with today s social networks is that they re already too big  and are trapped inside a market based system that forces them to keep growing  Facebook can t stop monetizing our personal data for the same reason that Starbucks can t stop selling coffee   it s the heart of the enterprise Many of the fixes being proposed involve regulation  The Honest Ads Act  a bill in the Senate  would require greater transparency for online political ads  The European Union s General Data Protection Regulation  which goes into effect in May  aims to give users greater control of their digital information trails But these efforts don t touch the underlying problems  and in fact could make it harder for start ups to compete with the giants If we re really serious about changing how social networks operate  far more radical interventions are required  Here are three possible ways to rescue social media from the market based pressures that got us here In their book  New Power   which comes out next week  Jeremy Heimans and Henry Timms write about the struggle between centralized  top down institutions  which represent  old power   and decentralized  bottom up movements  which represent  new power  Facebook  they write  is an example of a new power institution that serves old power interests  It harvests the creative output of billions of people and turns it into a giant  centralized enterprise  with most users sharing none of the economic value they create and getting no say in the platform s governance Instead  the authors ask  what if a social network was truly run by its users  If you re contributing economic value to something of this much social consequence  you should share in the value you re creating   Mr  Heimans told me Nathan Schneider  a professor of media studies at the University of Colorado  had a similar idea in 2016  when he proposed that Twitter users band together to buy the platform from its shareholders and convert it into a user run collective  similar to the way a local credit union is run  People who made valuable contributions to the network  such as employees and power users  would receive bigger stakes and more voting power  And users would have a seat at the table for major decisions about the platform s operations It s exceedingly unlikely that Mark Zuckerberg  who has fought hard to keep control of Facebook  will ever convert the company into a user owned and run collective  But Mr  Schneider believes that giving more control to responsible users could help restore trust in the network  and signal the kind of values Mr  Zuckerberg says he wants Facebook to represent  He could show that he takes democracy seriously enough to start with his own baby   Mr  Schneider said Another radical approach would be to make social networks work more like email   so that independent apps could seamlessly work together with one another  across a common protocol Instead of one big Facebook  a federated social network would look like clusters of independent nodes   Mombook and Athletebook and Gamerbook   all of which could be plugged into the umbrella network when it made sense  Rather than requiring a one size fits all set of policies that apply to billions of users  these nodes could be designed to reflect users  priorities   A network for privacy hawks and one for open sharing maximalists could have different data retention rules  and a network for L G B T  users and one for evangelical pastors could have different hate speech rules   If a node became too toxic  it could be removed without shutting down the entire network  Email is the most resilient social network on the internet   Mr  Schneider said   and the thing that allows it to adapt is that it s an open protocol  and people build apps on top of it  and we evolve how we use it  Versions of this kind of network already exist  Mastodon  a decentralized Twitter like social network  has gotten more than a million registered users since its debut in 2016  And various social networks based on the blockchain   the ledger system that underlies virtual currencies like Bitcoin   have sprung up in recent months To be sure  decentralized networks have their own problems  They re messy to administer  and they can still be gamed by bad actors  They can also fall prey to the same kind of privacy issues that Facebook is being criticized for   In fact  part of the reason users are angry at Facebook right now is that the company s data infrastructure was too open  and made it overly simple for third party app developers to take user information outside Facebook  None of this is a panacea  But experimenting with more decentralized models could give social media users a sense that platforms represented their interests  rather than those of a faceless corporation A single friend of mine once remarked that the major difference among dating apps like OKCupid  Tinder and Bumble wasn t the way they were designed or the companies behind them   it was how long they had existed New apps  she said  were more likely to attract interesting and smart people who were actually looking for dates  Older apps  by contrast  were eventually overrun with creeps and predators  no matter how well built they were A similar theory might apply to social networks  Facebook  Twitter  YouTube  Instagram and Snapchat all had plenty of issues in their early years  but they were by and large cleaner  with fewer types of exploitation and malicious behavior  Today  the enormous size and influence of these platforms have made them irresistible honey pots for bad actors  and many of our  social graphs    Facebook s term for the webs of digital connections we create   are clogged with years  worth of clutter In a blog post last year  the venture capitalist Hunter Walk proposed an interesting idea  a legally mandated  start over  button that  when pressed  would allow users of social networks to delete all their data  clear out their feeds and friend lists  and begin with a fresh account I d go even further  and suggest that social networks give their users an automatic  self cleaning  option  which would regularly clear their profiles of apps they no longer used  friendships and followers they no longer interacted with  and data they no longer needed to store  If these tools were enabled  users would need to take affirmative action if they didn t want their information to disappear after a certain number of months or years Making social graphs temporary  rather than preserving them forever by default  would undoubtedly be bad for most social networks  business models  But it could create new and healthy norms around privacy and data hygiene  and it would keep problems from piling up as networks get older and more crowded  It might even recapture some of the magic of the original social networks  when things were fresh and fascinating  and not quite so scary 
A parade of regulators  politicians and law enforcement officials demanded to know more about Facebook s privacy practices on Monday  as the fallout from the company s relationship with a political data firm continued to spread Early in the day  the Federal Trade Commission confirmed reports that it was investigating how Facebook handles information about its users Soon after  Senator Charles E  Grassley  Republican of Iowa and chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee  invited Mark Zuckerberg  Facebook s chief executive  to testify about privacy standards next month  He also extended invitations to Google s chief executive  Sundar Pichai  and Twitter s chief executive  Jack Dorsey And a group of 37 attorneys general sent Mr  Zuckerberg a letter asking for details about Facebook s privacy safeguards But one group of people interested in Facebook   investors   had a muted reaction to the growing regulatory threat  Shares of Facebook fell sharply after the F T C  confirmed its investigation but ended the day up 0 4 percent as overall trading on Wall Street recovered from a big drop last week The federal investigation and threats followed recent news that the data collection firm Cambridge Analytica  which worked on the 2016 Trump presidential campaign  gained access to the personal data of more than 50 million Facebook users The F T C  said it planned to determine whether the social media giant had violated a consent decree it signed in 2011 to protect users  privacy The decree required Facebook to notify and receive explicit permission from users before sharing their personal information beyond the limits dictated by their privacy settings  Each violation of the agreement  which the agency reached with Facebook as part of a settlement over third party apps  carries a penalty of up to  40 000 a day The agency s acknowledgment of its investigation helped push Facebook s stock down as much as 6 5 percent on Monday morning before it recovered  Facebook said last week that it was anticipating an inquiry by the agency The F T C  said in a statement on Monday that it  takes very seriously recent press reports raising substantial concerns about the privacy practices of Facebook  Lawmakers have repeatedly called for Mr  Zuckerberg to appear in hearings on Capitol Hill  Last week  the Republican and Democratic leaders of the House and Senate commerce committees formally invited him to testify  I m sure this is much bigger than Cambridge Analytica  and I m sure there are other Cambridge Analyticas out there   Senator John Kennedy  Republican from Louisiana  said in an interview   Facebook isn t just a company  It is so powerful it is like a country  Some lawmakers  such as Senator Richard Blumenthal  Democrat from Connecticut  asked the F T C  to look into whether Facebook should pay damages to users  The sphere of scrutiny must be broader than just the consent decree   he said in a statement   There is no excuse for delay  Cambridge Analytica is facing intense criticism  too  On Monday  Common Cause  a government watchdog group in Washington  filed complaints seeking federal investigations into allegations that the company violated federal election law In an article that detailed how Cambridge Analytica obtained information about millions of Facebook users  The New York Times reported this month that employees of the data research firm with European or Canadian citizenship had worked extensively for its American clients during the 2014 and 2016 elections  despite a warning from its own election lawyer The employees worked on polling  message development  and the designing of target audiences for digital ads and fund raising appeals The company said the work was permissible because none of the foreign employees had  strategic  or  operational  roles  But former employees contradicted that account  suggesting that the work violated laws in the United States that strictly limit what non Americans can do for American political campaigns Common Cause filed one complaint with the Justice Department  which has authority to investigate  knowing and willful  violations of campaign law  The group also filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission  which has day to day jurisdiction over enforcing election rules  It defies belief that even after their own attorney warned them that they would be violating the prohibition on performing certain election related activities in U S  elections that they did so anyway   said Paul S  Ryan  Common Cause s vice president for policy and litigation In the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco  lawyers appealed two lawsuits that challenged the social media company s privacy and user data policies  One lawsuit claims that Facebook violates the Electronic Communications Privacy Act  Wiretap Act  and state law equivalents because of the way it monitors its users on and off the platform The second suit claims that Facebook has been capturing and selling the details of users  browsing of third party health sites  Any site with a Facebook  like  button  including those of medical institutions such as the American Cancer Society and the American Society of Clinical Oncology  could be used to track users as they browsed outside Facebook  according to the lawsuit Facebook also has been targeted by several shareholder lawsuits since the reports detailing Cambridge Analytica s use of Facebook user information Many users have threatened to deactivate or delete their accounts to protest Facebook s stewardship of their personal data  The  deletefacebook campaign  as it has been called  has even received support from a creator of WhatsApp  one of Facebook s most popular services  who sold his company to the social media giant for  19 billion in 2014  Elon Musk  the chief executive of SpaceX and Tesla  removed the Facebook pages of both companies on Friday While the Cambridge Analytica revelations have renewed regulatory interest in Facebook in the United States  pressure on the company in other countries has been building for years The company has been the subject of several privacy investigations and charges by European regulators  And Europe has approved a new privacy law  which takes effect in May  that will give users of Facebook  Google and other internet services more control over how their data is collected and what Silicon Valley companies know about them 
  Want to get this briefing by email  Here s the sign up  Good morning Here s what you need to know   Mark Zuckerberg  the social media giant s chief executive  publicly addressed the crisis facing his company  five days after reports about the misuse of data from 50 million of its users  We also made mistakes  there s more to do  and we need to step up and do it   he wrote in a statement outlining the steps Facebook would take to better protect users  information  He also spoke to The Times about his plans for change Given that the gathering of user data is fundamental to the company s operations  lawmakers and researchers were unimpressed by Mr  Zuckerberg s mea culpa   He avoided the big issue  which is that for many years  Facebook was basically giving away user data like it

Eisenstadt v  Baird that it s unconstitutional for a state to deny unmarried people access to contraception The court had ruled earlier  in 1965  that state bans on contraceptives for married couples violated their privacy rights  But a few states still restricted access for single people Bill Baird  an activist  violated one such law in Massachusetts  He appealed his conviction to the Supreme Court  which struck down the law Justice William Brennan held that the law violated the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment because it discriminated between married and unmarried people The case became an important precedent for landmark rulings by the Supreme Court  including the 1973 decision in Roe v  Wade that recognized abortion rights  and  more recently  the 2015 decision guaranteeing a right to same sex marriage A movie about Mr  Baird s case is in development Mr  Baird has continued working as an activist  but his legacy is complicated by what The Times described in 1993 as an  unapologetic zealotry  and a willingness to criticize  even his ideologic allies   Planned Parenthood once called him an  embarrassment  Jillian Rayfield contributed reporting      Your

Good morning  Want to get California Today by email  Here s the sign up  More than 10 years ago  Arnold Schwarzenegger  then the Republican governor of California  told an audience of conservative leaders that the California Republican Party had moved too far to the right and was  dying at the box office   How right I was   Mr  Schwarzenegger said in a rare return public appearance on Wednesday   The party was going down and down and down  Today we are the Titanic after it hit the iceberg   but before the last bit of the ship submerged  Mr  Schwarzenegger was speaking at a youth center in East Los Angeles marking the start of an organization of moderate California Republicans trying to move the way out of power state party to the center   and back  organizers said  into being a player in state governance  The organization is called New Way California and was put together by Assemblyman Chad Mayes  who was ousted as the Republican minority leader after voting with Democrats on extending the cap and trade automobile emission program  We seek to shed the stereotype of the intolerant Republican Party that serves only the rich and big business   Mr  Mayes said Mr  Schwarzenegger was not the only Republican firepower on stage  John Kasich  the governor of Ohio  who is considering challenging President Trump for the Republican nomination in 2020  was also on hand In Sacramento  the former governor   and occasional actor   broke with national Republicans  at least of today  when he championed environmental protection efforts  including stringent emission controls  In sentiments also reflected by Mr  Kasich and Mr  Mayes  Mr  Schwarzenegger said the Republican Party had to be  environmentally progressive  socially liberal and fiscally conservative  in order to be competitive  Our party is giving them Twitter fights instead of answers   Mr  Schwarzenegger said   And it is sinking us  It is time to return to the issues   The politics of division and anger and resentment can drive a strong base to the polls  yes   he said   But it is tearing our country apart at the seams  And nothing is getting done   Please note  We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers    Mark Zuckerberg on whether he s concerned about Facebook users deleting their accounts   I think it s a clear signal that this is a major trust issue for people  and I understand that  And whether people delete their app over it or just don t feel good about using Facebook  that s a big issue that I think we have a responsibility to rectify   Full interview   You can quit Facebook if you simply find no joy in it  But if you re looking to leave for philosophical reasons concerning privacy  it s a futile effort  You may be better

Revelations that a voter profiling company that worked Donald J  Trump s presidential campaign harvested private information from 50 million Facebook profiles have many people wondering  What  if anything  can they do to protect their data connected to the social network Here s the harsh truth  Not much  short of ceasing to browse the web entirely or deleting your Facebook account Yet there are some best practices you can employ to help safeguard your data  such as installing software to block web tracking technologies and carefully vetting the apps that you use on Facebook But it also helps to understand what exactly happened with those 50 million profiles in order to determine how you can better protect your data  Here s what you need to know An academic researcher at Cambridge University built an app called thisisyourdigitallife  which offered to pay Facebook users to take a personality test and agree to share that data for academic use  About 270 000 people participated in the study   enough to extract information on tens of millions of Facebooks users How did Cambridge Analytica get data on 50 million people when only 270 000 people had agreed to hand over their information to a third party  Facebook said people who downloaded the app gave consent for the app to collect limited information about their friends whose privacy settings were set to allow it That information was eventually paid for by Cambridge Analytica  the voter profiling company that worked with the Trump campaign There is a multipronged approach you can take to protect yourself from data harvesting apps and programs  That includes tools you can install in your browser and settings you can tweak on Facebook  Here s a run down of what you should do   Audit your Facebook apps  If you used Facebook to sign in to a third party website  game or app  those services may continue to access your personal data  On Facebook  go to the settings page and click on the Apps tab to see which apps are connected to your account  From there  you can take a closer look at the permissions you granted to each app to see what information you are sharing  Remove any apps that you find suspicious or no longer use   Facebook has also made some changes to prevent the gathering of detailed information of friends of users  On the App Settings page there is another setting called Apps Others Use  This is where you choose which details are shared about you when your friends use apps  Make sure to uncheck all the boxes if you don t want any of your information  like your birthday or hometown  accessed by your friends  apps   Audit your Facebook privacy settings  If you are concerned about what details apps can see about you and your Facebook friends  now is a good time to check your privacy settings and minimize the information you share publicly  For example  you can make sure that only your friends can see your Facebook posts  or that only you can see your friends list   Read privacy policies  When you sign up for a new app or web tool  the company typically asks you to agree to its terms of service  Make it a habit to peruse the terms and pay particular attention to the privacy policy  If you see language that suggests your data could be shared in a way that makes you uncomfortable  don t use the program   Install a tracker blocker  There are add ons that you can install in your browser that try to block trackers embedded on websites  But be aware that in some cases  they will make parts of websites work improperly  In our tests  Disconnect and Privacy Badger were useful tools for blocking trackers on Google s Chrome browser Here s a primer on how tracking works  to give you a sense of why blockers are important  When you engage with an app on Facebook  it may plant a tracker in your web browser  like a cookie  that collects information from you  Even when you close out of the app  the tracker can continue to follow your activities  like the other sites you visit or the people you interact with through status updates  according to Michael Priem  chief executive of Modern Impact  an advertising firm in Minneapolis  It doesn t go away after you ve stopped looking at the ad   he said   Install an ad blocker  Another way to block trackers is to prevent ads from loading altogether  Ad blockers are also add ons that you can install for your browser on your mobile device or computer  Mobile ads are fully functioning programs  and they sometimes include malware that harvest some of your data  Even the largest websites do not have tight control over the ads that appear on their sites   and sometimes malicious code can appear inside their ad networks  A popular ad blocker among security researchers is uBlock Origin   Clear your browsing data  Periodically  you can clear your cookies and browsing history  Apple  Google and Microsoft have published instructions on how to clear data for their browsers Safari  Chrome and Internet Explorer  That will temporarily delete cookies and trackers  though they will probably reappear over time   Be wary of unknown brands  Even if you read the privacy policies  you still may have to take them with a grain of salt  In the case of the thisisyourdigitallife app  the fine print said the information would be collected for academic use  not commercial purposes  So think twice before sharing information with unfamiliar companies or organizations   Then again  the researcher came from Cambridge University  one of the world s top schools   so who can you really trust  
Good Wednesday  Here s what we re watching   Mark Zuckerberg has broken his silence on the Cambridge Analytica crisis   Why driverless cars are essential to Uber s future   Jerome Powell s first Federal Reserve meeting as chairman   Pete Peterson  the co founder of Blackstone and a former chairman of Lehman Brothers  has died   Facebook and other tech companies might need a new privacy regulator   How companies are pressing for tariff exemptions Get this in your inbox each morning  Sign up here Facebook s chief executive posted a statement on his Facebook page  saying he was taking action to prevent people s data on the social network from being misused  We have a responsibility to protect your data  and if we can t then we don t deserve to serve you   Mr  Zuckerberg wrote   I ve been working to understand exactly what happened and how to make sure this doesn t happen again  Here are the steps the company is taking to address the issue    We will investigate all apps that had access to large amounts of information before we changed our platform to dramatically reduce data access in 2014  and we will conduct a full audit of any app with suspicious activity     We will restrict developers  data access even further to prevent other kinds of abuse     We want to make sure you understand which apps you ve allowed to access your data  In the next month  we will show everyone a tool at the top of your News Feed with the apps you ve used and an easy way to revoke those apps  permissions to your data  Mr  Zuckerberg had drawn criticism for his response to how Cambridge Analytica improperly obtained data on 50 million Facebook users  In the days since the news first broke this weekend  he had not commented publicly on the crisis That contrasts with how other tech chief executives have addressed crises at their firms Kevin Roose and Sheera Frenkel of the NYT report So why did it take so long for Mr  Zuckerberg to respond  Kate Losse  an early Facebook employee and Mr  Zuckerberg s former speechwriter  told the NYT   My guess is that what is giving Zuckerberg pause at this point is the question of how to acknowledge and explain this state of affairs while at the same time mitigating the concerns that will come from people finally understanding how this all worked  Peter Eavis s take  There was something missing from Mark Zuckerberg s response   a full explanation of why Facebook took so long to disclose the misuse of its data  As Mr  Zuckerberg noted  Facebook found out in 2015 that Aleksandr Kogan had violated company policies by sharing user data with Cambridge Analytica  Facebook users might ask why the abuse wasn t disclosed at the time  Often it has taken pressure from outsiders to get Facebook to reveal abuses of its network  An alternative approach would have been for Facebook to proactively disclose as much information as possible about the wrongdoing  Facebook users would most likely welcome a strong commitment from Mr  Zuckerberg to do just that The Federal Reserve  as widely expected  raised interest rates on Wednesday by a quarter of a percentage point  The bigger questions were about the strength of the economy and pace of future rate increases On those matters  the Federal Reserve has expressed more confidence in the strength of the economy Dot plot  Fed officials signaled they would raise rates at a quicker pace over the next three years  Policymakers now expect to hike rates three times this year  three times in 2019 and twice in 2020  At its December meeting  policymakers expected three rate hikes this year  but just two in 2019 Economic projections  Officials raised their median estimates for economic growth this year to 2 7 percent  up from 2 5 percent in December  Fed policymakers also expect inflation to run above 2 percent by 2019 and 2020 Mr  Powell s news conference  The new Fed chairman expressed optimism about the current economic picture and said officials were trying to strike a balance between raising rates too slowly or too quickly   We re trying to take that middle ground  Mr  Powell left the door open to more or fewer than three increases this year  depending on economic conditions   Like any set of forecasts  those forecasts will change over time   he said   It could change up  It could change down On inflation  he added   There is no sense in the data that we re on the cusp of an acceleration of inflation  We have seen moderate increases in wages and price inflation  And we seem to be seeing more of that  The answer has to do with car ownership  For years  Uber and its rivals have promoted the idea that people living in urban areas will turn to Uber to get to and from work and to run errands rather than buy a car If Uber can become an alternative to car ownership  that would greatly increase its potential market A study last year from the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute  Texas A M Transportation Institute  and Columbia University suggested that people might make the switch But for people give up their cars  the cost of using Uber would most likely have to fall far below current levels  The need for this drop in costs came up when Dara Khosrowshahi  the C E O  of Uber  recently sat down for an interview with David Solomon  president and C O O  of Goldman Sachs Here s the write up of the autonomous car portion of their conversation in a recent Goldman note to clients The pedestrian fatality in Arizona is perhaps Dara Khosrowshahi s first major test as Uber s C E O   leaving him with a difficult choice  keep

For much of the past week  Facebook has been embroiled in a controversy involving Cambridge Analytica  a political consulting firm with ties to Donald J  Trump s 2016 presidential campaign  and how the firm improperly obtained and exploited personal data from 50 million Facebook users On Wednesday  following widespread questions about his whereabouts  Mark Zuckerberg  the chief executive of Facebook  spoke with two New York Times reporters  Sheera Frenkel and Kevin Roose  about the controversy and the steps he was taking to make the social network less prone to abuse Below is a transcript of the conversation  edited for length and clarity Sheera Frenkel  Did it come as a surprise to you  the user response to the news that Cambridge Analytica had accessed this trove of data Mark Zuckerberg  Privacy issues have always been incredibly important to people  One of our biggest responsibilities is to protect data  If you think about what our services are  at their most basic level  you put some content into a service  whether it s a photo or a video or a text message   whether it s Facebook or WhatsApp or Instagram   and you re trusting that that content is going to be shared with the people you want to share it with  Whenever there s an issue where someone s data gets passed to someone who the rules of the system shouldn t have allowed it to  that s rightfully a big issue and deserves to be a big uproar Frenkel  It took quite a few days for your response to come out  Is that because you were weighing these three action points that you noted in your post Zuckerberg  The first thing is  I really wanted to make sure we had a full and accurate understanding of everything that happened  I know that there was a lot of pressure to speak sooner  but my assessment was that it was more important that what we said was fully accurate The second thing is  the most important thing is that we fix this system so that issues like this don t happen again  It s not like there aren t going to be other different kind of things we ll also have to fix  But when there s a certain problem  we have a responsibility to at least make sure we resolve that problem So the actions here that we re going to do involve first  dramatically reducing the amount of data that developers have access to  so that apps and developers can t do what Kogan did here  The most important actions there we actually took three or four years ago  in 2014  But when we examined the systems this week  there were certainly other things we felt we should lock down  too  So we re going ahead and doing that Even if you solve the problem going forward  there s still this issue of  Are there other Cambridge Analyticas out there  or other Kogans who  when the platform worked a certain way in the past  were there apps which could have gotten access to more information  and potentially sold it without us knowing  or done something that violated people s trust  We also need to make sure we get that under control  That s why we spent a lot of time figuring out  O K  here s what it s going to take to do a full investigation of every app that got access to a large amount of information before we changed the platform policies to dramatically reduce the data access that developers had  For any app that we uncover that has any suspicious activity  we re going to go do a full forensic audit  and make sure we have the capacity to do that  to make sure that other developers aren t doing what Kogan did here The third thing is  it s really important that people know what apps they ve authorized  A lot of people have been on Facebook now for five or 10 years  and sometimes you signed into an app a long time ago and you may have forgotten about that  So one of the steps we re taking is making it so apps can no longer access data after you haven t used them for three months But it s also just really important to put in front of people a tool of  here are all the apps you ve connected to and authorized  here s an easy way to deauthorize them  to revoke their permission to get access to your activity Kevin Roose  Is Facebook planning to notify the 50 million users whose data was shared with Cambridge Analytica Zuckerberg  Yes  We re going to tell anyone whose data may have been shared Now  there s a question of whether we have the exact record in our systems today of who your friends were on that day when there was access three and a half or four years ago  so we re going to be conservative on that and try to tell anyone whose data may have been affected  even if we don t know for certain that they were  It s likely that we ll build a tool like we did with the Russian misinformation investigation  that anyone can go to it and see if their data was affected by this Roose  Do you have a preliminary estimate of how many apps you ll be investigating Zuckerberg  It will be in the thousands Frenkel  Were those app developers notified that you ll be investigating this yet Zuckerberg  Just when I posted  And we ll be reaching out in the near term Frenkel  Are you going to be hiring people to help conduct those investigations Zuckerberg  Yes  I would imagine we re going to have to grow the team to work on this Roose  You mentioned a contract that developers will have to sign in order to ask anyone for access to broader profile information  What will be the terms of that contract  and what will be the penalties for violating it Zuckerberg  So  the important thing there is that it s a high touch process  The specific point we were trying to make is that it s not going to be some terms of service that a developer can sign up for just on their computer when developing something  I guess technically  that would be a contract as well The point of what we re trying to do here is to create a situation where we have a real person to person relationship with any developer who is asking for the most sensitive data  That doesn t mean that   if you re a developer and you want to put Facebook Login on your website  you can do that  If you want to get access to ask people for their religious affiliation  or their sexual orientation  for data that could be very sensitive  we want to make sure we have a clear relationship with those people Frenkel  We understood that Cambridge Analytica had reached out to Facebook and asked that its ban on the platform be reconsidered  Are you giving any thought to allowing Cambridge Analytica back in Zuckerberg  The first thing we need to do is conduct this full forensic audit of the firm  that they don t have any people s data from our community and that they ve deleted anything  including derivative data  that they might have  We re working with the regulator in the U K  on this  so our forensic audit was actually paused in the near term to cede the way for the ICO there to do their own government investigation  We re certainly not going to consider letting them back onto the platform until we have full confirmation that there s no wrongdoing here Roose  There were reports as far back as 2015 that Cambridge Analytica had access to this data set  Why didn t you suspend them then Zuckerberg  So  we actually heard  I think it was at the end of 2015   some journalists from The Guardian reached out to us and told us what you just said  And it was not just about Cambridge Analytica  it was about this developer  Aleksandr Kogan  who had shared data with them We took action immediately at that point  We banned Kogan s app from the platform  we demanded that Kogan and Cambridge Analytica and a couple other parties that Kogan had shared the data with would legally certify that they didn t have the data  and weren t using it in any of their operations  They gave us that formal certification  At the time  they told us they never had gotten access to raw Facebook data  so we made that decision Frenkel  In retrospect  do you wish you had demanded proof that the data had been deleted Zuckerberg  Yes  They gave us a formal and legal certification  and it seems at this point that that was false Again  we haven t done our full investigation and audit yet so I can t say definitively that they actually have data  I ve just read all the same reports that you have  including in The New York Times  that says that journalists have seen evidence that they have the data  which is a strong enough signal for us to go on  and take action here That s the basic driver behind us now needing to go and do a full investigation into any app that had access to a large amount of data before we locked down the platform policies in 2014  Just having folks tell us that they were using the data correctly  I think  does not satisfy our responsibility to our community to protect their data Frenkel  Are you actively looking at some of these dark web data brokers that have been in news reports recently  that say that other independent researchers are potentially trading in this data Zuckerberg  Yes  we re investigating that too Roose  Are you worried about the  DeleteFacebook campaign that s been going around  Have you seen meaningful numbers of people deleting their accounts  and are you worried that will be a trend Zuckerberg  I don t think we ve seen a meaningful number of people act on that  but  you know  it s not good  I think it s a clear signal that this is a major trust issue for people  and I understand that  And whether people delete their app over it or just don t feel good about using Facebook  that s a big issue that I think we have a responsibility to rectify Frenkel  We re now heading into the 2018 midterms  Could you speak about what Facebook is going to do ahead of the 2018 midterms to make people feel more confident that the platform won t be used this way again Zuckerberg  This is an incredibly important point  There s no doubt that in 2016  there were a number of issues including foreign interference and false news that we did not have as much of a handle on as we feel a responsibility to for our community Now  the good news here is that these problems aren t necessarily rocket science  They re hard  but they re things that if you invest and work on making it harder for adversaries to do what they re trying to do  you can really reduce the amount of false news  make it harder for foreign governments to interfere One of the things that gives me confidence is that we ve seen a number of elections at this point where this has gone a lot better  In the months after the 2016 election  there was the French election  The new A I  tools we built after the 2016 elections found  I think  more than 30 000 fake accounts that we believe were linked to Russian sources who were trying to do the same kind of tactics they did in the U S  in the 2016 election  We were able to disable them and prevent that from happening on a large scale in France In last year  in 2017 with the special election in Alabama  we deployed some new A I  tools to identify fake accounts and false news  and we found a significant number of Macedonian accounts that were trying to spread false news  and were able to eliminate those  And that  actually  is something I haven t talked about publicly before  so you re the first people I m telling about that I feel a lot better about the systems now  At the same time  I think Russia and other governments are going to get more sophisticated in what they do  too  So we need to make sure that we up our game  This is a massive focus for us to make sure we re dialed in for not only the 2018 elections in the U S   but the Indian elections  the Brazilian elections  and a number of other elections that are going on this year that are really important Frenkel  The Times reported that  Facebook chief security officer Alex  Stamos will be leaving toward the end of this year  Is there a broader plan for how Facebook is going to structure security on its platform ahead of all these important elections Zuckerberg  Sure  One of the important things we ve done is  we want to unify all of our security efforts  And you reported on a reorg around Alex Stamos  and I ll say something about him in a second  He s been a very valuable contributor here and was a really central figure in helping us identify the foreign interference with Russia  And I think he has done very good work  and I m hopeful he ll be engaged for a while here on that One of the big things we needed to do is coordinate our efforts a lot better across the whole company  It s not all A I   right  There s certainly a lot that A I  can do  we can train classifiers to identify content  but most of what we do is identify things that people should look at  So we re going to double the amount of people working on security this year  We ll have more than 20 000 people working on security and community operations by the end of the year  I think we have about 15 000 now  So it s really the technical systems we have working with the people in our operations functions that make the biggest deal The last thing I d add on this  Take things like false news  You know  a lot of it is really spam  if you think about it  It s the same people who might have been sending you Viagra emails in the  90s  now they re trying to come up with sensational content and push it into Facebook and other apps in order to get you to click on it and see ads  There are some pretty basic policy decisions we ve made  like O K   if you re anywhere close to being a fake news site  you can t put Facebook ads on your site  right  So then suddenly  it becomes harder for them to make money  If you make it hard enough for them to make money  they just kind of go and do something else Roose  Is the basic economic model of Facebook  in which users provide data that Facebook uses to help advertisers and developers to better target potential customers and users   do you feel like that works  given what we now know about the risks Zuckerberg  Yeah  so this is a really important question  The thing about the ad model that is really important that aligns with our mission is that   our mission is to build a community for everyone in the world and to bring the world closer together  And a really important part of that is making a service that people can afford  A lot of the people  once you get past the first billion people  can t afford to pay a lot  Therefore  having it be free and have a business model that is ad supported ends up being really important and aligned Now  over time  might there be ways for people who can afford it to pay a different way  That s certainly something we ve thought about over time  But I don t think the ad model is going to go away  because I think fundamentally  it s important to have a service like this that everyone in the world can use  and the only way to do that is to have it be very cheap or free Roose  Adam Mosseri  Facebook s head of News Feed  recently said he had lost some sleep over Facebook s role in the violence in Myanmar  You ve said you re  outraged  about what happened with Cambridge Analytica  but when you think about the many things that are happening with Facebook all over the world  are you losing any sleep  Do you feel any guilt about the role Facebook is playing in the world Zuckerberg  That s a good question  I think  you know  we re doing something here which is unprecedented  in terms of building a community for people all over the world to be able to share what matters to them  and connect across boundaries  I think what we re seeing is  there are new challenges that I don t think anyone had anticipated before If you had asked me  when I got started with Facebook  if one of the central things I d need to work on now is preventing governments from interfering in each other s elections  there s no way I thought that s what I d be doing  if we talked in 2004 in my dorm room I don t know that it s possible to know every issue that you re going to face down the road  But we have a real responsibility to take all these issues seriously as they come up  and work with experts and people around the world to make sure we solve them  and do a good job for our community It s certainly true that  over the course of Facebook  I ve made all kinds of different mistakes  whether that s technical mistakes or business mistakes or hiring mistakes  We ve launched product after product that didn t work  I spend most of my time looking forward  trying to figure out how to solve the issues that people are having today  because I think that s what people in our community would want 
WASHINGTON   The political action committee founded by John R  Bolton  President Trump s incoming national security adviser  was one of the earliest customers of Cambridge Analytica  which it hired specifically to develop psychological profiles of voters with data harvested from tens of millions of Facebook profiles  according to former Cambridge employees and company documents Mr  Bolton s political committee  known as The John Bolton Super PAC  first hired Cambridge in August 2014  months after the political data firm was founded and while it was still harvesting the Facebook data In the two years that followed  Mr  Bolton s super PAC spent nearly  1 2 million primarily for  survey research   which is a term that campaigns use for polling  according to campaign finance records But the contract between the political action committee and Cambridge  a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times  offers more detail on just what Mr  Bolton was buying  The contract broadly describes the services to be delivered by Cambridge as  behavioral microtargeting with psychographic messaging  To do that work  Cambridge used Facebook data  according to the documents and two former employees familiar with the work  The data and modeling Bolton s PAC received was derived from the Facebook data   said Christopher Wylie  a data expert who was part of the team that founded Cambridge Analytica   We definitely told them about how we were doing it  We talked about it in conference calls  in meetings  Cambridge Analytica  which rose to prominence through its work with Mr  Trump s 2016 election campaign  has found itself confronting a deepening crisis since reports this past weekend in The New York Times and The Observer of London that the firm had harvested the data from more than 50 million Facebook profiles in its bid to develop techniques for predicting the behavior of individual American voters Cambridge s so called psychographic modeling techniques  which were built in part with the data harvested from Facebook  underpinned its work for Mr  Trump s campaign in 2016  setting off a furious   and still unsettled   debate about whether the firm s technology worked  The same techniques were also the focus of its work for Mr  Bolton s super PAC  The Bolton PAC was obsessed with how America was becoming limp wristed and spineless and it wanted research and messaging for national security issues   Mr  Wylie said  That really meant making people more militaristic in their worldview   he added   That s what they said they wanted  anyway  Using the psychographic models  Cambridge helped design concepts for advertisements for candidates supported by Mr  Bolton s PAC  including the 2014 campaign of Thom Tillis  the Republican senator from North Carolina  according to Mr  Wylie and another former employee  who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid being dragged into the investigations that now appear to be engulfing Cambridge One advertisement  a video that was posted on YouTube  was aimed at people who scored high for conscientiousness  and were thought to respect hard work and experience  It emphasized Mr  Bolton s time working for Ronald Reagan and how Mr  Tillis embodied the spirit and political ethos of the late president Beyond their conservative politics  Mr  Trump  Mr  Bolton and Cambridge Analytica all share a patron   the Mercer family of Long Island  whose patriarch  Robert L  Mercer  made a fortune at the helm of a top yielding hedge fund Cambridge Analytica  which grew out of the London based SCL Group  was founded in 2014 with a  15 million investment from Mr  Mercer  whose daughter Rebekah sits on the firm s board of directors  Stephen K  Bannon was also a co founder At the same time  Mr  Mercer was financially supporting Mr  Bolton s PAC  donating  5 million between April 2014 and September 2016  according to Federal Election Commission filings  The Mercers also backed Mr  Trump in the presidential election The Mercer family has not publicly commented since the reports about the misuse of Facebook data by Cambridge first surfaced in The Times and The Observer The reports have prompted calls from lawmakers in Britain and the United States for renewed scrutiny of Facebook  and at least two American state prosecutors have said they are looking into the misuse of data by Cambridge Analytica The company also suspended its chief executive  Alexander Nix  after a television broadcast this week in which he was recorded suggesting that the company had used seduction and bribery to entrap politicians and influence foreign elections But it is the harvesting of Facebook data that has cast the harshest spotlight on Cambridge  and Mr  Bolton s experience with the company appears to have provided a model for how it sold itself to future political campaigns  including Mr  Trump s The firm took the psychographic profiles it was building off the Facebook data at the time and combined them with voter databases and other sets of data  Staff from SCL s elections division  which through a convoluted corporate structure was interchangeable with Cambridge  discussed what they were doing at a meeting in July 2014 with another contractor for the Bolton PAC  according to an agenda of the meeting obtained by The Times The profiles would be used to  identify the personality traits of individuals  in states to be targeted by the Bolton PAC  said the agenda  which was prepared for SCL and Cambridge staff   Individuals can be targeted with the right message   it said The agenda also included a line  in boldfaced text  that said SCL wanted to use voter contact lists available to Bolton s campaign to direct people  toward the FB app   Cambridge  working through an outside researcher  used a Facebook app to harvest data from the social network s profiles  The app claimed to be collecting data for academic research  and users were not aware of its true purpose Months later  the relationship between Cambridge and the Bolton PAC had grown so close that the firm was writing up talking points for Mr  Bolton  In an email dated Oct  1  2014  Cambridge staff outlined a few sentences that Mr  Bolton could use to describe the work the new firm was doing for his super PAC  It s not just about how much you spend  It s also about how smart you spend   the email advised Mr  Bolton to say  One way we re doing that is by enlisting an outside firm    Cambridge Analytica    to provide deepdive research into who makes up our audience of target voters   it continued   We are producing ads specifically designed for voters of a certain personality and demographic profile  So if you re a young woman in New Hampshire with a specific kind of personality and a particular set of issues that you care about  our research allows us to connect with that voter in a way that truly resonates with her  The subject line of the email   Did Bannon come back to you on this  
LONDON   The whistle blower Christopher Wylie held a roomful of British lawmakers rapt for three and a half hours on Tuesday  like a pink haired  nose ringed oracle sent from the future to explain data In testimony to the House of Commons  select committee on culture  Mr  Wylie  a 28 year old Canadian  described the inner workings of SCL  a political consultancy that gave its clients access to a vast collection of personal information harvested from Facebook In one of the longest sessions in recent memory  Mr  Wylie made a number of jaw dropping assertions  most significantly that the company s exploitation of personal data had swung the results of Britain s 2016 referendum on leaving the European Union  He also suggested that his predecessor at Cambridge Analytica was murdered But mostly  Mr  Wylie tried to explain data mining  He looked like a cerebral skate rat  which might in other circumstances have undermined his credibility  but in this case it seemed to help  He was polite  He resembled  as one journalist put it   a patient grandson trying to set up a Skype call with his gran  His message was clear  If you aren t already worried about how your personal data is being used  now would be a good time to start   The way I like to think of it  data is the electricity of our new economy  and electricity can be quite dangerous   he said   We enjoy the benefits of electricity  despite the fact that it can literally kill you  Cambridge Analytica released a statement describing Mr  Wylie as  a part time contractor who left in July 2014 and has no direct knowledge of our work or practices since then   It said Cambridge Analytica  a subsidiary of the SCL political consultancy  did not use its cache of data in Donald J  Trump s 2016 campaign  and had no involvement in the European Union referendum that ended with a victory for those who support withdrawal  or Brexit  from the bloc Mr  Wylie s testimony bluntly contradicted that of his former boss  Alexander Nix  who has recently appeared before the same committee twice  Mr  Wylie said a cluster of pro Brexit organizations employed a Canadian subsidiary company  Aggregate IQ  which provided them with SCL s store of data  I think it is completely reasonable to say that there could have been a different outcome of the referendum had there not been  in my view  cheating   he said He also suggested that Russian intelligence agencies could have easily scooped up the company s vast library of data on American voters in advance of the 2016 elections in the United States  because Aleksandr Kogan  the scientist who collected it  made regular return trips to Russia  Put a key logger in Kogan s computer in Russia and you ve got everything   Mr  Wylie said  He added   It would make it incredibly easy for them to get access to this data  For me  that s concerning and I think it should be looked into  Mr  Wylie s appearance has coincided with a surge of collective dismay over data mining  and many found themselves riveted by his testimony on Tuesday  Georgia Rakusen  33  a user researcher at a technology firm in London  urged her Twitter followers to tune into the hearing  which she called  absolutely gripping stuff  His testimony  she said   was something that  as a lay person  you could watch and start to grasp the enormity of how your data is used   I think maybe people are just beginning to open up  to realize that maybe it s not just about ads  maybe it s not just what bands I like   she said  Ms  Rakusen  who described her own work as  a space where we are supposed to make people click more   said she hoped that employees of large technology companies would come forward more  looking at whistle blowers like Mr  Wylie and Edward J  Snowden  I didn t watch the whole three and a half hours   she said   But I basically didn t get any other work done during that time  Mr  Wylie  who has described himself a  gay Canadian vegan   dropped out of high school but discovered a genius for coding and  still in his teens  began working for political campaigns  He came close to losing his composure at only one moment on Tuesday  when he was asked what prompted him to turn against the technology he had helped create  He said his views had changed when Mr  Trump was elected  It was no longer this niche  shady firm   he said   It was a firm that was making a massive impact on the world  It s a process of coming to terms with what you have created  and the impact that has had   I am incredibly remorseful for my role in setting it up   he added  his voice wavering   I m the first person to say that I should have known better  But what s done is done  He was caustic on the subject of his former boss  Mr  Nix  who he said enjoyed the colonial challenge of manipulating the affairs of less developed countries  He recalled that once  they were late to a meeting because Mr  Nix had to collect a chandelier he had bought for  283 000  You have to remember that a lot of these people are very wealthy already   he said   The thing that I learned is for certain wealthy people  they need something to keep them occupied  They need projects  And for certain wealthy people  going into the developing world and running a country is something that appeals to them  At times  he seemed slightly pitying of British officials who are investigating data mining  saying they did not have enough resources and lacked a  robust technical background   I have had to explain and re explain and re explain and re explain  you know  how relational databases work  what is an eigenvector  what is dimensionality reduction   he said  They have been working really  really hard  But as a point of observation  one of the weak points that I ve seen   again  this is an empathetic criticism   is the lack of technical people   he said  apparently searching for a polite way to say it   They have had to ask me a lot of questions that a database engineer would not ask  
NEW YORK    Facebook s CEO apologized for the Cambridge Analytica scandal with ads in multiple U S  and British newspapers Sunday  saying the social media platform doesn t deserve to hold personal information if it can t protect it The ads signed by Mark Zuckerberg said a quiz app built by a Cambridge University researcher leaked Facebook data of millions of people four years ago   This was a breach of trust  and I m sorry we didn t do more at the time  We re now taking steps to make sure this doesn t happen again   the ads said Facebook s privacy practices have come under fire after Cambridge Analytica  a political consulting firm affiliated with President Donald Trump s 2016 election campaign  got data inappropriately  The firm is alleged to have created psychological profiles to influence how people vote or even think about politics and society Facebook s stock value has dropped more than  70 billion since the revelations were first published Among the newspapers with the ads were The New York Times and The Washington Post in the U S  and The Sunday Times and The Sunday Telegraph in the United Kingdom The ads said Facebook is limiting the data apps receive when users sign in  It s also investigating every app that had access to large amounts of data   We expect there are others  And when we find them  we will ban them and tell everyone affected   the ads stated Zuckerberg closed the ads by saying   I promise to do better for you  Cambridge Analytica got the data from a researcher who paid 270 000 Facebook users to complete a psychological profile quiz back in 2014  But the quiz gathered information on their friends as well  bringing the total number of people affected to about 50 million The Trump campaign paid the firm  6 million during the 2016 election  although it has since distanced itself from Cambridge 
LONDON    Britain s information regulator said Saturday it was assessing evidence gathered from a raid on the office of data mining firm Cambridge Analytica  part of an investigation into alleged misuse of personal information by political campaigns and social media companies like Facebook More than a dozen investigators from the Information Commissioner s Office entered the company s central London office late Friday  shortly after a High Court judge granted a warrant  The investigators were seen leaving the premises early Saturday after spending about seven hours searching the office The regulator said it will  consider the evidence before deciding the next steps and coming to any conclusions   This is one part of a larger investigation by the ICO into the use of personal data and analytics by political campaigns  parties  social media companies and other commercial actors   it said Authorities in Britain as well as the U S  are investigating Cambridge Analytica over allegations the firm improperly obtained data from 50 million Facebook users and used it to manipulate elections  including the 2016 White House race and the 2016 Brexit vote in Britain Both Cambridge Analytica and Facebook deny wrongdoing The data firm suspended its CEO Alexander Nix this week after Britain s Channel 4 News broadcast footage that appeared to show Nix suggesting tactics like entrapment or bribery that his company could use to discredit politicians  The footage also showed Nix saying Cambridge Analytica played a major role in securing Donald Trump s victory in the 2016 U S  presidential election Cambridge Analytica s acting chief executive  Alexander Tayler  said Friday that he was sorry that SCL Elections  an affiliate of his company   licensed Facebook data and derivatives from a research company  Global Science Research  that had not received consent from most respondents  in 2014  The company believed that the data had been obtained in line with Facebook s terms of service and data protection laws   Tayler said His statement said the data was deleted in 2015 at Facebook s request  and denied that any of the Facebook data that Cambridge Analytica obtained was used in the work it did on the 2016 U S  election

NEW DELHI    India has set a March 31 deadline for London based political consultancy Cambridge Analytica to respond to a query on whether it was engaged to improperly harvest Facebook data on Indian citizens  the information technology ministry said India s information technology minister last week warned against any abuse of social media in elections  following reports that the analytics firm improperly accessed information on millions of Facebook users to target U S  voters Friday s notice to the firm followed local media reports that Indian political parties had used the data analytics firm during elections India is preparing for a general election in 2019 and several states will elect new assemblies this year and the next  The fairness of Indian democracy and electoral process is a matter of pride and any attempt to influence the sanctity of the electoral franchise through dubious and questionable means is unacceptable   the ministry said in a statement Attempts by Reuters to seek comment from the firm  via social media  went unanswered The ministry raised six questions in its notice  from whether the firm had engaged in profiling based on the data collected  to how the data was used and if consent had been secured from the concerned individuals The government was deeply concerned with allegations that data could have been used to influence people s behavior  the ministry said The ministry has threatened to take legal action against companies and individuals engaging in any unauthorized use of such data  Reporting by Malini Menon  Editing by Clarence Fernandez

SAN FRANCISCO   Facebook s chief executive  Mark Zuckerberg  on Wednesday publicly addressed for the first time the misuse of data belonging to 50 million users of the social network and described the steps the company would take to safeguard the information of its more than two billion monthly users Although his statement addressing a chorus of criticism fell short of a full throated apology  Mr  Zuckerberg said that Facebook would contact users whose data had been harvested through a personality quiz app and passed along to the political data firm Cambridge Analytica  We have a responsibility to protect your data   Mr  Zuckerberg said Wednesday in a Facebook post   and if we can t then we don t deserve to serve you  Mr  Zuckerberg  33  was trying to quell the crisis over the disclosure last weekend that Cambridge Analytica had used data that had been improperly obtained from Facebook as the firm worked on behalf of Donald J  Trump s presidential campaign  Are there other Cambridge Analyticas out there   Mr  Zuckerberg said later in an interview with The New York Times  He added   Were there apps which could have gotten access to more information and potentially sold it without us knowing or done something that violated people s trust  We also need to make sure we get that under control  Mr  Zuckerberg said the company would investigate apps like the third party quiz app that had previously obtained access to  large amounts of information  from the social network  He also said the company would restrict third party developers  access  We also made mistakes  there s more to do  and we need to step up and do it   he wrote in his Facebook statement The Cambridge Analytica revelations added to the questions that have been raised about Facebook s handling of user data and security  Those questions have only intensified as the company has faced criticism over the role its platform played in Russian attempts to influence the 2016 presidential election and the way it has been used to spread misinformation on the internet The resulting backlash is Facebook s worst crisis since it was founded by Mr  Zuckerberg and others in 2004  The information  photos and other content that users post and their frequent engagement with the platform is crucial to the social network  and to the company s profitability  Questions about user privacy and security threaten the company s standing at a time when people are already uneasy about whether the use of technology can bring good or ill Last Friday  after The New York Times  The Observer of London and Channel 4 in Britain told Facebook that Cambridge Analytica had not deleted all of the data it had obtained  the social network banned the political consulting firm and Aleksandr Kogan  the Cambridge University researcher who created the personality quiz app that was used to harvest user data  This was a breach of trust between Kogan  Cambridge Analytica and Facebook   Mr  Zuckerberg wrote on Wednesday   But it was also a breach of trust between Facebook and the people who share their data with us and expect us to protect it  Facebook representatives confirmed that Cambridge Analytica representatives met with Facebook on Tuesday to discuss lifting the ban  Mr  Zuckerberg told The Times he did not rule out allowing Cambridge Analytica back  saying Facebook must first conduct a  full forensic audit of the firm  and  have full confirmation that there s no wrongdoing here  The reaction to the Cambridge Analytica disclosure has been severe  Politicians in the United States and Britain have called for Mr  Zuckerberg to explain how his company handles user data  and state attorneys general in Massachusetts and New York have begun investigating Cambridge Analytica and Facebook  A  DeleteFacebook movement calling on people to close their accounts has also gathered steam In Washington  there have been more calls for regulation of internet companies like Facebook  Mr  Zuckerberg s troubles there were illustrated by the final passage on Wednesday of a bill to combat sex trafficking  The bill would lift liability protections that internet companies have enjoyed for content that users post on their platforms  Facebook and other internet giants had quietly fought the bill for more than a year  but eventually dropped their opposition Lawmakers who have demanded that Mr  Zuckerberg testify before Congress about Facebook s relationship with Cambridge Analytica were not appeased by his statement  You need to come to Congress and testify to this under oath   Senator Ed Markey  Democrat of Massachusetts  tweeted in response to Mr  Zuckerberg s post Independent researchers who have used data from Facebook said that Mr  Zuckerberg s statement did not acknowledge how the gathering of user data was fundamental to the company s operations  He avoided the big issue  which is that for many years  Facebook was basically giving away user data like it was handing out candy   said Jonathan Albright  research director at the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University   There is no question that handing out that data made Facebook the success it is as a company  This has to be recognized as part of their business model and not just a one off problem  In his statement  Mr  Zuckerberg laid out a timeline of Facebook s dealings with Cambridge Analytica  He traced the information sharing issue to 2007  when Facebook decided to become an open platform   enabling people to use Facebook to log into other apps and share detailed personal information about themselves and their friends In 2013  Mr  Kogan  the Cambridge researcher  created a personality quiz app that about 300 000 people installed  Mr  Zuckerberg wrote  Because Facebook was an open platform  Mr  Kogan was able to collect data on tens of millions of friends of those users who had installed the personality quiz app A year later  Mr  Zuckerberg said  Facebook changed its policy to limit how much data third party apps could access   These actions would prevent any app like Kogan s from being able to access so much data today   he wrote By 2015  Mr  Kogan had shared his data and findings with Cambridge Analytica  which later used the material to single out American voters  Mr  Zuckerberg said Facebook had banned Mr  Kogan s app and demanded that the researcher and Cambridge Analytica formally certify that the data had been deleted  He did not address in his post why Facebook had not already disclosed those activities to its users whose data had been harvested by Mr  Kogan and Cambridge Analytica  Whenever there s an issue where someone s data gets passed to someone who the rules of the system shouldn t have allowed it to  that s rightfully a big issue and deserves to be a big uproar   Mr  Zuckerberg said in the interview For Mr  Zuckerberg  the outcry over Cambridge Analytica has been personally damaging  Inside Facebook  even his staunch supporters have described a tense atmosphere  Some employees have sought to transfer to other divisions  such as the messaging app WhatsApp and the photo sharing platform Instagram  calling their work on Facebook s main product  demoralizing  Mr  Zuckerberg spent part of the past week hunkered down with a small group of engineers to discuss how to make information on Facebook s users more secure  and to potentially give them more control of their data  according to two Facebook employees who declined to be named because the proceedings were confidential His silence on the matter has prompted mounting criticism in the past few days  Facebook held a staff meeting on Tuesday to answer questions about Cambridge Analytica and the surrounding outcry  but Mr  Zuckerberg did not appear at the event  He was scheduled to appear at a staff meeting that was set for Friday In his interview with The Times  Mr  Zuckerberg said that the company s efforts to safeguard its platform from bad behavior   which includes preparing for possible interference attempts in the 2018 midterm elections   were an important part of a larger transformation at the company  which has had to adjust from its roots as a social network for college students into a powerful global information hub  If you had asked me  when I got started with Facebook  if one of the central things I d need to work on now is preventing governments from interfering in each other s elections  there s no way I thought that s what I d be doing if we talked in 2004 in my dorm room   Mr  Zuckerberg said 
LONDON   Two senior advisers to Prime Minister Theresa May might have conspired to bypass electoral spending laws when they were leading a campaign for Britain to leave the European Union  a former employee of their effort said this week  in an interview and in testimony he gave to the country s elections regulator The allegations led to a heated exchange  conducted in the British news media  involving allegations of hard feelings over an old romance and of the deliberate outing by the prime minister s office  No  10 Downing Street  of the former employee as gay The former employee  Shahmir Sanni  said in the interview and in a witness statement submitted to the regulator  the Electoral Commission  that the two advisers had funneled more than  900 000 in campaign spending through a puppet organization that they had set up  They did so  he said  by paying the money to a digital advertising firm that was indirectly linked to the Trump campaign and also worked on the push to exit the European Union Mr  Sanni volunteered at Vote Leave  the main campaign led in part by the two advisers to the prime minister  and then at the organization that he now says was a puppet  called BeLeave  He spoke with The New York Times for a joint reporting project with The Observer of Britain The allegations are the latest of many raised on both sides of the referendum about the possible diversion of money through allied organizations to get around funding limits on each of them  and campaign finance experts said the multitude of such claims pointed to holes and ambiguities in the regulations that governed the referendum In response  one of the two Downing Street advisers  Stephen Parkinson  said that Vote Leave had adhered to all relevant laws  Mr  Parkinson also suggested that Mr  Sanni was lashing out because the two had  dated for 18 months  before splitting up   I thought amicably   in September 2017  He said he had not spoken to Mr  Sanni as a supervisor from the Vote Leave campaign  but as a friend   That is the capacity in which I gave Shahmir advice and encouragement  and I can understand if the lines became blurred for him   Mr  Parkinson said in the statement   but I am clear that I did not direct the activities of any separate campaign groups  The other adviser  Cleo Watson  could not be reached for comment Mr  Sanni said his relationship with Mr  Parkinson had been a short fling that started after the referendum  In a statement  he said the disclosure of his sexual orientation had endangered his family  who live in Pakistan  and he accused Mr  Parkinson of intimidation  I never imagined that he  with the help of No  10  would choose to tell the world I am gay  in a last  desperate attempt to scare me   Mr  Sanni said His lawyer  Tamsin Allen  said in a statement   We believe this is the first time a Downing Street official statement has been used to out someone  British campaign finance experts said the allegations about Vote Leave underscored the porousness and ineffectiveness of rules on spending around referendums like the vote in 2016 to exit the European Union  They were useless   said Justin Fisher  a professor of political science at Brunel University London who has studied the regulations for the Electoral Commission  which oversees elections and regulates political finance in Britain Multiple organizations  each with its own spending limit  were allowed to campaign in parallel on either side of the referendum issue  and they were allowed to work together in ill defined ways  allowing donors on either side many ways to sidestep spending limits  Mr  Fisher noted The rules  had never really been tested before because we never had a referendum of any consequence before   Mr  Fisher said  noting that in total the supporters of remaining in the European Union had outspent the advocates of leaving Mr  Sanni s allegations have come to light because of a tangle of connections to an online consulting company with ties to the campaign that elected President Trump   Cambridge Analytica Mr  Sanni is friends with Christopher Wylie  a former research director of Cambridge Analytica who has recently provided information to journalists indicating that the company improperly obtained  the data of 50 million Facebook users in order to help target voters The Vote Leave campaign relied heavily for online ad placement on a Canadian company called AggregateIQ  which according to documents and testimony submitted to the Electoral Commission by Mr  Wylie was a satellite business set up to support Cambridge Analytica Public filings also show that Vote Leave provided virtually the entire  990 000 budget of BeLeave   625 000 pounds   which took the form of additional spending paid directly to AggregateIQ As Mr  Wylie was coming forward with his disclosures about Cambridge Analytica  he encouraged his friend Mr  Sanni to come forward with his claims about Vote Leave and BeLeave as well Testimony and documents provided by Mr  Wylie in his filing to the Electoral Commission show that AggregateIQ was founded in 2013 in discussion with executives at Cambridge Analytica s parent company  initially licensed all its software from that company  and for a time received virtually all its income from the company In a statement this week  Jeff Silvester  one of the founders of AggregateIQ  said it was a  digital advertising  web and software development company  and  has never managed  nor did we ever have access to  any Facebook data or database allegedly obtained improperly by Cambridge Analytica  Mr  Silvester did not address the company s work for Vote Leave and BeLeave  A spokesman for Cambridge Analytica did not respond to a request for comment An initial investigation by the Electoral Commission found nothing improper in the relationship between the two organizations  but a court appeal last fall prompted the commission to reopen its inquiry  Mr  Sanni s testimony is additional information recently submitted to that ongoing inquiry He and Mr  Wylie also gave the commission records showing that anyone at Vote Leave continued to have access to the Google Drive used for BeLeave s strategy  planning and internal discussion after the referendum  on June 23  2016 Mr  Sanni graduated from the University of East Anglia at the end of 2015  and began volunteering the next March for the Vote Leave campaign  He worked with a small team of young volunteers in what was then a unit of Vote Leave called BeLeave that tried to craft messages to turn young and liberal people against the European Union by arguing  for example  that it closed doors to the non European world The small BeLeave team initially worked in the same office as Vote Leave and under the oversight of its senior staff  including Mr  Parkinson and Ms  Watson  as did two AggregateIQ employees managing the campaign s online advertising  Mr  Sanni testified to the commission By mid May  however  with the referendum little more than a month away  the Vote Leave campaign was nearing its spending cap At about the same time  the leaders of the Vote Leave campaign instructed their lawyers to draw up a charter for BeLeave to become an independent group  Mr  Sanni was named its secretary and research director while another friend  Darren Grimes  was named its principal and campaign director Mr  Sanni told the commission he was surprised to learn that the leaders of Vote Leave had also decided to direct  900 000 to BeLeave  given that it was overseen by two unpaid  inexperienced people  He and Mr  Grimes were then both 22  But then his friend Mr  Grimes explained that virtually all of that money would be paid directly to AggregateIQ for online advertising In practice  Mr  Sanni said  nothing changed  The BeLeave staff continued to work inside the Vote Leave office  The senior officials of Vote Leave continued to approve their messages  And the same AggregateIQ workers continued to place BeLeave s online advertisements while providing the same service to Vote Leave  We never saw ourselves as a separate organization from the get go   Mr  Sanni said in an interview  echoing his testimony   We were just volunteers  The money paid to AggregateIQ for online advertising produced few results for BeLeave   1 164 email sign ups and 1 005 mobile phone numbers for more than  900 000   leading Mr  Sanni to suspect the money may have gone to promote the larger Vote Leave campaign instead He insisted in the interview that the reason he provided testimony to the commission was not about any past feelings for Mr  Parkinson  now at No  10 Instead  he said  it was out of concern for Mr  Grimes  the other young volunteer  By making Mr  Grimes the nominal owner of BeLeave  the leaders of Vote Leave had made him a target of critical news coverage and potential legal claims  Mr  Sanni argued   He is getting thrown to the dogs   Mr  Sanni said   Everything I am doing is to protect Darren   I now feel sick about what happened   Mr  Sanni said in his testimony  The officials of Vote Leave  used two 22 year olds to cheat in the referendum  Mr  Grimes did not respond to messages seeking comment

Perhaps at some point in the past few years you ve told Facebook that you like  say  Kim Kardashian West  When you hit the thumbs up button on her page  you probably did it because you wanted to see the reality TV star s posts in your news feed  Maybe you realized that marketers could target advertisements to you based on your interest in her What you probably missed is that researchers had figured out how to tie your interest in Ms  Kardashian West to certain personality traits  such as how extroverted you are  very   how conscientious  more than most  and how open minded  only somewhat   And when your fondness for Ms  Kardashian West is combined with other interests you ve indicated on Facebook  researchers believe their algorithms can predict the nuances of your political views with better accuracy than your loved ones As The New York Times reported on Saturday  that is what motivated the consulting firm Cambridge Analytica to collect data from more than 50 million Facebook users  without their consent  to build its own behavioral models to target potential voters in various political campaigns  The company has worked for a political action committee started by John R  Bolton  who served in the George W  Bush administration  as well as for President Trump s presidential campaign in 2016   We find your voters and move them to action   the firm boasts on its website Cambridge Analytica now says it has destroyed the user data it collected on Facebook  Raw data reviewed by The Times suggests the information  or copies of it  may still exist  In either case  specific user information was merely a means to an end  a building block in a far more ambitious construction  a behavioral model powerful enough to manipulate people s activity and  potentially  sway elections The firm adapted its approach to personality modeling from studies conducted by researchers at Stanford University and the Psychometrics Center at the University of Cambridge  The studies relied on data collected by a Facebook app called myPersonality  a 100 question quiz developed by the Psychometrics Center that assessed a person s openness  conscientiousness  extroversion  agreeableness and neuroticism  traits commonly referred to in the academic community by the acronym Ocean Many respondents who took the quiz through the myPersonality app authorized it to gain access to their Facebook profile data  and information about their friend network   access that was allowed by the social network at the time  That allowed researchers to cross reference the results of the quiz   numeric Ocean scores   with the users  Facebook  likes   and build a model from the correlations they found between the two  With that model  the researchers could often make precise guesses about subsequent users  personalities using only a list of their likes  no 100 question quiz necessary One of the studies the Psychometrics Center produced  published in 2015 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences  was built on the  likes  and Ocean scores of more than 70 000 respondents who took the myPersonality quiz on Facebook  It found that a person who liked the movie  Fight Club   for example  was far more likely to be open to new experiences than a person who liked  American Idol   according to a review of data provided to The Times by Michal Kosinski  an author of the 2015 study and a professor of organizational behavior at Stanford In that study  the researchers compared the accuracy of their model with personality assessments made by the respondents  friends  The friends were given a 10 question version of the myPersonality quiz and asked to answer based on their knowledge of the respondents  personalities Based on a sample of more than 32 000 participants who were assessed by both the model and one or two friends  the researchers found that the model  using just 10 likes  was more accurate than a work colleague  With 70 likes  it was more accurate than a friend or roommate  with 150  more accurate than a family member  and with 300  more accurate than a spouse The model  the researchers said  was particularly adept at  predicting life outcomes such as substance use  political attitudes and physical health   The real world efficacy of the approach  however  has been called into question When Cambridge Analytica approached the Psychometrics Center about using its models  the center declined  Cambridge Analytica then turned to Aleksandr Kogan  a psychology professor at Cambridge University who was familiar with the center s work  Dr  Kogan developed a Facebook app called  thisisyourdigitallife   a quiz similar to myPersonality  and used it to harvest data from more than 50 million Facebook profiles  Of those  30 million contained enough information to generate personality profiles  Only 270 000 users authorized Dr  Kogan s app to have access to their data  and all were told that their information was being used for academic research Cambridge then pitched its services to potential political and commercial clients  ranging from Mastercard and the New York Yankees to the Joint Chiefs of Staff Facebook has now banned Cambridge Analytica from its platform  as well as its parent company and Dr  Kogan  In Facebook s eyes  Dr  Kogan s infraction was not collecting the data  but giving it to Cambridge Analytica  Although Kogan gained access to this information in a legitimate way and through the proper channels that governed all developers on Facebook at that time  he did not subsequently abide by our rules   Facebook s deputy general counsel said in a statement on Friday By handing over that information to a private company  Facebook said  Dr  Kogan violated its terms of service Facebook in 2015 changed its policies  including altering rules about how third party apps can gain access to information about users  friends  But user data collected through such apps over the years probably remains in the wild  not to mention the models that can continue to be used to target people around the world 
As Facebook grapples with a backlash over its role in spreading disinformation  an internal dispute over how to handle the threat and the public outcry is resulting in the departure of a senior executive The impending exit of that executive   Alex Stamos  Facebook s chief information security officer   reflects heightened leadership tension at the top of the social network  Much of the internal disagreement is rooted in how much Facebook should publicly share about how nation states misused the platform and debate over organizational changes in the run up to the 2018 midterm elections  according to current and former employees briefed on the matter Mr  Stamos  who plans to leave Facebook by August  had advocated more disclosure around Russian interference of the platform and some restructuring to better address the issues  but was met with resistance by colleagues  said the current and former employees  In December  Mr  Stamos s day to day responsibilities were reassigned to others  they said Mr  Stamos said he would leave Facebook but was persuaded to stay through August to oversee the transition of his responsibilities and because executives thought his departure would look bad  the people said  He has been overseeing the transfer of his security team to Facebook s product and infrastructure divisions  His group  which once had 120 people  now has three  the current and former employees said Mr  Stamos would be the first high ranking employee to leave Facebook since controversy over disinformation on its site  Company leaders   including Mark Zuckerberg  Facebook s chief executive  and Sheryl Sandberg  the chief operating officer   have struggled to address a growing set of problems  including Russian interference on the platform  the rise of false news and the disclosure over the weekend that 50 million of its user profiles had been harvested by Cambridge Analytica  a voter profiling company The developments have taken a toll internally  said the seven people briefed on the matter  who asked not to be identified because the proceedings were confidential  Some of the company s executives are weighing their own legacies and reputations as Facebook s image has taken a beating  Several believe the company would have been better off saying little about Russian interference and note that other companies  such as Twitter  which have stayed relatively quiet on the issue  have not had to deal with as much criticism One central tension at Facebook has been that of the legal and policy teams versus the security team  The security team generally pushed for more disclosure about how nation states had misused the site  but the legal and policy teams have prioritized business imperatives  said the people briefed on the matter  The people whose job is to protect the user always are fighting an uphill battle against the people whose job is to make money for the company   said Sandy Parakilas  who worked at Facebook enforcing privacy and other rules until 2012 and now advises a nonprofit organization called the Center for Humane Technology  which is looking at the effect of technology on people Mr  Stamos said in statement on Monday   These are really challenging issues  and I ve had some disagreements with all of my colleagues  including other executives   On Twitter  he said he was  still fully engaged with my work at Facebook  and acknowledged that his role has changed  without addressing his future plans Facebook did not have a comment on the broader issues around Mr  Stamos s departure Mr  Stamos joined Facebook from Yahoo in June 2015  He and other Facebook executives  such as Ms  Sandberg  disagreed early on over how proactive the social network should be in policing its own platform  said the people briefed on the matter  In his statement  Mr  Stamos said his relationship with Ms  Sandberg was  productive  Mr  Stamos first put together a group of engineers to scour Facebook for Russian activity in June 2016  the month the Democratic National Committee announced it had been attacked by Russian hackers  the current and former employees said By November 2016  the team had uncovered evidence that Russian operatives had aggressively pushed DNC leaks and propaganda on Facebook  That same month  Mr  Zuckerberg publicly dismissed the notion that fake news influenced the 2016 election  calling it a  pretty crazy idea  In the ensuing months  Facebook s security team found more Russian disinformation and propaganda on its site  according to the current and former employees  By the spring of 2017  deciding how much Russian interference to disclose publicly became a major source of contention within the company Mr  Stamos pushed to disclose as much as possible  while others including Elliot Schrage  Facebook s vice president of communications and policy  recommended not naming Russia without more ironclad evidence  said the current and former employees A detailed memorandum Mr  Stamos wrote in early 2017 describing Russian interference was scrubbed for mentions of Russia and winnowed into a blog post last April that outlined  in hypothetical terms  how Facebook could be manipulated by a foreign adversary  they said  Russia was only referenced in a vague footnote  That footnote acknowledged that Facebook s findings did not contradict a declassified January 2017 report in which the director of national intelligence concluded Russia had sought to undermine United States election  and Hillary Clinton in particular Mr  Stamos said in his statement that  we decided that the responsible thing to do would be to make clear that our findings were consistent with those released by the U S  intelligence community  which clearly connected the activity in their report to Russian state sponsored actors  But Facebook s decision to omit Russia backfired  Weeks later  a Time magazine article revealed that Russia had created fake accounts and purchased fake ads to spread propaganda on the platform  allegations that Facebook initially denied By last September  after Mr  Stamos s investigation had revealed further Russian interference  Facebook was forced to reverse course  That month  the company disclosed that beginning in June 2015  Russians had paid Facebook  100 000 to run roughly 3 000 divisive ads to show the American electorate In response  lawmakers like Senator Mark Warner of Virginia  the top Democrat on the intelligence committee  said that although Facebook s revelation was a good first step   I m disappointed it s taken 10 months of raising this issue before they ve become much more transparent  And the revelation also prompted more attention into how Russians had manipulated the social network  Last October and November  Facebook was grilled in front of lawmakers on Capitol Hill for Russian meddling on its platform  along with executives from Twitter and YouTube The public reaction caused some at Facebook to recoil at revealing more  said the current and former employees  Since the 2016 election  Facebook has paid unusual attention to the reputations of Mr  Zuckerberg and Ms  Sandberg  conducting polls to track how they are viewed by the public  said Tavis McGinn  who was recruited to the company last April and headed the executive reputation efforts through September 2017 Mr  McGinn  who now heads Honest Data  which has done polling about Facebook s reputation in different countries  said Facebook is  caught in a Catch 22   Facebook cares so much about its image that the executives don t want to come out and tell the whole truth when things go wrong   he said   But if they don t  it damages their image  Mr  McGinn said he left Facebook after becoming disillusioned with the company s conduct By December 2017  Mr  Stamos  who reports to Facebook s general counsel  proposed that he report directly to higher ups  Facebook executives rejected that proposal and instead reassigned Mr  Stamos s team  splitting the security team between its product team  overseen by Guy Rosen  and infrastructure team  overseen by Pedro Canahuati  according to current and former employees Apart from managing a small team of engineers in San Francisco  Mr  Stamos has largely been left as Facebook s security communicator  Last month  he appeared as Facebook s representative at the Munich Security Conference Over the weekend  after news broke that Cambridge Analytica had harvested data on as many as 50 million Facebook users  Facebook s communications team encouraged Mr  Stamos to tweet in defense of the company  but only after it asked to approve Mr  Stamos s tweets  according to two people briefed on the incident After the tweets set off a furious response  Mr  Stamos deleted them Roger B  McNamee  an early investor in Facebook who said he considered himself a mentor to Mr  Zuckerberg  said the company was failing to face the fundamental problems posed by the Russian meddling and other manipulation of content  I told them   Your business is based on trust  and you re losing trust    said Mr  McNamee  a founder of the Center for Humane Technology   They were treating it as a P R  problem  when it s a business problem  I couldn t believe these guys I once knew so well had gotten so far off track  
Each week  Kevin Roose  technology columnist at The New York Times  discusses developments in the tech industry  offering analysis and maybe a joke or two  Want this newsletter in your inbox  Sign up here You know those weeks when crazy things happen at work  your entire schedule goes haywire and the concept of a good night s sleep starts to resemble a hazy and futile dream  like full employment or healthy pizza Well  folks  this was one of those weeks  On Friday night  when Facebook published a blog post saying that it had suspended Cambridge Analytica for misappropriating user data   a post that was intended to pre empt articles by The New York Times and The Observer of London about that very subject  which were published the next day   it became clear that this was a new kind of Facebook privacy scandal  It has already led to congressional inquiries and user revolts  thrusting the company into the kind of chaos it had not seen in its 14 year history On Wednesday  after a five day silence and lots of speculation about his whereabouts  Mark Zuckerberg  Facebook s chief executive  finally re emerged with a Facebook post and an interview with my colleague Sheera Frenkel and me  among others  You can read the transcript of our interview here  and read our article about Facebook s horrible week here We had only about 30 minutes on the phone with Mr  Zuckerberg  but we managed to get him to address several important topics  the Cambridge Analytica mess  Facebook s lax data policies  its plans to clamp down on third party developer access and notify users whose data was misused  election interference  including previously unreported Macedonian attempts to interfere in last year s Alabama special election  and Facebook s broader responsibility as a global power But Mr  Zuckerberg s responses also raised more questions Here  for example  is how he answered a question about Facebook s business model  which is based on selling advertisers and developers the ability to target Facebook users based on their personal data Narrowly  it may be true that being free and ad supported helps Facebook achieve its goals of connecting billions of people to its services  Facebook has developed a number of ways to make itself cheaper and easier to access   including  in some countries  effectively subsidizing use through its Free Basics program  which allows people to use Facebook without its counting toward their data plans But it s not clear this approach has served society well  Especially in countries like Myanmar  where Facebook was recently blamed by United Nations investigators for fueling ethnic violence against the Rohingya  it s possible that having a slightly higher barrier to entry would be a net good  even if it cost Facebook some users in the short term   And it s not even clear that it would  People already pay for their cellphones and data plans all over the world  and might be willing to part with a small fee to keep using their favorite social network  Switching to a subscription model wouldn t fix all of Facebook s problems overnight  There would still be foreign actors trying to interfere in elections  false news and divisive content intending to sway public opinion  and innumerable other issues  But moving away from an ad supported model would make the network harder to exploit   Bot networks are less effective on subscription platforms  for example   And it would lessen the company s incentive to sell out its users  privacy to advertisers Facebook has already shown a willingness to try new models  WhatsApp  for example  makes money by charging businesses for an enterprise product that lets them message their customers  And this week  in an announcement immediately buried by an avalanche of other news about the company  Facebook said it was experimenting with a subscription model that would allow popular creators to charge  5 per month for access to their posts What if all of Facebook cost  5 per month to use  and certain types of divisive and exploitable ad categories and behaviors were removed from the network entirely  Would users revolt en masse  and decide to colonize some other free social media app  Would Facebook collapse without a pipeline of advertising dollars Maybe  But being smaller might not be a bad thing  If we ve learned anything from this year s troubles  it s this  Facebook s platform problems multiply as it gets bigger and more complex  but its ability to deal with those problems stays fairly constant  Zuckerberg might be dedicated to fixing Facebook s problems  but unless he addresses its biggest problem of all   its enormous scale  paired with a business model that requires the company to monetize its users  private data to the greatest extent possible   there s only so much he can do Kevin Roose writes a column called The Shift and is a writer at large for The New York Times Magazine  You can follow him on Twitter here   kevinroose 
When a former engineer revealed a pattern of sexual harassment at Uber last year  Travis Kalanick  then the company s chief executive  said he would immediately open an investigation When users complained about bugs and problems with the Apple Maps app in 2012  Tim Cook  the company s chief executive  released a statement that said  we fell short  And in 2011  when Netflix tried to split off its mail order DVD business into a company called Qwikster  its chief executive  Reed Hastings  wrote a letter to the public   I messed up   he said   I owe everyone an explanation  But in the past week  as Facebook plunged into a crisis over how Cambridge Analytica  a political consulting firm that provided voter targeting services to the Trump campaign  improperly obtained data on 50 million Facebook users  Mark Zuckerberg  the social network s chief executive  said  well  nothing Neither Mr  Zuckerberg nor Sheryl Sandberg  Facebook s chief operating officer  has made any public appearances this week  Mr  Zuckerberg s last public post on Facebook was a March 2 photo of himself and his wife  Priscilla Chan  baking hamantaschen cookies to celebrate the Jewish holiday of Purim  Ms  Sandberg s most recent post was a four day old photo from her child s debate competition  Updated  Mark Zuckerberg Breaks His Silence  Vows Action to Bolster Data Privacy Facebook employees have described a tense atmosphere in which some joked about selling their stock in the company before it took another dip  The company has lost about  50 billion in market value in the last couple of days  Over the past few months  as criticism of the company s role in the 2016 election has escalated  some employees have sought to transfer to other divisions of the company  such as WhatsApp and Instagram  calling their work on Facebook s main product  demoralizing  On Monday  The New York Times reported that Alex Stamos  the company s chief security officer  was slated to leave the company in August after disagreements with other top executives over the handling of Russia s exploitation of Facebook s platform during the 2016 election season  On Tuesday  Brian Acton  a co founder of WhatsApp  which was acquired by Facebook in 2014 for  19 billion  posted a tweet that read   It is time   deletefacebook   Mr  Acton did not return a request for comment Two people familiar with the matter  who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the discussions were confidential  said that Mr  Zuckerberg planned to address the Cambridge Analytica situation and the larger data privacy issues with a public statement on Wednesday  The statement will be aimed at rebuilding trust with users  one of the people said  In the past week  one of the people said  Mr  Zuckerberg has spent significant time hunkered down with a small group of engineers to discuss how to make Facebook s users more secure  with more control of their data Kate Losse  an early Facebook employee and Mr  Zuckerberg s former speechwriter  said that the Cambridge Analytica controversy was different from previous Facebook privacy scandals  in that it was about an issue at the core of the company s business model that will not be easily remedied  the disclosure of Facebook data to outside sources through its third party developer platform  My guess is that what is giving Zuckerberg pause at this point is the question of how to acknowledge and explain this state of affairs while at the same time mitigating the concerns that will come from people finally understanding how this all worked   she said Mr  Zuckerberg is no stranger to speaking out during times of company crisis  In 2006  users rebelled after Facebook introduced the first version of its news feed  which showed users for the first time what their friends were doing on the social network  As groups formed to protest what they felt was an incursion on their privacy  Mr  Zuckerberg posted a peacemaking note on his Facebook page  Calm down  Breathe  We hear you   he wrote 
WASHINGTON   Facebook on Sunday faced a backlash about how it protects user data  as American and British lawmakers demanded that it explain how a political data firm with links to President Trump s 2016 campaign was able to harvest private information from more than 50 million Facebook profiles without the social network s alerting users Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota  a Democratic member of the Senate Judiciary Committee  went so far as to press for Mark Zuckerberg  Facebook s chief executive  to appear before the panel to explain what the social network knew about the misuse of its data  to target political advertising and manipulate voters  The calls for greater scrutiny followed reports on Saturday in The New York Times and The Observer of London that Cambridge Analytica  a political data firm founded by Stephen K  Bannon and Robert Mercer  the wealthy Republican donor  had used the Facebook data to develop methods that it claimed could identify the personalities of individual American voters and influence their behavior  The firm s so called psychographic modeling underpinned its work for the Trump campaign in 2016  though many have questioned the effectiveness of its techniques But Facebook did not inform users whose data had been harvested  The lack of disclosure could violate laws in Britain and in many American states Damian Collins  a Conservative lawmaker in Britain who is leading a parliamentary inquiry into fake news and Russian meddling in the country s referendum to leave the European Union  said this weekend that he  too  would call on Mr  Zuckerberg or another top executive to testify  The social network sent executives who handle policy matters to answer questions at an earlier hearing in February  It is not acceptable that they have previously sent witnesses who seek to avoid answering difficult questions by claiming not to know the answers   Mr  Collins said in a statement   This also creates a false reassurance that Facebook s stated policies are always robust and effectively policed  The fallout from the reports added to questions Facebook was already confronting over the use of its platform by those seeking to spread Russian propaganda and fake news  The social media giant has grappled with the criticism over the issue for much of the past year  and struggled to keep public opinion on its side Over the weekend  Facebook was on the defensive  Top executives took to Twitter to argue that the company s protections had not been breached  and that Facebook was thus not at fault  This was unequivocally not a data breach   tweeted Andrew Bosworth  a Facebook executive   No systems were infiltrated  no passwords or information were stolen or hacked  The data was obtained in 2014  when Cambridge Analytica  through an outside researcher  paid users small sums to take a personality quiz and download an app  which would scrape some private information from their profiles and from those of their friends   activity that Facebook permitted at the time  The approach was based on a technique pioneered at Cambridge University by data scientists who claimed it could reveal more about a person than even their parents or romantic partners knew The researcher hired by Cambridge Analytica  Alexandr Kogan  told Facebook and his app s users that he was collecting information for academic purposes  not for a political data firm owned by a wealthy conservative  Facebook did nothing to verify how the information was being used Mr  Bosworth argued on Twitter that a violation had been committed only by Cambridge Analytica and Mr  Kogan  whose app  did not follow the data agreements  Facebook s chief security officer  Alex Stamos  issued a similar defense in a series of tweets that have since been deleted  The recent Cambridge Analytica stories by the NY Times and The Guardian are important and powerful  but it is incorrect to call this a  breach  under any reasonable definition of the term   Mr  Stamos tweeted The explanation did little  however  to stem the tide of anger as independent researchers pointed out that many others could have similarly misused Facebook data  Facebook s platform must protect us from predatory behavior   wrote a Twitter user named Evan Baily   or we can t and shouldn t trust the platform  Jonathan Albright  research director at the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University  wrote that the lack oversight and transparency into what sort of data Facebook collected on its users meant that the company s platform could continue to be exploited  Unethical people will always do bad things when we make it easy for them and there are few   if any   lasting repercussions   Mr  Albright said Paul Grewal  a vice president and deputy general counsel at Facebook  said in a statement that the company was looking into whether the data in question still existed   That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people s information   he said This month  The Times viewed a set of raw data from the profiles Cambridge Analytica obtained  And a former employee of the data firm described having recently seen hundreds of gigabytes of unencrypted data files on Cambridge servers There were also questions from technology experts and others about Facebook s reaction to the news reports by The Times and The Observer  especially its decision to suspend the account of Christopher Wylie  a data expert who oversaw Cambridge Analytica s data harvesting   but also spoke out about it to the two news organizations On Friday  Facebook threatened to sue The Observer to stop it from publishing  the newspaper s outgoing editor  John Mulholland  said on Twitter Then  late Friday evening  Facebook posted a statement that expressed alarm at the data leak  The company promised to take action and announced that it was suspending the accounts of Cambridge Analytica  Mr  Kogan and Mr  Wylie By then  Facebook had learned that Mr  Wylie  who left Cambridge Analytica in 2014  was a named source for the news reports In a statement on Sunday  Mr  Wylie described himself as  a curious and naïve 23 year old   when he first went to work for Cambridge Analytica  I feel a sense of regret every day when I see where they have helped take our world   he added   I need to make amends  and that s why I m coming forward  His lawyer  Tamsin Allen  said that last week Mr  Wylie offered to help Facebook recover the missing data Now  though  Facebook said on Sunday  Mr  Wylie is refusing to cooperate with the company until the suspension is lifted   a move the social network is not willing to make because of his role in the data harvesting In both Britain and the United States  lawmakers said that in the light of the new reports  they wanted fresh answers from both Facebook and Cambridge Analytica about how the data was obtained and what was done with it Mr  Collins  the British lawmaker  said he planned to call Alexander Nix  the chief executive of Cambridge Analytica  to return to Parliament and answer questions about testimony last month in which he claimed that the company never obtained or used Facebook data  It seems clear that he has deliberately misled the committee and Parliament   Mr  Collins said In the United States  the attorney general of Massachusetts  Maura Healey  announced on Saturday that her office was opening an investigation   Massachusetts residents deserve answers immediately from Facebook and Cambridge Analytica   she said in a Twitter post that linked to the Times article Also on Saturday  the two top Congressional Democrats leading inquiries into Russian interference in the 2016 election   Senator Mark Warner of Virginia and Representative Adam Schiff of California   called for investigations of the Facebook data leak  This raises serious questions about the level of detail that Cambridge Analytica knew about users   said Mr  Schiff  who is the ranking Democrat on the House intelligence committee 
In 2007  a young Mark Zuckerberg stood on a stage in San Francisco and announced that Facebook was throwing open its doors No longer  he said  would Facebook be a closed off software product like every other social network  Instead  it would become an open platform and invite outside developers to build apps and programs on top of it  We want to make Facebook into something of an operating system   Mr  Zuckerberg told a reporter At the time  the announcement drew little notice outside the programming world  Developers quickly went to work making fun and quirky apps that plugged into Facebook   early hits included  Rendezbook   a kind of proto Tinder that allowed users to match with each other for  random flings   and CampusRank  which allowed college students to nominate their peers for yearbook type awards Later  popular games like FarmVille arrived  and apps like Tinder and Spotify began allowing their users to log in using their Facebook credentials  In some ways  it was a fair trade  Facebook got to weave itself more deeply into users  internet habits  and the outside app developers got access to a big audience and valuable data about their users  In all  millions of apps have been created with Facebook s open platform tools Through it all  Facebook s users were mostly unfazed  Sure  these apps collected data about their lives  But they seemed convenient and harmless  and  really  what could go wrong Today  more than a decade later  the consequences of Facebook s laissez faire approach are becoming clear  Over the weekend  The New York Times reported that Cambridge Analytica  a British consulting firm  improperly acquired the private data of about roughly 50 million Facebook users  and used it to target voters on behalf of the Trump campaign during the 2016 presidential election What happened with Cambridge Analytica wasn t technically a data breach  since this trove of personal information wasn t stolen from Facebook s servers  Rather  it was given away freely to the maker of a Facebook personality quiz app called  thisisyourdigitallife  That app  which was developed by a University of Cambridge professor  collected data about the 270 000 people who installed it  along with data about their Facebook friends  totaling 50 million people in all  The professor  Aleksandr Kogan  then gave the data he had harvested to Cambridge Analytica Technically  only this last step violated Facebook s rules  which prohibit selling or giving away data collected by a third party app  The rest was business as usual  Third party apps collect vast amounts of detailed personal information about Facebook users every day  including their ages  location  pages they ve liked and groups they belong to  Users can opt out of sharing specific pieces of information  but it s unclear how many do This kind of broad data collection is not only allowed but encouraged by Facebook  which wants to keep developers happily building on top of its platform  Permissiveness is a feature  as they say  not a bug But in the wake of incidents like the data leak to Cambridge Analytica  some are questioning the costs of such loose policies on an influential platform with 2 2 billion registered users  It seems insane that you can make haphazard decisions about so many people s data   said Can Duruk  a technology consultant and software engineer  Facebook  he said  was  extremely lax with what kind of data they allowed people to get  In a Facebook post on Monday  Andrew Bosworth  a Facebook vice president  admitted that that thinking may have been a mistake  We thought that every app could be social   Mr  Bosworth wrote   Your calendar should have your events and your friends birthdays  your maps should know where your friends live  your address book should show their pictures  It was a reasonable vision but it didn t materialize the way we had hoped  An early clue about the potential for misuse of Facebook s third party developer tools came in 2010 when my colleague Emily Steel  then at The Wall Street Journal  reported that an online tracking company  RapLeaf  was collecting and reselling data it had gathered from third party Facebook apps to marketing firms and political consultants  In response  Facebook cut off RapLeaf s data access and said it would  dramatically limit  the misuse of its users  personal information by outside parties But preventing data hungry developers from exploiting Facebook s treasure trove of personal information remained challenging  In 2015  Facebook removed the ability of third party developers to collect detailed information about the friends of users who had installed an app  citing privacy concerns   Cambridge Analytica s data trove  which included this type of information  was gathered in 2014  before the change   Facebook has also taken away tools used by developers to create games and quizzes that barraged users with annoying notifications But the core functions of Facebook s open platform tool are still intact  There are still many third party apps like  thisisyourdigitallife  out there  vacuuming up intimate data about Facebook users  That data doesn t disappear  and Facebook has no real recourse to stop it from falling into the wrong hands Not all open data access is used irresponsibly  Researchers and nongovernmental organizations have used Facebook s third party development tools to respond to natural disasters  And many of the functions that internet users depend on   for example  the ability to import their digital address books into a new messaging app   are possible thanks only to the tools that allow for third party development known as application programming interfaces  or A P I s  Everything we depend on uses A P I s   said Kin Lane  a software engineer who maintains a website called API Evangelist   They re in your home  in your business  in your car  It s how these platforms innovate and do cool  interesting things  In Facebook s case  permissive data policies were also good for business  Third party developers built millions of apps on top of Facebook s platform  giving Facebook users more reasons to spend time on the site and generating more ad revenue for the company  Restricting access to data would limit Facebook s usefulness to developers and could drive them to build on a rival platform instead  making those products better In this context  it s even less surprising that Dr  Kogan and Cambridge Analytica were able to use a silly personality quiz to collect information about millions of Americans  After all  why else would the quiz be there

Good Thursday Here s what we re watching   Tariffs will test investors  resolve   Trump on Tariffs   If they charge us  we charge them    The stock market is proving Gary D  Cohn right   China tech stocks are also tumbling  Dropbox has priced its I P O Get this in your inbox each morning  Sign up here An unorthodox action by President Trump unsettles investors  but after a freakout  their optimism returns and the stock market moves higher But will investors shrug off President Trump s tariffs on China The stock market plunged Thursday after Mr  Trump announced the measures against China  Since mid February  when the Trump administration laid out its case for steel and aluminum tariffs  the S  P  500 is down 3 2 percent  The Dow Jones industrial average is off nearly 5 percent Until now  investors might have thought they could take Mr  Trump s trade pronouncements in stride  After all  many countries have won a reprieve from the steel and aluminum tariffs  And as Edward Alden of the Council on Foreign Relations wrote Thursday of the anti China measures   The administration is delaying the action to solicit comments from affected U S  companies  and it is quite possible the final tariffs will fall short of the threats  Just as the Trump administration has stepped back from quickly imposing the steel and aluminum tariffs  it may soften its stance if China suggests that its open to negotiations  The world could relax But China may not budge  As our colleague Steven Lee Myers reports  President Xi Jinping has so far managed to navigate Mr  Trump s rhetoric while maintaining a strong nationalist image at home  Yet Mr  Trump s tariff announcement  along with moves perceived by the Chinese as humiliating  may prompt China to retaliate with force Investors would then scramble to quantify the economic repercussions  They might not be terrible Some American companies  like computer chip makers  get substantial revenue from China  But on average  companies in the S  P  500 index derive a small share of their sales from the country And some investors may take a long view  believing that U S  companies have long been treated unfairly in China  A trade fight that eventually relaxes some of those disadvantageous conditions could bolster the long term prospects of those firms  And if the U S  is able to recruit other countries to its cause  China may relent Still  much could go wrong  A true test of investor sentiment will come if China fights back  Markets could fall further  creating a financial chain reaction that dampens the wider economy  A lot would depend on how Mr  Trump responds to Chinese actions  Would he up the ante  It s genuinely hard to predict how this will turn out   said Scott Kennedy  an expert in Chinese trade at the Center for Strategic and International Studies   whether one side will back down or whether it will spiral into a trade war    Peter EavisHere are the details   The data storage and collaboration company sold 36 million shares at  21 apiece  its expected range of  18 to  20 a share   At that price  the offering raised  756 million   At  21 a share  the company has a market value of gave Dropbox a market value of  9 2 billion The contextThe demand for Dropbox s shares suggests investors overcame any concern about daunting competition from the likes of Microsoft  Google and Amazon  all of which provide cloud storage services  A successful debut could pave the way for other unicorns to soon go public President Trump said he would impose about  60 billion worth of annual tariffs on Chinese imports as the White House moved to punish China for what it says is a pattern of co opting American technology and trade secrets and robbing companies of jobs and billions of dollars in revenue The tariffs will target 1 300 lines of Chinese goods   everything from shoes and clothing to electronics   the NYT reports administration officials said Mr  Trump  the officials added  will also direct the Treasury Department to impose restrictions on Chinese investment in American technology companies  a practice that they said the Chinese government uses to develop its own  national champions  in cutting edge industries like A I  and autonomous vehicles  The end objective of this is to get China to modify its unfair trade practices   Everett Eissenstat  the deputy director of the National Economic Council  told reporters Peter Navarro  the director of the White House National Trade Council and an architect of the measures  cast the tariffs as part of a seminal shift in how the U S  views China  Rather than trying to draw it into the rules based international economic order   a policy that dates back to Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger   the U S  now regards China as a strategic competitor  bent on eroding American security and prosperity   Mark Landler and Jim TankersleyBefore he said he was leaving his White House position earlier this month  Mr  Cohn reportedly warned that protectionist trade policies could jeopardize the stock rally that has taken place since Donald Trump became president  After Mr  Trump announced tariffs on steel and aluminum  the stock market slid  but soon recovered those losses  reassuring the president that his decision to introduce tariffs was right On Thursday  the Trump administration announced trade restrictions against China  The news appeared to weigh on markets  So  how have stocks done since important dates in the trade skirmish One important milestone was the Commerce Department s announcement last month that suggested the Trump administration was serious about introducing steel and aluminum tariffs  The S  P  500 index is down 2 3 percent since the day before that announcement  Mr  Trump actually announced plans for those tariffs on March 1  The S  P  500 is down 1 7 percent since Feb  28 The Dow Jones industrial average has done a lot worse  however  It is down 3 7 percent since the Commerce Department s announcement  and 3 1 percent since Mr  Trump announced his intentions  The decline encapsulated how trade tension might hurt specific businesses  in particular  Boeing s   Peter EavisMuch of the Dow s underperformance can be traced to the aircraft maker s stock The Trump administration s trade policies have hit Boeing  the most heavily weighted stock in the Dow  particularly hard Aluminum makes up about 80 percent of the weight of most commercial aircrafts  according to Brooke Sutherland and David Fickling of Gadfly  That means tariffs on imported aluminum would likely raise Boeing s costs more than its competitors  Boeing also views China  the main target of the Trump administration s protectionist trade policies  as an important growth market  The country is set to overtake the U S  as the biggest aviation market by 2022  Ms  Sutherland and Mr  Fickling write China could target Boeing if the country decides to retaliate against the U S Boeing is down 3 6 percent today  shaving more than 80 points off the blue chip index  Since the Commerce Department released its report calling for tariffs on imported steel and aluminum  the stock is down 8 7 percent  worth more than 200 points off the Dow Boeing drove the Dow higher for much of Mr  Trump s presidency  more than doubling during his first 12 months in office Boeing s climb has had an outsized impact on the Dow  The index is price weighted  meaning that the higher priced stocks have a bigger pull on the index MoneyBeat s Ben Eisen noted that at the end of January  the stock accounted for 9 4 percent of Dow  up from 6 percent a year earlier  By comparison  Boeing makes up just 0 8 percent of the market capitalization weighted S  P  500 Chinese tech stocks are also tumbling Shares of Alibaba are off 4 2 percent  Tencent 5 percent and Baidu 4 3 percent in the wake of the Trump administration s plan to impose about  60 billion worth of annual tariffs on Chinese imports That is much worse than their American counterparts  Amazon  Facebook and Google s parent Alphabet are down between 1 2 percent and 2 2 percent by comparison Shares of Baidu  Alibaba and Tencent   collectively known as BAT   have soared over the past year  pushing their combined market value above  1 trillion As these companies have grown  so have their ambitions  All three have moved to expand beyond their core business and home market and have aggressively invested in Americantech start ups to help them do so China s largest internet companies   the BAT plus the e commerce company JD com   have invested  5 6 billion in 48 tech deals in the United States over the past two years  according to CBI Insights data via CNBC Such investments have raised concerns in the United States  The Trump administration officials said the Chinese government uses these investments to develop its own  national champions  in cutting edge industries like A I  and autonomous vehicles  As part of the China tariffs  the Trump administration plans to place restrictions on Chinese investment in American technology companies Shrugging off hikes by the Federal Reserve and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority this week  the Bank of England maintained its key interest rate at 0 5 percent today Two members of the central bank s monetary policy committee called for an immediate rate increase  but the majority of the committee did not see the need for a hike at this time  Most economists expect the Bank of England to raise rates in May  when it releases its latest quarterly projection for inflation In the minutes from the committee s latest meeting  the central bank said that there had been  few surprises  in recent economic data and its February projections for inflation appeared  broadly on track   The bank said that the May inflation report would allow the committee to  undertake a fuller assessment of the underlying momentum in the economy  the degree of slack remaining and the extent of domestic inflationary pressures    Chad BrayAfter days of questions and criticism about his silence  the Facebook co founder and C E O  posted a statement and gave a series of interviews   Sheryl Sandberg offered a statement  too  What he promised  to investigate apps that had access to large amounts of Facebook data  to restrict developers  data access and to show users how to revoke app permissions Highlights from his interviews   To CNN   I m not sure we shouldn t be regulated   Zuckerberg said   There are things like ad transparency regulation that I would love to see    He also made ad transparency promises to Wired    To the NYT  about Facebook s business model   I don t think the ad model is going to go away  because I think fundamentally  it s important to have a service like this that everyone in the world can use  and the only way to do that is to have it be very cheap or free    On why it took so long for him to respond  compared with other tech C E O s   I know that there was a lot of pressure to speak sooner  but my assessment was that it was more important that what we said was fully accurate    On  DeleteFacebook   I don t think we ve seen a meaningful number of people act on that  but  you know  it s not good  Peter Eavis s take  Missing from his response was a full explanation of why Facebook took so long to disclose

When the Russia question came up during a hearing at the British Parliament last month  Alexander Nix did not hesitate  We ve never worked in Russia   said Mr  Nix  head of a data consulting firm that advised the Trump campaign on targeting voters  As far as I m aware  we ve never worked for a Russian company   Mr  Nix added   We ve never worked with a Russian organization in Russia or any other country  and we don t have any relationship with Russia or Russian individuals  But Mr  Nix s business did have some dealings with Russian interests  according to company documents and interviews Mr  Nix is a director of SCL Group  a British political and defense contractor  and chief executive of its American offshoot  Cambridge Analytica  which advised the Trump campaign  The firms  employees  who often overlap  had contact in 2014 and 2015 with executives from Lukoil  the Russian oil giant Lukoil was interested in how data was used to target American voters  according to two former company insiders who said there were at least three meetings with Lukoil executives in London and Turkey  SCL and Lukoil denied that the talks were political in nature  and SCL also said there were no meetings in London The contacts took place as Cambridge Analytica was building a roster of Republican clients in the United States   and harvesting the Facebook profiles of over 50 million users to develop tools to analyze voters  behavior Cambridge Analytica also included extensive questions about Russia s president  Vladimir V  Putin  in surveys it was carrying out in American focus groups in 2014  It is not clear what   or which client   prompted the line of questioning  which asked for views on topics ranging from Mr  Putin s popularity to Russian expansionism On two promotional documents obtained by The New York Times  SCL said it did business in Russia  In both documents  the country is highlighted on world maps that specify the location of SCL clients  with one of the maps noting that the clients were for the firm s elections division  In a statement  SCL said an employee had done  commercial work  about 25 years ago  for a private company in Russia  Cambridge Analytica has been a political flash point since its role in the Trump campaign attracted scrutiny after the election  While Mr  Nix s firm turned over some records to the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence during its investigation of Russian interference  Democrats on the committee want a fuller review   It is imperative to interview a broader range of individuals employed by or linked to Cambridge Analytica   they said in a report this month Asked about the Russian oil company  a spokesman for SCL said that in 2014 the firm s commercial division  discussed helping Lukoil Turkey better engage with its loyalty card customers at gas stations   The spokesman said SCL was not ultimately hired Arash Repac  chief executive of Lukoil Eurasia Petrol  offered a different explanation for the talks  He said that a meeting he attended with SCL in Turkey involved a promotional campaign with local soccer teams  We needed somebody to guide us with the customer data that we were collecting   he wrote in response to a question from The Times   Even though our campaign went ahead  we decided not to cooperate with SCL  No contracts were signed  But Christopher Wylie  who helped found Cambridge Analytica and develop the company s voter profiling technology  said Lukoil showed interest in how the company used data to tailor messaging to American voters  I remember being super confused   said Mr  Wylie  who took part in one of the Lukoil meetings  I kept asking Alexander   Can you explain to me what they want    he said  referring to Mr  Nix   I don t understand why Lukoil wants to know about political targeting in America   We re sending them stuff about political targeting   they then come and ask more about political targeting   Mr  Wylie said  adding that Lukoil  just didn t seem to be interested  in how the techniques could be used commercially Mr  Wylie  a former contractor  left SCL before the talks concluded and could not say what became of the relationship with the oil company  He had a falling out with SCL and tried to set up a rival business  SCL said he had violated a nondisclosure agreement and that his comments were an attempt to hurt the company A second person familiar with the discussions backed up Mr  Wylie s account  but spoke on the condition of anonymity because of a confidentiality agreement Though Lukoil is not state owned  it depends on Kremlin support  and its chief executive  Vagit Alekperov  has met with Mr  Putin on a number of occasions  Reuters reported last year that Lukoil and other companies received instructions from the state energy ministry on providing news stories favorable to Russian leadership 
 Good Monday  Here s what we re watching   Facebook s stock slides as lawmakers want answers on the latest controversy   Mark Zuckerberg is on the hot seat following the Cambridge Analytica revelations   Congress is racing to complete its spending bill   U S  companies warn President Trump about sweeping tariffs Get this in your inbox every morning  Sign up here Larry Ellison is the founder of Oracle and the 10th richest man on the planet  according to Forbes  Dr  David Agus is a best selling author and physician whose clients included Steve Jobs and Sumner Redstone Of all the companies the two could have started together  they ve chosen an unusual approach  a hydroponic farming start up focused on creating more healthful food Their new business  Sensei  formally unveiled itself Monday afternoon  wading into an industry that has become increasingly popular among investors Silicon Valley Start up Plenty raised  200 million from SoftBank s  100 billion Vision Fund  Bowery Farming  whose vegetables are now sold in a few grocery stores in New York City  has collected money from the likes of Google s venture arm and General Catalyst Sensei is focused more on wellness  While the company ultimately plans to expand into an array of businesses  its initial focus is on hydroponic farming  using software and sensors to monitor growing conditions   Its first farm is on Lanai  the Hawaiian island of which Mr  Ellison owns roughly 98 percent  Sensei s first batch of crops includes Black Trifele tomatoes and Komatsuna mustard greens  with its yardstick for production being nutrition per acre  So far  the conversation in agriculture has been dominated by productivity  How much food can we grow in a square foot  But scale is just part of the equation   Dr  Agus said in a statement   To properly nourish the world  we need to consider how nutritious that food is  This is where Sensei is focused  Its first customer is Hawaii  which imports the majority of its food  Sensei said that it can provide the state fresh food within 24 hours of harvesting  compared with over a week for imported vegetables But the company is also eager to tout its tech bona fides  Its farm runs off solar power provided by Tesla panels  And it claims to use just 10 percent of the water used in traditional farming methods  For so long  agriculture has been one of the least digitized industries   Daniel Gruneberg  Sensei s president  said in a statement   Now  we can combine software  sensors and robotics to make giant leaps in sustainable farming and perhaps  more importantly  the quality of our food    Michael de la MercedFacebook s stock had its worst day in about four years Shares of the social media giant finished down about 7 percent after the NYT reported that a political data firm with ties to 2016 Trump campaign harvested private information from over 50 million user profiles The news reports raised the specter of greater government scrutiny and potential regulatory action toward the technology sector  Already  government officials in the United States  Europe and elsewhere have been demanding tougher oversight of the world s largest tech companies  That  in turn  could erode the industry s profits and potentially force some companies to adjust their business models Facebook s stock is now down more than 12 percent from its all time high hit at the start of February  We think this episode is another indication of systemic problems at Facebook   said Brian Wieser  an analyst at New York based brokerage Pivotal Research Group Facebook s woes showed signs of spreading  too The S  P  500 tech sector is the worst performing of the index s 11 sectors Shares of Google parent Alphabet closed down about 3 2 percent  Amazon fell around 1 7 percent and Apple finished off 1 5 percent In all  Monday s slide wiped more than  80 billion off the market value of Facebook  Amazon  Netflix and Alphabet  Facebook accounted for more than  35 billion of that total  In fact  the company is no longer among the five biggest companies in the S  P  500 by market capitalization Fund flows added fuel to the selloff  MoneyBeat s Akane Otani reports that mutual funds and exchange traded funds tracking U S  technology stocks posted a record  2 6 billion in net inflows last week  according to data from fund tracker EPFR Global  That put year to date inflows at  47 5 billion Given the outsized role the tech sector has played in the aging bull market  its declines Monday dragged down the broader stock indexes The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 336 points  or 1 35 percent  while the S  P  500  was off nearly 39 points  or 1 42 percent Is Mark Zuckerberg s unusually powerful position at Facebook in part to blame for the latest backlash against the company The giant social media company is under the spotlight because a political data firm apparently misused information about more than 50 million Facebook users  Facebook is still facing questions about Russia linked accounts that had significant reach within the United States through the social network  In both cases  Facebook has struggled to show the public that it can get in front of its problems  Information about the Russia linked accounts came out piecemeal  and Facebook knew as early as 2015 that the political data firm had violated its data policies Mr  Zuckerberg at first downplayed concerns about Facebook s role in the 2016 presidential election  something he later said he regretted   His recent communications contain more high minded deliberation than hard discussion of the company s problems and how to deal with them These look like the reactions of a leader who thinks he is not going anywhere  Indeed  through his holding of special voting shares  Mr  Zuckerberg has an especially powerful position at Facebook that might shield him from the normal forces of accountability  C E O s without that protection might do more to tackle a big problem because it more directly threatens their job security Facebook  of course  has taken steps to address the abuse of its network  It has added hundreds of new employees to help police posts  and it has implemented artificial intelligence technology to spot material that falls afoul of the company s guidelines  Such initiatives cost money  Mr  Zuckerberg earlier this year said that such initiatives would have a significant impact on Facebook s profitability  Indeed  there s a strong argument to make that Mr  Zuckerberg s protected position will allow the company to press ahead with expensive investments in the face of any shareholder grumbling that may arise In the near term  though  it s hard to envision shareholders applying significant pressure on Facebook to be more responsive to the political and legal risks  They may believe Facebook s extraordinary profitability   its operating profits are roughly equivalent to 40 percent of its revenue   will help the stock ride what they see as a passing storm If governments propose restrictions on using members  data  Facebook s business model would be tested  The company s board  in theory  should press Mr  Zuckerberg for details on how he will deal with such shackles  But prominent board members like Marc L  Andreessen and Peter A  Thiel are skeptical of regulation  Facebook might be tempted to fight back Lawmakers may hold the line  however  sensing that the public has real concerns about the company  And if Facebook s responses look tardy and inadequate  the consequences could be harsh  as the fate of Wells Fargo  shows  Mr  Zuckerberg  in his uniquely dominant position  is the one person who can make sure this doesn t happen   Peter EavisLawmakers in the U S  and Britain want Mark Zuckerberg to explain how Cambridge Analytica  the political data firm founded by Steve Bannon and Robert Mercer  harvested private information from over 50 million user profiles  It s clear these platforms can t police themselves   tweeted Senator Amy Klobuchar  a Democratic member of the Senate Judiciary Committee What happened  The NYT and The Observer of London reported how Cambridge had collected data from an outside researcher to better target Facebook users  Christopher Wylie  who oversaw Cambridge s data collection until 2014  told the NYT of his former company   For them  this is a war  and it s all fair  Facebook argued that the incident wasn t a data breach and that Cambridge had committed a violation  But former Federal Trade Commission officials told the WaPo that Facebook may have violated a privacy pact reached with the regulator   The tech giant is reviewing whether one of its employees had been aware of the data leak  More on Cambridge Analytica  Alexander Nix  the company s chief  is facing scrutiny over business dealings with Russian interests  Mr  Wylie said that one Russian company  the oil giant Lukoil  appeared more interested in political message targeting than commercial uses  And Cambridge is reportedly trying to block the airing of a report by Channel 4  a British television channel  in which reporters went undercover at the firm Critic s cornerJeffrey Goldfarb of Breakingviews writes A woman in Tempe  Ariz   has died after being hit by a self driving car operated by Uber  in what appears to be the first known death of a pedestrian struck by an autonomous vehicle on a public road The Uber vehicle was in autonomous mode with a human safety driver at the wheel when it struck the woman  who was crossing the street outside of a crosswalk  the Tempe police said in a statement  The episode happened on Sunday around 10 p m  The woman was not publicly identified Uber said it had suspended testing of its self driving cars in Tempe  Pittsburgh  San Francisco and Toronto  Our hearts go out to the victim s family  We are fully cooperating with local authorities in their investigation of this incident   an Uber spokeswoman  Sarah Abboud  said in a statement The fatal crash will most likely raise questions about regulations for self driving cars  Testing of self driving cars is already underway for vehicles that have a human driver ready to take over if something goes wrong  but states are starting to allow companies to test cars without a person in the driver s seat  This month  California said that  in April  it would start allowing companies to test autonomous vehicles without anyone behind the wheel   Daisuke WakabayashiThe newspaper publisher announced Monday that Michael W  Ferro Jr   a Chicago entrepreneur and its biggest shareholder  has stepped down as the company s chairman  The move came just weeks after Mr  Ferro helped negotiate the sale of Tronc s crown jewel  The Los Angeles Times Justin Dearborn  the company s chief executive  will replace Mr  Ferro as chairman  I am confident that under the leadership of Justin and the rest of the board and management team Tronc will continue to deliver value for investors while executing the plan for digital transformation   Mr  Ferro said in a statement Mr  Ferro will remain an investor in Tronc  But his decision to step down as chairman follows a period of intense public scrutiny   Sydney EmberThe Long Term Stock Exchange hoping to popularize long term thinking as a corporate governance strategy has taken another step toward making its goal a reality The start up disclosed today that its partner  the IEX stock exchange  has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to let it apply its listing rules to the IEX The filing   which will commence the public part of the S E C  s review of the rule changes at IEX   advances the LTSE s aim of enshrining what it believes are best practices in running companies into corporate charters If the S E C approves the rules  it means that companies can go public using the LTSE principles  but also have their stocks trade on traditional exchanges like the N Y S E  and the Nasdaq like any other listing  That means these companies can get the liquidity they need along with the corporate governance structure that they want  according to the LTSE s founder  Eric Ries It also formalizes a tie up between LTSE and IEX  the exchange best known as the subject of Michael Lewis s  Flash Boys  What the principles include  Letting so called  citizens   or investors who plan on sticking with companies for the long term  eventually accumulate more voting power over the years than  tourists  who plan on sticking around for a shorter time   Blocking the use of certain kinds of compensation  including short term bonuses paid to executives based on metrics like reaching a certain milestone for quarterly earnings   Banning short term guidance   Having long term investors register their holdings with the company   The company will know effectively in real time who their long term investors are   Mr  Ries said   Reporting requirements that include disclosing earnings per share net of buybacks  to provide a more accurate way of measuring how a company is doing without factoring in financial engineering The context  Mr  Ries has spoken of the need to reward long term investors   Most of the listing standards are designed to align managers and long term shareholders   he told me   That frees up management to do what s right    It comes as companies continue to bemoan short term thinking in the stock markets that has C E O s focused more on meeting a quarter s targets than longer term goals   LTSE s goal is to eventually become a stock exchange on which companies list their shares  But for now  it wants to be allowed to create a special kind of listing for IEX that lets companies go public under its principles   LTSE also plans to promote itself as serving companies first and foremost and to make money more from listing fees and tools and services for its companies  rather than from trading offerings and data aimed at investors The caveatIt s a long road ahead  Not just for the rule change process  but also in convincing start ups to adopt these rules when they go public  What we have promised our venture investors is not that this is going to instantly transform the market overnight   Mr  Ries said   Michael de la MercedFriday is the deadline for lawmakers to pass a budget  and they are considering a plan that would cost more than  1

Good Monday  Here s what we re watching   Best day for stocks in nearly three years   A reality check on the White House s tariff tactics   Tim Cook and other C E O s took shots at Facebook   Eddie Lampert finally speaks about Sears   Washington and Beijing hold trade talks Get this in your inbox each morning  Sign up here Stocks on Wall Street surged on signs of easing trade tensions The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 669 points  or 2 8 percent  the S  P  500 surged 2 7 percent and the tech heavy Nasdaq Composite climbed 3 3 percent It was the largest one day point gain for the Dow since October 2008  according to The WSJ  and the biggest one day percentage gain for S  P  500 and Dow since August 2015 Worries that the Trump administration s protectionist policies could ignite a trade war between the world s two largest economies punished equities last week  American stocks endured their worst week in two years as the Dow lost 1 400 points  or 5 7 percent Tensions seemed to relax over the weekend  The WSJ reported late Sunday that  China and the U S  have quietly started negotiating to improve U S  access to Chinese markets   Also  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in an interview that he s  cautiously hopeful  that China will reach a deal to avoid tariffs Shares jumped at the open and the momentum gained through the day as last week s hardest hit sectors led the way   The S  P  500 technology sector rose 4 percent  Microsoft and Apple gained 7 6 percent and 4 8 percent  respectively   The KBW Bank Index climbed 3 percent on Monday  after tumbling 8 percent last week  Bank of America finished up 4 4 percent  while Morgan Stanley gained 4 3 percent  The two stocks had fallen nearly 5 percent on Friday   Even Facebook  which was down 6 5 percent earlier in the day from the continued fallout from the Cambridge Analytica scandal  was able to eek out gains  The stock finished up 0 4 percent higher   Gun stocks were the exception  Shares of publicly traded firearms companies fell in the wake Remington Outdoor bankruptcy filing and this weekend rallies for gun control  American Outdoor Brands fell 2 3 percent  Vista Outdoor dropped 3 8 percent and Sturm  Ruger   Co  slipped less than 1 percent Investors last week looked at President Trump s tariffs against Chinese products and seemed to conclude that he was taking the U S  into a trade war with China  The stock market plunged 6 percent Perhaps eager to stop the rout  the White House on Monday had a less confrontational message  Mr  Trump is applying one of his negotiating tactics  According to this view  the tariff proposal was a jarring move partly aimed at getting China to see that the U S  was serious about wanting to make trade with China fairer From a CNBC interview with Kevin Hassett  the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers Mr  Hassett s comments were in response to a WSJ article reporting that China and the U S  were quietly engaged in trade negotiations Investors seemed somewhat relieved  The stock market was up 1 5 percent on Monday  Of course  if the stakes are small enough  a deal may get done in the coming months that allows both sides to claim victory  But it seems unlikely that China would quickly agree to a far reaching overhaul of the rules that govern foreign investment in the country  a major area of dispute  Our colleagues Raymond Zhong and Paul Mozur showed the depth of the divide there Mr  Trump could up the ante if China shows no real signs that it will open up considerably  That could roil the markets again  The White House may want to signal that it can take market turmoil in stride  Mr  Hassett on Monday seemed to say that the White House expects market sell offs as it pursues its trade agenda  Rising risk premiums means investors require a better return on their stocks and bonds to cover higher risks  This usually involves a decline in price to make their returns look better to prospective buyers  Still  the more conciliatory tone from the White House after the sell off suggests there is not a strong desire for a full on trade war   Peter EavisThe stock is down 6 5 percent Monday

Development Forum in Beijing that the government should tighten privacy regulations  after last week s revelations about Facebook and Cambridge Analytica Apple often uses privacy as a selling point  but Mr  Cook wasn t the only critic  Elon Musk deleted SpaceX and Tesla s Facebook pages  saying that the Tesla one  looks lame anyway   Sir Martin Sorrell of the ad giant WPP said Facebook needed to  step up to the mark  and be responsible for content on its platform  And some companies have stopped buying ads on Facebook  highlighting how advertisers want more transparency about performance   Users also complained that the Android app tracked calls and text messages  Meanwhile  Facebook took out full page ads in several British and American newspapers   including the NYT   for an apology signed by Mark Zuckerberg Elsewhere in Cambridge Analytica news  A volunteer for the campaign for Britain to leave the E U  said that a Canadian data company linked to Cambridge Analytica had played a role in the organization s work  Groups campaigning against Brexit have written to Prime Minister Theresa May demanding an investigation into what members of her cabinet and her staff knew Andrew s takeMr  Cook s points on privacy are absolutely right  But he has a tough needle to thread  given that Apple does business in China and acknowledges that it is  subject to each country s laws  that it does business in  Apple encrypts all user data and says there is no back door   and I believe that   most security and political experts have speculated that Beijing might ultimately be able to gain access iCloud data for Chinese customers  It adopted a law requiring all cloud services to be operated by Chinese companies  Apple says that it lobbied against the new law  but ultimately complied As for Facebook s ad  take note of this   We expect there are others  And when we find them  we will ban them and tell everyone affected   Settle in for more episodes before this soap opera ends

As Silicon Valley experiences a wave of criticism  even some former colleagues are becoming adversaries Another prominent skeptic spoke out this week  as a creator of one of Facebook s top products waded into criticism of the internet giant  It is time   deletefacebook   wrote Brian Acton  one of the founders of WhatsApp  wrote on Twitter  His company was bought by Facebook for  19 billion in 2014  The deal made him a billionaire Mr  Acton s anti Facebook message  retweeted more than 10 000 times  captured a moment in the tech industry when even some of its best known people are publicly calling for change  The chorus has grown louder this week  as Facebook faces questions over how it allowed a political consulting firm  Cambridge Analytica  to obtain data on 50 million users  The question is   What are you loyal to    said Tristan Harris  a former Google employee who has started The Center for Humane Technology  an organization for Silicon Valley workers who want to change corporate culture  He has been critical of social media companies for creating addictive products that inflame cultural tensions  Are you more loyal to your company   Mr  Harris said   Or are you more loyal to protecting the fabric of our society  The tech defections have accelerated in recent months  especially for Facebook Justin Rosenstein  the creator of the Facebook  like  button  deleted the product from his phone and spoke out about the industry using psychologically manipulative advertising  Chamath Palihapitiya  Facebook s former head of user growth  said in December that the company was  ripping apart the social fabric of how society works   And Sandy Parakilas  a former Facebook platform operations manager  wrote on Tuesday in The Washington Post that Mark Zuckerberg  Facebook s chief executive  must  be held accountable for the negligence of his company  Loyalty to a company is beginning to crack because many tech workers are being asked to build or defend products they question  Mr  Harris said  His center is making resources for engineers on how to build more ethical products and starting an educational campaign  called  The Truth About Tech   in 55 000 American schools  More people are speaking up because they feel like they ve been told lies   Mr  Harris said   You can t just repeat   We re making the world more open  over and over and over again while democracy is burning  Silicon Valley companies have long prized secrecy and loyalty among their workers  who often exercise  play sports and eat three meals a day together  Facebook especially is known for its tight knit community  Each employee has an annual  Faceversary  on his or her hire date  a ritual that within the company is seen as deeply meaningful and is usually accompanied by balloons  Until very recently  it was taken as a given that tech equaled progress and tech equaled good and tech equaled economic strength   said Leslie Berlin  the author of Troublemakers  a history of Silicon Valley She said the defections she sees now are historically unique  The Valley was founded on this notion of   We re very open     Ms  Berlin said   But the secrecy has always been there   It s been pretty much a straight line since the start of the Cold War until now   she said   This is something new  Employees may feel the freedom to rebel because of Silicon Valley s success  both technologically and financially  The technology platforms have become more powerful   and the fortunes much bigger   than the programmers ever expected  So while the industry s power disturbs them  the wealth allows them to speak out without fear of retribution  Ms  Berlin said  It s the shadow of the success   she said   You have to understand them together  Certainly  not everyone is critical  Mr  Acton s WhatsApp co founder  Jan Koum  is on the Facebook board of directors and remains deeply active on the platform  regularly posting pro President Trump and anti immigration news And when former leaders have spoken out with criticisms of Facebook  the company has often responded aggressively  They do yell   said Roger McNamee  an early investor and adviser to Mark Zuckerberg  referring to Facebook leadership s approach But the culture of fear that the company has fostered among employees is not working anymore  he said  Facebook is at one of those moments where everybody who works there has to ask which side of history do you want to be on   Mr  McNamee said   The facts are not only indisputable  they re not even complete  It s going to get worse  
Good Tuesday  Here s what we re watching    What to expect from Powell s first Fed meeting   Trump  tariffs and the G20   Pressure continues to mount on Facebook   Facebook had a terrible day   So did Uber   Leaders at the G 20 summit are still trying to avert a trade war Get this in your inbox each morning  Sign up here Federal Reserve policymakers conclude their March rate setting meeting on Wednesday  It is the first such session with Jerome H  Powell as the central bank s new chairman With the job market tight and inflation picking up only gradually  the Fed is widely expected to raise rates by a quarter of a percentage point in what is likely to be the first of three rate increases this year After the meeting  Mr  Powell will hold his first news conference in his new role  where observers will be listening closely for any suggestion that the Fed might depart from its anticipated path  and  if so  why Here s a look at what economists and money managers are expecting Jan Hatzius  Goldman Sachs   Public remarks by Fed officials suggest a broad shift in the committee s outlook towards a potentially faster pace of tightening  and we expect the median dot to show four hikes in 2018  up from three at the December meeting  Additional hawkish changes a move to three hikes in 2019 or an increase in the longer run funds rate estimates are also possible but not our base case  Michelle Meyer  Bank of America Merrill Lynch  Ms  Meyer says she expects the Fed raise rates this meeting  but  unlike December where there were two dissents  we expect this decision to be unanimous given the shift in voters this year in the hawkish direction  The focus will be on the evolution of the dots  we look for the median to hold at three hikes for this year  but to shift up from two to three hikes in 2019  We also think the long run dot will edge up to 2 875   This would show a Fed that is more confident about its ability to deliver rate hikes  but without an urgency to front load the tightening  Ian Shepherdson  Pantheon Macroeconomics  Mr  Powell  is bound to be faced with questions along the lines of  Why are you not raising the dots in the wake of the substantial  unfunded fiscal easing    His reply  we suspect  will be something like   It s not our job to tell Congress how to conduct fiscal policy  and it s too soon to assess the impact of the tax cuts and spending increases  Much of the easing of policy could be saved rather than spent  and there are encouraging signs that productivity is picking up  so any upturn in wage growth as a result of fiscal loosening need not necessarily generate higher inflation  In any event  with inflation well below target  gradual normalization is the best way to balance the risks of both future inflation and the premature ending of the cycle via excessive tightening  Stephen Stanley  Amherst Pierpont   The bulk of the interest in this week s F O M C  meeting will come from the updated dot and economic projections as well as any meaningful tweaks to the key elements of the F O M C  statement  Any changes to the dots and statement language are likely to be in the hawkish direction  though I would expect that the new information will be more evolutionary than a radically different  Steve Rick  CUNA Mutual Group  There is  a very strong case for not only raising rates this week  but potentially doing so in a more aggressive manner than previously forecasted at the end of 2017  I think we could see projections get updated to call for four hikes instead of three  with plans for lifting rates more in coming years as well  Chris Zaccarelli  Independent Advisor Alliance   Whether we have 3 or 4 rate hikes this year shouldn t be that big of a difference to the economy  but it WILL have a big impact on market prices and market psychology  Every statement   whether spoken or written   will be highly scrutinized looking for clues as to whether the Fed Funds rate will be 1  higher  or only 75 bps  a year from now  President Trump s plan to hit countries around the world with stiff tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum has dominated a gathering of world economic leaders amid fears that the United States is on the cusp of starting an international trade war On Monday  Steven Mnuchin  the United States Treasury secretary  was peppered with requests from several countries for exemptions from the tariffs  which are being imposed in the name of national security In an interview on the sidelines of the meeting  Mr  Mnuchin suggested exemptions to the tariffs could be announced  relatively quickly  Mr  Mnuchin said Mr  Trump has already said he would exempt Canada and Mexico from the tariffs upon a successful renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement  and he has indicated that other countries could also get exemptions  But the United States has yet to detail exactly what would qualify a country for an exemption  other than a vague reference to protecting the United States  national security and reducing bilateral trade deficits Countries including France  Argentina and South Korea pressed Mr  Mnuchin on Monday about being freed from the metals tariffs  arguing that  as United States allies  they should not be penalized on national security grounds  Mr  Mnuchin said that decisions were being made on a case by case basis and that there was not a one size fits all approach to deciding which countries would be exempt  The tariffs go into effect on Friday   Alan RappeportThe Federal Trade Commission has opened an investigation into whether Facebook violated an agreement with the agency on data privacy  reports Cecilia Kang of the NYT The probe comes after reports that information on 50 million users was improperly obtained by the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica  according to a person with knowledge of the inquiry The investigation  started in recent days  adds to the mounting pressureagainst Facebook in the United States and in the United Kingdom about its handling of the data  Cambridge Analytica used the information to help President Trump s presidential campaign profile voters during the 2016 election

WASHINGTON   For 10 days  Mark Zuckerberg  Facebook s chief executive  has been under increasing pressure from lawmakers and regulators to answer questions about the improper harvesting of data of 50 million Facebook users by a British political consulting firm  Cambridge Analytica Now Mr  Zuckerberg plans to go to Washington to explain himself The chief executive has agreed to testify in at least one congressional hearing over the social network s handling of customer data  according to people familiar with the decision  Specifically  he plans to appear next month before the House Energy and Commerce Committee  said the people  who asked not to be identified because the arrangements were not public  Mr  Zuckerberg may make other appearances  he has also been asked to testify before the Senate and House Judiciary and Commerce Committees His appearing on Capitol Hill could create a spectacle that is replayed online and on television for years to come  especially amid a backlash against the power of tech behemoths  Late last year  executives from Facebook  Google and Twitter showed up at congressional hearings to discuss Russian meddling online in the 2016 presidential election  putting faces to the tech platforms during criticism of their misuse Congressional testimony by Silicon Valley chief executives is rare  and their appearances have each set off a media circus  In 2013  Apple s chief executive  Timothy D  Cook  addressed senators about his company s tax practices  In 2011  Google s chairman at the time  Eric Schmidt  spoke about the company s search practices in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee  And in 1998  Bill Gates  who was Microsoft s chief executive  defended his company against lawmakers  assertions that he was building a monopoly   an argument he eventually lost in court  The committee is continuing to work with Facebook to determine a day and time for Mr  Zuckerberg to testify   said Elena Hernandez  a spokeswoman for the House Energy and Commerce Committee CNN earlier reported that Mr  Zuckerberg had decided to testify in front of Congress He has been under pressure to appear before Congress since reports on March 17 that Cambridge Analytica improperly obtained and used the data of 50 million Facebook users  The revelations immediately sparked a furor on both sides of the Atlantic  with regulators in Britain and the United States calling for Mr  Zuckerberg to discuss what happened Those calls haven t subsided  even though the chief executive issued a public statement last week outlining the steps that Facebook was taking to prevent improper  harvesting of the data of its 2 2  billion users  On Monday  the Federal Trade Commission confirmed that it was investigating how Facebook handles information about its users  Politicians including Senator Charles E  Grassley  Republican of Iowa  have also pressed for Mr  Zuckerberg to appear on Capitol Hill Mr  Zuckerberg has turned down some requests to go before lawmakers  He declined to appear this week before the British Parliament and answer questions about data privacy Facebook staff have held marathon meetings and phone calls with staff from congressional committees over the past week  according to Facebook employees and others briefed on the matter  Rob Sherman  Facebook s deputy chief privacy officer  and Molly Cutler  its associate general counsel  have met with staff from the House and Senate Commerce  Judiciary and Intelligence Committees  they said Mr  Zuckerberg initially resisted speaking to Congress  and had asked if a senior Facebook executive could be sent to represent the company in his name  two Facebook employees familiar with the conversations said After the public outcry over Facebook s data and privacy settings  Mr  Zuckerberg was persuaded that he needed to appear  they said  In recent days  he told Facebook employees that he had come to understand he would have to testify In an interview with CNN last week  Mr  Zuckerberg said that he would be  happy to  testify in front of Congress and that  it s the right thing to do   He added of Cambridge Analytica   This was a major breach of trust  and I m really sorry that this happened  Google and Twitter have also been called to testify before Congress on data privacy  The companies didn t respond to requests for comment Lawmakers have been frustrated in the past by Mr  Zuckerberg s absence from hearings  Last year  Facebook sent its general counsel  Colin Stretch  to join lawyers from Twitter and Google to testify about social media s role in spreading disinformation during the 2016 election  Lawmakers noted the absence of senior executives  including Mr  Zuckerberg  and repeatedly challenged Facebook to send its leaders to answer questions In a recent interview  Senator John Kennedy  Republican of Louisiana  said Mr  Zuckerberg needed to directly answer questions from Congress about what kind of user data was being gathered and shared  because Facebook has been too vague about its practices  He said the attorneys for Facebook  Google and Twitter who testified about the 2016 election had  dodged questions   They didn t say a damn thing  which was what they were paid to do   Mr  Kennedy said   I d encourage Mr  Zuckerberg to do the common sense thing and roll up his sleeves and take a meaningful amount of time talking to us about this  
WASHINGTON   Federal regulators and state prosecutors are opening investigations into Facebook  Politicians in the United States and Europe are calling for its chief executive  Mark Zuckerberg  to testify before them  Investors have cut the value of the social networking giant by about  50 billion in the past two days They are all focused on the same thing  whether Facebook mishandled users  data Facebook has built its highly profitable social network off its users  selling advertisements based on their ages  interests and other details  But the scrutiny over the company s vast trove of personal data   following a report that a political consulting firm had improperly obtained information of 50 million users   is taking direct aim at that lucrative formula  Investors are reacting to fears of regulation and the consequences of regulation   said Brian Wieser  a senior research analyst at Pivotal Research Group   The scale of errors can only lead one to conclude these are systemic problems  So far  most of the social network s top executives have been silent  Mr  Zuckerberg  its founder  and Sheryl Sandberg  his top deputy  have not made any public statements in recent days  The pair did not appear at an employee meeting on Tuesday in Menlo Park  Calif   where the company is based At the meeting  employees asked questions about the continuing internal investigation into the use of Facebook data by the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica  The firm  which was tied to President Trump s 2016 campaign  used the data to target messages to voters The meeting  which included Facebook s deputy counsel  Paul Grewal  largely focused on the steps that Facebook was taking to ensure its data could no longer be misused by independent researchers  according to Facebook employees in attendance  Mr  Zuckerberg was expected to address employees on Friday  when the company holds an all hands meeting The company has faced internal dissent over its broader role in spreading disinformation during the presidential campaign and its response to it  The tensions have prompted the planned departure of Alex Stamos  Facebook s chief security officer  who plans to leave in August The pressure on Facebook has been building for years It started in the European Union  where regulators have taken an aggressive attitude toward Facebook and other American technology giants for their sway over the region s 500 million people  The company has been the subject of several privacy investigations and charges by European regulators  Europe has approved a new privacy law  which takes effect in May  that will give users of Facebook  Google and other internet services more control over how their data is collected and what Silicon Valley companies know about them After the 2016 presidential campaign  lawmakers at home joined the chorus of critics  citing the company s role in Russia s disinformation efforts  The social network was one of the top tools used by Russians to spread false news  and the company s executives have struggled to explain what happened and how they would prevent foreign interference in the future The Cambridge Analytica revelations have forced Facebook to scramble to assuage fresh concerns by regulators and lawmakers  The company is sending its representatives to Capitol Hill and arranging conversations with state attorneys general to try to answer questions about how the firm collected the information of Facebook users The social networking giant is also facing an investigation by the Federal Trade Commission  which is looking into whether Facebook violated an agreement with the agency  according to a person with knowledge of the inquiry The F T C  investigation is connected to a settlement the agency reached with Facebook in 2011 after finding that the company had told users that third party apps on the social media site  like games  would not be allowed to access their data  But the apps  the agency found  were able to obtain almost all personal information about a user The current investigation has parallels  The information on the 50 million users was harvested in 2014 by an outside researcher  Aleksandr Kogan  Mr  Kogan  a professor at Cambridge University  paid users small sums to take a personality quiz and download an app  which collected private information from their profiles and from those of their friends  Facebook allowed that sort of data collection at the time Then  Mr  Kogan gave the information to Cambridge Analytica  a firm founded by Stephen K  Bannon  the former White House political adviser  and Robert Mercer  the wealthy Republican donor  Passing the information to a third party violated Facebook s policies  the company said last week  There are all sorts of obligations under the consent decree that may not have been honored here   said David Vladeck  a former director of consumer protection at the F T C The company could face fines of  40 000 a day per violation if the agency finds that Facebook broke the agreement  We are aware of the issues that have been raised but cannot comment on whether we are investigating   an F T C  spokeswoman said in a statement on Tuesday   We take any allegations of violations of our consent decrees very seriously  Facebook said it expected to receive questions from the F T C  related to potential violations of the 2011 consent decree   We remain strongly committed to protecting people s information   Facebook s deputy chief privacy officer  Rob Sherman  said in a statement   We appreciate the opportunity to answer questions the F T C  may have  The F T C  inquiry is just one piece of the regulatory backlash  On Tuesday  the New York attorney general  Eric T  Schneiderman  announced that he was joining the Massachusetts attorney general  Maura Healey  in an investigation into whether Facebook had failed to protect the privacy of users in those states  New Jersey s attorney general announced a similar investigation Mr  Schneiderman and Ms  Healey sent a letter to Facebook on Tuesday that demanded records of the communications between the company and Cambridge Analytica  Consumers have a right to know how their information is used   and companies like Facebook have a fundamental responsibility to protect their users  personal information   Mr  Schneiderman said   Today s demand letter is the first step in our joint investigation to get to the bottom of what happened  There have also been growing calls for the top leadership at Facebook to appear before American and British lawmakers to testify about the company and Cambridge Analytica Senators Amy Klobuchar  Democrat of Minnesota  and John Kennedy  Republican of Louisiana  have asked the chairman of the Judiciary Committee  Charles E  Grassley  Republican of Iowa  to hold a hearing  Republican leaders of the Senate Commerce Committee  organized by John Thune of South Dakota  wrote a letter on Monday to Mr  Zuckerberg demanding answers to questions about how the data had been collected and if users were able to control the misuse of data by third parties  It s time for Mr  Zuckerberg and the other C E O s to testify before Congress   Senator Mark Warner  Democrat of Virginia  said on Tuesday   The American people deserve answers about social media manipulation in the 2016 election  Facebook staff members were scheduled to brief the office of Mr  Warner  the top Democrat on the Intelligence committee  and the offices of members of other committees  including Commerce  this week  The possibility that Facebook has either not been transparent with consumers or has not been able to verify that third party app developers are transparent with consumers is troubling   Mr  Thune said in his letter On Tuesday morning  a committee within the British Parliament sent a letter to Mr  Zuckerberg that asked him to appear before the panel to answer questions on the company s connection to Cambridge Analytica  The president of the European Parliament also requested an appearance by Mr  Zuckerberg  The committee has repeatedly asked Facebook about how companies acquire and hold on to user data from their site  and in particular about whether data had been taken without their consent   wrote Damian Collins  chairman of the British committee   Your officials  answers have consistently understated this risk  and have been misleading to the committee  
In the wake of news that the Facebook data of 50 million people was obtained by Cambridge Analytica  a political data firm  many users are mulling whether it is time to leave the social network  Even a co founder of WhatsApp  which Facebook bought for  16 billion in 2014  declared that it was time to delete Facebook But while deleting your account is as simple as clicking on a few buttons  Facebook may be too ubiquitous to truly quit  For one  it would probably be inaccurate to say you have removed Facebook from your life just by leaving the site  Chances are you still use WhatsApp  the largest messaging app in the world  or Instagram  the most popular photo sharing app  Facebook owns both Keep in mind that Facebook isn t the only company capable of collecting your information  One big culprit  Web trackers  like cookies embedded into websites and their ads  They are everywhere  and they follow your activities from site to site You can quit Facebook if you simply find no joy in it  But if you re looking to leave for philosophical reasons concerning privacy  it s a futile effort  You may be better off tweaking your privacy settings on the site Here are some answers to questions that many people are posing to The New York Times via social media What are the alternatives to using Facebook  Instagram and WhatsApp There is no real substitute for Facebook if you re looking for a social network that includes virtually everyone you meet in real life  Social networks are all about the people on them  and Facebook has more than 2 billion monthly users  You could consider Snapchat  which has about 187 million daily users  but it s a far different experience   you primarily use it to send photos that self destruct   with an interface that many people find confusing There are plenty of alternatives to WhatsApp  But they have drawbacks and aren t as far reaching as WhatsApp  which has more than 1 5 billion monthly users Signal is a solid app for secure encrypted messaging   but it is still a young service with a relatively small number of users  You might be able to get hundreds of your friends to join Signal  But chances are you have friends or family in other countries  and WhatsApp is the go to messaging service internationally  For example  practically every smartphone user in India   more than 200 million people   uses WhatsApp Another WhatsApp alternative is WeChat  a Chinese messaging app that has about a billion monthly users  But the majority of people on that service are in China  And WeChat faces its own privacy issues because of China s notorious reputation for mass surveillance  Tencent  the company that runs WeChat  denies that it stores the chat histories of its users  But WeChat users have been arrested over conversations they have had in the app  and chat transcripts have been used as evidence in court proceedings Instagram  which has more than 800 million monthly users  is also a tough one  giving Facebook a stranglehold on photo sharing  The only real competitor to Instagram is Facebook itself  which has its own photo sharing features  Remember Flickr  The Yahoo owned site is the closest thing either has to a competitor  and it s like a graveyard of people s digital memories before they abandoned it for Facebook and Instagram Google Photos is a compelling service  but it is a photo album management tool  not so much a social network How else do you keep in touch with friends and family  How do you create and discover events  How do you market and manage customer service for your small business  How do you spark and build grass roots movements Facebook is the one stop shop to accomplish all those tasks  But if you have the patience  you can juggle multiple apps to cobble together the same experience Messaging apps are popular for keeping in touch with friends and family   a group chat between family members via text message  for example  is still an efficient way to keep in touch  And sites like MeetUp are designed for hosting and discovering events As for customer service  many companies use Twitter to engage with their customers and resolve complaints  Yelp  the reviews site for local businesses  is a common place for customers to talk about their experiences  and business owners often engage with people there For grass roots movements  a Twitter hashtag might be enough  Recent examples include  metoo  the movement for people to discuss sexual assault   deleteuber  the campaign to protest Uber last year amid political controversy  and now  there is the movement to  deletefacebook in response to the Cambridge Analytica controversy What does it mean to delete Facebook  How can you actually delete your account You can permanently delete your account by clicking a few buttons on Facebook s website  The company delays deletion for a few days  so do not log back in  Facebook also offers a tool for extracting a copy of your data before deleting your account After you delete your account  it won t be recoverable  But there are caveats Shadows of your digital self would remain on the site  For example  if people uploaded photos of you  those photos will still be there  The conversations you had with friends through Facebook won t disappear  either When you delete your account  you are only deleting the media you posted  like your status updates and photos that you uploaded  That s not going to do much for your privacy  considering that an overwhelming amount of what you do on Facebook involves engaging with other people  All of your friends  and their friends  too  would also have to delete their accounts in order to have any sort of meaningful effect What other things are you losing access to if you delete Facebook  Why do so many apps require a Facebook login One painful part of breaking up with Facebook would be potentially losing access to the many third party apps and websites that are tied to your account  Over the past decade  many shopping sites and apps teamed up with Facebook to use the company s login tool  Facebook Login Facebook Login became popular because it was a good product  By clicking a button  you could sign up for an account with an app or website just by sharing your Facebook account data  That allowed you to skip manually entering details like your name and email address   a process that is especially cumbersome on a small smartphone screen  This sped up the process of signing up for an account to buy that pair of shoes you saw go on sale If you were to delete Facebook  you would break your access to many sites and apps that you signed up for using Facebook Login  But fortunately  many sites and apps still let you sign up for accounts directly through them  and many also let you log in through your Google account It s not impossible to delete Facebook  But it would be a long and tedious process to create new accounts for all the apps and sites you use Where does Facebook really equal the internet Keep in mind that Facebook reaches well beyond the United States  As my colleague Sheera Frenkel noted on Twitter  deleting Facebook is a privilege  In some parts of the world  like Myanmar  Egypt and Indonesia  people rely on Facebook as a primary means to conduct business and stay in touch with friends and family  In Africa  Facebook has struck deals that offer basic services   centered on those provided by Facebook   to residents for free 
LONDON    The computer expert who alleges a trove of Facebook data was improperly used to help Donald Trump s White House bid said Tuesday that he strongly believes the information was also used by the Brexit movement that persuaded Britain to quit the European Union In a 3  hour hearing  Chris Wylie told the House of Commons media committee that he believes the breach exceeded the 50 million Facebook users reported earlier   though he didn t give an exact figure  And he said the data compiled by the political consulting business Cambridge Analytica was available to other firms with links to it  All kinds of people had access to the data   said Wylie  who helped develop Cambridge Analytica s methods for using the information to target and persuade voters   It was everywhere  Among the companies that had access to the data was AggregateIQ  a Canadian political consultant that did work for Vote Leave  the official campaign backing Britain s withdrawal from the EU  Wylie said Wylie described Cambridge Analytica as just one arm of a global company  SCL Group  that gets most of its income from military contracts but is also a political gun for hire  often in countries where democratic institutions are weak  He suggested the company combines computer algorithms and dirty tricks to help candidates win regardless of the cost The 28 year old Canadian with a swath of pink hair says he helped set up Cambridge Analytica in 2013  He left the next year Wylie has previously alleged that Cambridge Analytica used personal data improperly collected from Facebook users to help Trump s 2016 presidential campaign Cambridge Analytica says none of the Facebook data was used in its work on the Trump campaign  It denies any wrongdoing Cambridge Analytica s acting CEO  Alexander Tayler  said in a statement that Wylie was a part time contractor who  has no direct knowledge of our work or practices  since he left the company Wylie said he  absolutely  believes AggregateIQ drew on Cambridge Analytica s databases for its work on the Brexit campaign  In the closely fought referendum in 2016  51 9 percent of voters backed Britain s departure from the EU  I think it is incredibly reasonable to say that AIQ played a very significant role in Leave winning   Wylie said He testified that AggregateIQ was formed when Cambridge Analytica sought to expand but Canadians he wanted to bring into the business didn t want to relocate to Britain  The two firms shared underlying technology and worked so closely together that Cambridge Analytica staff often referred to the Canadian firm as a  department   he said Because of the links between the two companies  Vote Leave got the  the next best thing  to Cambridge Analytica when it hired AggregateIQ   a company that can do virtually everything that  Cambridge Analytica  can do but with a different billing name   Wylie said AggregateIQ  based in Victoria  British Columbia  issued a statement saying it has never been part of Cambridge Analytica or SCL  AggregateIQ works in full compliance within all legal and regulatory requirements in all jurisdictions where it operates   the company said   All work AggregateIQ does for each client is kept separate from every other client  Wylie s testimony came a day after Wylie and two other former insiders presented 50 pages of documents that they said proved Vote Leave violated election finance rules during the referendum campaign They allege that Vote Leave circumvented spending limits by donating 625 000 pounds   888 000  to the pro Brexit student group BeLeave  which then sent the money directly to AggregateIQ Vote Leave denies breaking any campaign finance regulations  Dominic Cummings  the Vote Leave strategist  called Wylie a  fantasist charlatan  
LONDON    A Cambridge Analytica whistleblower said on Tuesday that Canadian company AggregateIQ worked on software called Ripon which was used to identify Republican voters ahead of the 2016 U S  presidential election AggregateIQ did not immediately respond to request for comment on the remarks by Christopher Wylie  a whistleblower formerly of British political consultancy Cambridge Analytica Wylie has previously disclosed how users  data from Facebook was used by Cambridge Analytica to help elect U S  President Donald Trump Ripon  the town in which the Republican Party was founded in 1854  was the name given to a tool that let a campaign manage its voter database  target specific voters  conduct canvassing  manage fundraising and carry out surveys  There s now tangible proof in the public domain that AIQ actually built Ripon  which is the software that utilised the algorithms from the Facebook data   Wylie told the British Parliament s Digital  Culture  Media and Sport Committee AggregateIQ told Reuters on March 24 that it had never been and is not a part of Cambridge Analytica nor ever entered into a contract with Cambridge Analytica It said it works in full compliance within all legal and regulatory requirements and had never knowingly been involved in any illegal activity Cambridge Analytica said on Tuesday that it had not shared any of the Facebook profile data procured by a Cambridge academic with AggregateIQ  It said it had not had any communication with AggregateIQ since December 2015  Reporting by Alistair Smout  Andy Bruce and Eric Auchard  editing by Guy Faulconbridge

 Reuters    The European Commission pressed Facebook on Monday over whether EU citizens  data were among those improperly harvested by a British political consultancy  after the U S  regulator said it was investigating the firm s privacy practices That piled yet more pressure on a firm that has lost more than  100 billion in market value in the last 10 days Facebook shares fell more than 5 percent on Monday after the U S  consumer protection regulator made public its investigation of how the social network allowed data of 50 million users to get into the hands of Cambridge Analytica Facebook executives have apologized after reports emerged that Cambridge Analytica had used personal data to target U S  voters  Have any data of EU citizens been affected by the recent scandal   EU Justice Commissioner Vera Jourova wrote in a letter to Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg  seen by Reuters   If this is the case  how do you intend to inform the authorities and users about it  Jourova said that statements by Facebook executives had not alleviated her concerns  This is particularly disappointing given our efforts to build a relationship based on trust with you and your colleagues     this trust is now diminished  A Facebook spokeswoman said the company remained strongly committed to protecting people s information and appreciated  the opportunity to explain what we know and will respond to the questions that the Commissioner has asked  Jourova asked Sandberg whether she was certain that a similar situation could  not be repeated today  and if she thought stricter rules were needed for platforms  like those that exist for traditional media   As Mark Zuckerberg said this week  we are working hard to tackle past abuse  prevent future abuse and give people more prominent controls   the Facebook spokeswoman said Germany s justice minister called for stricter rules for Facebook after meeting with company executives on Monday who said around 1 percent of 300 000 users of a personality quiz whose results were later fed into Cambridge Analytica s voter targeting algorithms were in Europe Jourova said she wanted a reply to her letter within two weeks The Cambridge Analytica scandal emerged only a few months before a landmark EU data protection law comes into force under which companies found to be in breach could be fined up to 4 percent of global turnover Any eventual sanctions for Facebook will fall under the current privacy regulations  and so would be much lower Britain s data watchdog is taking the lead in investigating Facebook and Cambridge Analytica from the European side  and Jourova said she expected the social network to cooperate fully with European data protection authorities  Reporting by Julia Fioretti  Editing by Andrew Roche and David Evans

Facebook said it would roll out a centralized system for its users to control their privacy and security settings in response to an outcry over the way it has handled personal data The system  which will be introduced to Facebook users globally over the coming weeks  will allow people to change their privacy and security settings from one place rather than having to go to roughly 20 separate sections across the social media platform From the new page  users can control the personal information the social network keeps on them  such as their political preferences or interests  and download and review a file of data Facebook has collected about them  Facebook also will clarify what types of apps people are currently using and what permissions those apps have to gather their information Facebook began developing the centralized system last year but sped it up after revelations that a British political consulting firm  Cambridge Analytica  improperly harvested the information of 50 million users of the social network  The amount of data Cambridge Analytica obtained about Facebook users reawakened fears over how much information the social network has gathered about people  leading to a  DeleteFacebook movement and other criticism  The last week showed how much more work we need to do to enforce our policies  and to help people understand how Facebook works and the choices they have over their data   Erin Egan  Facebook s chief privacy officer  and Ashlie Beringer  a Facebook deputy general counsel  said in a statement announcing the new system   We ve heard loud and clear that privacy settings and other important tools are too hard to find  and that we must do more to keep people informed  The Cambridge Analytica scandal has plunged Facebook into its worst crisis in years  with regulators and lawmakers in the United States and Britain demanding answers about how the social network deals with data privacy  Mark Zuckerberg  Facebook s chief executive  has agreed to appear in front of lawmakers on Capitol Hill next month  people familiar with the decision have said Last week  Mr  Zuckerberg said in a statement that Facebook had to do better with user data and promised to roll out products that give users more control over their information and privacy settings  One of our biggest responsibilities is to protect data   he told The New York Times last week   Whenever there s an issue where someone s data gets passed to someone who the rules of the system shouldn t have allowed it to  that s rightfully a big issue and deserves to be a big uproar Late Wednesday  Facebook also said that it was halting its practice of allowing advertisers to target ads using information from third party data brokers  These are business to business companies that can collect a vast range of details about individual consumers such as their shopping habits  health concerns  income range and preferred credit card The social network had previously allowed advertisers to use consumer details from data brokers like Experian  Acxiom and Oracle s Datalogix unit to help target ads to Facebook users  But Facebook said it was now mothballing that option  called  Partner Categories   We want to let advertisers know that we will be shutting down Partner Categories   Graham Mudd  a product marketing director at Facebook  said in a statement  This product enables third party data providers to offer their targeting directly on Facebook   he added   While this is common industry practice  we believe this step  winding down over the next six months  will help improve people s privacy on Facebook  In 2012  the Federal Trade Commission opened an inquiry into data brokers and subsequently recommended that Congress consider enacting a law  to make data broker practices more visible to consumers and to give consumers greater control over the immense amounts of personal information about them collected and shared by data brokers  How much of a difference these actions may make to Facebook s data privacy practices was unclear  Some privacy advocates noted  for instance  that the company s new centralized privacy and security settings page has been tried in the past  The platform made similar promises many times before   said Zeynep Tufekci  an associate professor at the University of North Carolina who studies how technology affects society  She pointed out that in 2010  Mr  Zuckerberg said in The Washington Post that Facebook users needed simpler controls over their privacy and had promised then that Facebook would  add privacy controls that are much simpler to use  Yet eight years later  the same concerns have resurfaced  Ms  Tufekci said  The past decade shows that user concerns over privacy appear to have little teeth on changing how the platform behaves  aside from a recycling of contrite statements and promises to do better from its C E O    she said 
NEW YORK    Some 60 companies including such leading brands as Subway  Sprint and the NFL are joining forces to help each other follow you around online Adobe  a company better known for Photoshop and PDF files  says the new Device Co op initiative it is organizing will help companies offer more personalized experiences and make ads less annoying by filtering out products and services you have already bought or will never buy  Under the initiative  Adobe can tell you re the same person on a home PC  a work laptop  a phone and a tablet by analyzing past sign ins with member companies The initiative comes amid heightened privacy sensitivities after reports that Facebook allowed a political consulting firm  Cambridge Analytica  to harvest data on millions of Facebook users to influence elections  Facebook also has been criticized for collecting call and text logs from phones running Google s Android system Adobe s initiative underscores the role data plays in helping companies make money  Many of the initial uses are for better ad targeting The company timed Wednesday s announcement to a digital marketing conference it is hosting this week in Las Vegas  Adobe executives said they believed their initiative offers strong privacy safeguards and weren t worried about a backlash in light of the Facebook scandal  With this stuff coming out now around Cambridge Analytica and Facebook  the bar has to be so high in terms of privacy   Adobe executive Amit Ahuja said Adobe says no personal data is being exchanged among participating companies  which also include Allstate  Lenovo  Intel  Barnes   Noble  Subaru and the Food Network  Adobe says the program links about 300 million consumers across nearly 2 billion devices in the U S  and Canada The program would let Sprint  for instance  know that Bob is already a customer when he visits from a new device  Bob wouldn t get a promotion to switch from another carrier  but might get instead a phone upgrade offer  Or if Mary has declared herself a Giants fan on the NFL s app  she might see ads with Giants banners when visiting NFL com from a laptop for the first time All this might feel creepy  but such cross device tracking is already commonly done by matching attributes such as devices that from the same internet location  or IP address  Consumers typically have little control over it Adobe says it will give consumers a chance to opt out of such tracking  And it s breaking industry practices in a few ways  Adobe says it will honor opt out requests for all participating companies and for all devices at once  It s more typical for such setups to require people do so one by one  All companies in the initiative are listed on Adobe s website  a break from some companies  practice of referring only to unspecified partners  We re doing everything we can not letting brands hide themselves   Ahuja said But in taking an opt out approach  which is common in the industry  Adobe assumes that users consent  And it places the burden on consumers to learn about this initiative and to figure out how they can opt out of it

JERUSALEM    Israel announced Wednesday it was launching a domestic digital health database that could make it a global medical powerhouse  The move aims to improve public health worldwide but critics warn it risks compromising personal privacy Eli Groner  director general of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu s office  said the system could help prevent disease by pairing each individual with his or her own relevant data  With easy access to a person s medical history  he said it may be possible to become informed of a looming disease before one actually contracts it  The database will be unlike anything in the world   Groner said If successful   something he said depends on the number of those willing to participate   the database could be shared with medical researchers globally and help diagnose trends and help develop better medication worldwide Groner said the launch is expected by the end of 2018  stressing that divulging data depends on individual consent and that teams are now hammering out details on how to ensure maximum privacy The innovation is possible in part because of Israel s relatively small size and already centralized health care system  Most of the country s 8 7 million citizens are members of four main health care providers  which have been maintaining their records digitally for years  The new database aims to collect all the information in one place At his weekly Cabinet meeting  Netanyahu said Sunday the  275 million project is of  historic significance  and that its goal is to improve  preventive medicine  and also achieve  personal medicine  personally calibrated for each person  The announcement comes as Facebook s privacy practices have come under fire following revelations that it failed to prevent the data mining firm Cambridge Analytica from amassing personal information about millions of users and that the social network has been collecting Android users  phone call and text message histories without notice Critics say the selling of medical records for profit could spell disaster for patient confidentiality Tehilla Shwartz Altshuler  a senior fellow at the Israel Democracy Institute  said even data entered anonymously does not guarantee long term confidentiality and it is unclear what uses will be made in the future with data disclosed now  Medical records are the most private information you could think about  it includes DNA  bloodwork  all medical history   she said   Stuff you may not want insurance companies  employers  spouses  whoever to know   you don t even want Facebook to know so that it won t be able to mesh it up with other information it has about you  
NEW YORK    Fair housing advocates sued Facebook Tuesday  saying it lets landlords and real estate brokers target advertising to discriminate against women  those with disabilities and families with children The lawsuit in Manhattan federal court alleges investigations by fair housing supporters in New York  Washington  D C   Miami and San Antonio  Texas  prove Facebook continues to let advertisers discriminate even though civil rights and housing groups have notified the company since 2016 that it is violating the federal Fair Housing Act  It seeks unspecified damages and a court order to end discrimination Facebook said in a statement that the lawsuit is without merit and the company will defend itself vigorously  There is absolutely no place for discrimination on Facebook   the company said The lawsuit was filed by the National Fair Housing Alliance and other organizations  It comes as Facebook faces criticism over allegations British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica used details of 50 million Facebook users to help Republican candidate Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential campaign The housing groups say the Menlo Park  California based Facebook abused its power as it became what amounts to the biggest advertising agency in the world The lawsuit s explanation of how the discrimination is carried out begins with a description that would sound appealing to most advertisers  It said Facebook  with a customer base of over 2 billion people  collects a  treasure trove of information  to enable advertisers to target customers they believe are right for their businesses Then it lets advertisers scroll through hundreds of demographics  behaviors and interests to decide which characteristics they want to include or exclude  the lawsuit said The lawsuit said that the National Fair Housing Alliance did its own study after the investigative news nonprofit ProPublica published an article in October 2016 that said Facebook s online platform enabled advertisers to exclude from advertisements in the housing category those customers assigned black  Hispanic and other  ethnic affinities  It said the housing alliance was able to post a Facebook ad for a fictitious rental apartment after it selected options that excluded blacks and Hispanics from the ad s potential audience  After complaints  Facebook took steps to counter those kinds of discriminatory ads  the lawsuit said But it said additional work by ProPublica and the housing alliance revealed that as recently as weeks ago the company was approving advertising that  in effect  discriminated against mothers  families with young children and those with disabilities  Although Facebook stopped approving housing advertisements that used its  ethnic affinity  option in late 2017  it continues to create and develop content that facilitates advertisers excluding certain audiences based on legally protected characteristics   the lawsuit said It said Facebook from Dec  14 to Feb  23 had accepted 40 advertisements that the housing alliance and affiliates created that excluded potential home seekers based on family status or gender 
GENEVA    The scandal over data privacy that is causing a headache for Facebook Inc shows just one aspect of the huge task of preparing the world for e commerce  the United Nations trade and development agency UNCTAD said on Wednesday Facebook has faced a global outcry and its shares have slid in value after a whistleblower said data from millions of users was improperly harvested by consultancy Cambridge Analytica to target U S  and British voters  The current debate about Facebook and data privacy vividly illustrates that most countries are ill prepared for the digital economy   UNCTAD Secretary General Mukhisa Kituyi said in a statement Data privacy is just one of many boxes that national regulators need to tick if they hope to get a handle on e commerce  UNCTAD s head of internet and computer technology analysis Torbjörn Fredriksson told a news conference Other issues include legal questions related to e transactions and e signatures  consumer protection online  data protection  cybercrime  taxation and domain names  Then you look at trade logistics  especially to try to address what we call the tsunami of parcels  when people start ordering from online platforms instead of going to the retail shop that has bought everything in bulk   he said In developing countries  internet purchases are still mainly paid for with cash on delivery  and central banks and finance ministries need to help ensure access to online payment systems  Fredriksson added But most developing countries are still unclear about whose job it is to coordinate e commerce  he said Without online payments  local firms would struggle to export on international e commerce platforms such as Amazon and Alibaba  while the flood of imports risks creating a trade imbalance  There is some concern that     there is a risk of concentration of markets among the big platforms   Fredriksson said  adding that UNCTAD was working on ways to address the problem Although rich countries are thinking about how they need to adapt  poorer countries are largely flying blind  with no data for example on e commerce circumventing national trade rules  which could help the traffic in counterfeit goods  There are concerns about jobs that may be lost  taxation  customs revenue  there s a whole range of issues that are challenges more than opportunities perhaps   Fredriksson said  Governments are increasingly looking at it  but whether they are looking at it enough is another issue   Reporting by Tom Miles  Editing by Catherine Evans

Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg have clashed on artificial intelligence  space travel and the direction of technology On Friday  Mr  Musk showed just how little love lost there was between the two tech titans Mr  Musk  the chief executive of SpaceX and Tesla  deleted the Facebook pages of both of his companies  In doing so  he joined a growing chorus of tech leaders calling for people to abandon Mr  Zuckerberg s social network after it allowed a political consulting firm  Cambridge Analytica  to obtain and misuse data on 50 million users  The revelations have plunged Facebook into its worst public relations crisis in years As with most news in 2018  Mr  Musk s decision started with a barrage of tweets The tech luminary began by criticizing Sonos  a maker of wireless speakers  which had pulled some ads from Facebook for a week  Wow  a whole week  Risky       Mr  Musk tweeted in response to a news article about Sonos s move A minute later  he replied to Brian Acton  the founder of WhatsApp  which Facebook had acquired for  19 billion several years ago  Mr  Acton  who has since left Facebook  had on Wednesday called for people to   deletefacebook   What s Facebook   Mr  Musk replied to Mr  Acton  Then Mr  Musk announced he would shut down the SpaceX and Tesla pages  He said the Tesla Facebook page  looks lame anyway  The posts  which sent the Twittersphere into a virtual frenzy  escalated a public feud between Mr  Musk and Mr  Zuckerberg  Mr  Musk has often urged people to be cautious of embracing technology such as artificial intelligence because of the consequences it might bring  once saying that it could become so powerful it would start wars and turn people into its  house cats  Mr  Zuckerberg has argued that people need to trust and embrace technology in their lives  When the Facebook chief executive was asked about Mr  Musk s warnings around artificial intelligence during a Facebook Live broadcast in 2017  he called Mr  Musk a  naysayer   That s an insult in a technology world that celebrates perpetual optimism  With A I  especially  I m really optimistic   Mr  Zuckerberg said   People who are naysayers and kind of try to drum up these doomsday scenarios   I just  I don t understand it  I think it s really negative and in some ways I actually think it is pretty irresponsible  In response  Mr  Musk shot back that Mr  Zuckerberg did not fully comprehend the issues  I ve talked to Mark about this   Mr  Musk wrote   His understanding of the subject is limited  The two have also clashed on space travel  Mr  Zuckerberg traveled to Kenya in 2016 for the launch of a Facebook affiliated satellite called Amos 6  which was set to go to outer space in a SpaceX rocket  But the rocket exploded  Mr  Zuckerberg released a chilly statement  As I m here in Africa  I m deeply disappointed to hear that SpaceX s launch failure destroyed our satellite that would have provided connectivity to so many entrepreneurs and everyone else across the continent   he wrote on Facebook Mr  Musk is a frequent Twitter presence  who has posted increasingly macho and humor focused messages including video of himself playing with a flamethrower He said he plans to keep using his Instagram account  which is owned by Facebook  and on which he has 6 9 million followers When one reporter said on Twitter that it was remarkable Mr  Musk had so much time to troll online  Mr  Musk wrote   What  a troll  me   Facebook and SpaceX didn t immediately have a comment on Mr  Musk s deleted pages  A Tesla spokeswoman did not have a comment beyond Mr  Musk s tweets 
Good morning  Want to get California Today by email  Here s the sign up  Facebook has had a particularly bad few days  even for a Silicon Valley giant that has been under fire for months  The social network  which was once Silicon Valley s pride and joy  is now facing a new scandal over data privacy   and the fallout has been intense and keeps widening Let s recap how it all unfolded Over the weekend  The New York Times  along with The Observer of London and The Guardian  broke the news that a British political consulting firm  Cambridge Analytica  improperly obtained data on 50 million Facebook users and used it to target messages to potential American voters The revelations set off an immediate hue and cry  American and British lawmakers demanded that Facebook explain how the data had been harvested without people being alerted  Senator Amy Klobuchar  a Democrat from Minnesota  pressed Mark Zuckerberg  Facebook s chief executive  to appear before lawmakers in person  Others have since piled on On Monday  The Times reported that Facebook s executive in charge of information security  Alex Stamos  was planning to leave the social network by August  The move reflected heightened internal tensions at the top of the company  showing how the scrutiny has taken a toll Criticism of Facebook intensified on Tuesday  Wall Street investors sold off the company s shares  with a nearly 7 percent drop on Monday and a 2 5 percent fall on Tuesday  To top it off  the Federal Trade Commission opened an investigation into whether Facebook violated an agreement on data

Times The rain storms hitting California this week have been called many things  but two related terms keep popping up to describe this weather system   atmospheric river  and  Pineapple Express  So which one is it  Pineapple Express was a term for many years used to identify storms that came from Hawaii and hit the West Coast   said Marty Ralph  a research meteorologist affiliated with U C  San Diego s Scripps Institution of Oceanography   About 15 years ago we recognized that there s a broader definition called an atmospheric river  and those happen all over the planet  For non scientists  atmospheric rivers can be conceptualized visually  If you look from space from a satellite  it does look like a sinuous river   said Daniel Swain  a climate scientist at U C L A   It s a colorful term  and it s actually the official meteorological term to describe this process  But while all Pineapple Express storms are atmospheric rivers  not all atmospheric rivers are classified as Pineapple Express storms The source for the particular atmospheric river hitting California this week is near the Hawaiian Islands  hence the playful  Pineapple Express   Not everyone agrees  though  that this storm falls under that category  I wouldn t call this one a Pineapple Express  The storm is coming from the West  but the tail of this atmospheric river didn t come from Hawaii  it came from east of Hawaii   Mr  Ralph said   But I m not sure about arguing the jargon too much on this  The modern term is atmospheric river  Nomenclature aside  Mr  Swain urged residents in burn areas not to ignore the orders because of storm fatigue  Though the storm may not hit Los Angeles too hard  it could wallop those in Santa Barbara County  The forecast is severe  and if water falls too quickly it could lead to substantial flooding and mudslides  The forecast is for a really  really big rain   he said   Maybe half a foot or more of water is going to fall in a lot of places that have had intense fire activity  Whether all those inches of rain fall over three days or in a six hours is hard to predict  California Today goes live at 6 a m  Pacific time weekdays  Tell us what you want to see  CAtoday

NEW YORK SAN FRANCISCO    Fewer than half of Americans trust Facebook to obey U S  privacy laws  according to a Reuters Ipsos poll released on Sunday  illustrating the challenge facing the social media network after a scandal over its handling of personal information The poll  taken Wednesday through Friday  also found that fewer Americans trust Facebook than other tech companies that gather user data  such as Apple Inc  Alphabet Inc s Google  Amazon com Inc  Microsoft Corp and Yahoo Some 41 percent of Americans trust Facebook to obey laws that protect their personal information  compared with 66 percent who said they trust Amazon  62 percent who trust Google  60 percent for Microsoft and 47 percent for Yahoo The Reuters Ipsos poll was conducted online in English throughout the United States  It gathered responses from 2 237 people and has a credibility interval  a measure of accuracy  of 2 percentage points   Graphic  https   tmsnrt rs 2pA8DoG Facebook  the world s largest social media firm  has been offering apologies as it tries to repair its reputation among users  advertisers  lawmakers and investors for mistakes that let 50 million users  data get into the hands of political consultancy Cambridge Analytica   Graphic  Poll data   https   tmsnrt rs 2pFHBfN Facebook shares tumbled 14 percent last week  while the hashtag  DeleteFacebook gained traction online and the company s chief executive officer  Mark Zuckerberg  faced demands that he appear before U S  lawmakers to testify in a hearing Zuckerberg and Facebook s chief operating officer  Sheryl Sandberg  said last week that shoring up trust was their priority   We know this is an issue of trust  We know this is a critical moment for our company   Sandberg told CNBC on Thursday It is too early to say if distrust will cause people to step back from Facebook  eMarketer analyst Debra Williamson said  Customers of banks or other industries do not necessarily quit after losing faith  she said  It s psychologically harder to let go of a platform like Facebook that s become pretty well ingrained into people s lives   she said One reason that Facebook and other internet companies collect personal information from users is to deliver advertisements for products and services to people who are most likely to want them Facebook  with more than 2 billion monthly active users  made almost all its  40 6 billion in revenue last year from advertising The poll found that many people take a dim view of those  targeted  advertisements Some 63 percent said they would like to see  less targeted advertising  in the future  while 9 percent said they wanted more  When asked to compare them with traditional forms of advertising  41 percent said targeted ads are  worse  while 21 percent said they are  better   I think they make a lot of assumptions that are not true   poll respondent Maria Curran  56  who lives near Manchester  New Hampshire  said in a follow up interview  It s like if I show an interest in healthy eating  all of a sudden all of the ads are about weight control and exercise and how to lose weight  I just get inundated   she said Curran said she knows online retailer Amazon com also collects her information for targeted marketing  but that it is less annoying because it is a shopping site  not a place for personal conversations Another poll respondent  Kamaal Greene  26  said he likes targeted ads better than traditional ones because they provide a service  steering him to products he wants  A while ago I was looking for a special kind of glove for my job   said Greene  a firefighter from Detroit  I put it in my Amazon cart and forgot about it  Then  later  the ad popped up on     Facebook  and I was like  oh shoot   It reminded me and I clicked on it and bought it  A plurality of adults said they would like the government to take a bigger role in overseeing the industry s handling of user information  According to the poll  46 percent of adults said they want more government regulation  while 17 percent said they want less  Another 20 percent said they wanted no change  and the remaining 18 percent said they did not know  Reporting by Chris Kahn in New York and David Ingram in San Francisco  Editing by Leslie Adler 
WASHINGTON   House Intelligence Committee Republicans said Thursday that opposition to Donald J  Trump by the party s national security establishment had opened the door for two foreign policy advisers whose interactions with Russian intelligence prompted F B I  scrutiny The Republicans said they had found no evidence that either man  George Papadopoulos and Carter Page  had colluded with the Russians  despite the F B I  s interest in the men  Nor did campaign advisers and aides provide evidence that any member of the Trump campaign had colluded either  according to summaries of 44 findings and more than two dozen recommendations the committee voted to release Thursday  When asked directly  none of the interviewed witnesses provided evidence of collusion  coordination or conspiracy between the Trump campaign and the Russian government   one of the findings read First previewed last week  the findings are the culmination of a year old investigation by the committee  Democrats say the Republicans hurried the investigation  ignored crucial evidence and failed to follow obvious leads in an effort to clear Mr  Trump Other findings were less controversial and reflected the consensus position of American intelligence agencies and both parties on Capitol Hill  Representative K  Michael Conaway  Republican of Texas  who led the inquiry  said that the committee had found  a pattern of Russian active measures in the United States  both through cyberattacks and their use of social media to sow discord   This poses a serious threat to future U S  elections  including the primary elections that are already underway   he said in a statement   It s critical to release this information now to protect our country and our elections from foreign interference  In addition to releasing the summary findings  the committee voted to release a Republican written 250 page report over the objections of the committee s Democrats  who offered a series of unsuccessful last ditch motions to subpoena witnesses and documents  as well as to urge the House to hold Stephen K  Bannon  Mr  Trump s former adviser  in contempt  It was a fundamentally unserious effort   said Representative Adam B  Schiff of California  the top Democrat on the panel Democrats are drafting a dissenting report based on the committee s work thus far and have pledged to push on with their investigation without Republican cooperation  They have secured the cooperation of at least one new witness  Christopher Wylie  who helped found Cambridge Analytica and develop the company s voter profiling technology The Republican report chronicles Russia s increasingly brazen efforts in the run up to the 2016 election to compromise the United States  political institutions and fan existing divisions among voters  It concludes that the response by the Obama administration had been  insufficient  and said an October 2016 public statement calling out Russia proved  ineffective  The report takes issue with the  analytical tradecraft  used by intelligence agencies that concluded that President Vladimir V  Putin of Russia had wanted to harm the candidacy of Hillary Clinton and help Mr  Trump More divisive are the findings on collusion  That subject remains an area of inquiry by the Senate Intelligence Committee and the special counsel  Robert S  Mueller III  who took over the F B I  s investigation of the Trump campaign last year The House Republicans said that they had found repeated contacts between members of the Trump campaign team and Russians  but in each case  they concluded that there was no evidence of improper collaboration  Mr  Papadopoulos s attempts to connect the Trump campaign with the Russians had been  unsuccessful  Contacts with WikiLeaks were  ill advised   but did not show evidence that Trump associates were involved in the hacking or publication of Democratic emails  Republicans said  And though the Republicans said they were  concerned  about Mr  Page s  seemingly incomplete accounts  of a summer 2016 trip to Moscow  they noted that he had not been traveling on behalf of the campaign  Possible Russian efforts to set up a  back channel  with Trump associates after the election suggest the absence of collusion during the campaign  since the communication associated with collusion would have rendered such a  back channel  unnecessary   the Republicans wrote in another finding Many of the committee s recommendations center on the securing of the United States  voting systems and echo those presented by the Senate Intelligence Committee in recent days  including steps to improve communications of threats between states and the federal government and to ensure voting systems are not hacked Others could prove more controversial  For instance  the Republicans recommend that Congress consider repealing the Logan Act  a 1799 statute that bars private citizens from interfering with American diplomatic relations  The statute has never been successfully used in court but has been discussed in connection with contacts between Michael T  Flynn  Mr  Trump s first national security adviser  and the Russian ambassador at the time during the presidential transition They also recommend that the executive branch consider mandatory polygraph tests for political appointees with top secret security clearances who are not confirmed by the Senate 
 Good Friday  Here s what we re watching   Dropbox s valuation gives investors reason for caution   Dropbox rises 45 percent in its first day of trading   President Trump signs spending bill   GlaxoSmithKline withdrew its bid for Pfizer s consumer division   Bank of America Merrill Lynch paid  42 million to settle with N Y  s attorney general over trading practices   How bad will the U S  China trade fight be Get this in your inbox each morning  Sign up here Dropbox faces fierce competition  doesn t make a profit  its user growth has slowed  and outside shareholders have negligible voting power Yet for now  at least  investors think the company has an amazing future This optimism is reflected in the price of Dropbox s shares after they traded publicly for the first time on Friday  They leaped to  29 per share from  21  giving Dropbox  which charges businesses and individuals to store files on its computers  a market value of  12 7 billion  Putting that number in context reveals the bullishness of investors  Dropbox didn t have any profits in recent years  so comparisons have to be done using revenue and cash flows At  29  Dropbox is trading at 11 5 times last year s revenue of  1 1 billion  That is far higher than the 2 6 times sales for the companies in the Nasdaq index  according to Bloomberg data Of course  Dropbox s shares have benefited from demand for initial public offerings by technology companies  The stock might give back the gains  just as Snap s did after its I P O  last year Still  Dropbox s fans believe that the company has a strong financial future  despite competition from the likes of Google and Amazon  One of their main arguments is that the company can increase its revenue faster than its costs  a dynamic that should expand profit margins over time  Rishi N  Jaluria  an analyst at D A  Davidson  zeros in on its free cash flows  the amount of cash generated by a business after subtracting spending on plants and certain lease payments  to show this His measure of free cash flows was equivalent to 16 percent of revenue last year  but  in his estimation  that margin could rise to 19 percent this year  then 22 percent in 2019 After Friday s huge pop  Dropbox s stock has arguably  priced in  the impressive future cash flows that some analysts expect  Indeed  using Mr  Jaluria s forecasts  Dropbox s shares are already trading at a far higher cash flow valuation than that of Salesforce  a software and cloud computing company with a long track record What is more  Dropbox has areas of concern that should  in theory  give investors pause  The number of paid users grew 25 percent last year  slower than the 35 percent rate in 2016  Its average revenue per paying user edged up just 1 percent last year  Facebook s shares trade at the same multiple to sales as Dropbox s  Yet its revenue per user surged 26 percent last year   Peter EavisDropbox finished at  28 48  up 36 percent from its initial public offering price The file storage company on Thursday sold 36 million shares at  21 apiece  That was above its expected range of  18 to  20 a share and valued the company  9 2 billion At Friday s close  Dropbox is valued at  12 5 billionHere are some more numbers to put the I P O  market into perspective   So far this year  38 companies have listed shares on American exchanges  raising  12 8 billion  That s up 13 percent from a year ago and the most year to date since 2011  according to Thomson Reuters   The shares of companies that have debuted on American exchanges this year are up  on average  15    The average gain for tech I P O  this year is 43    Since the start of 2017  shares of tech companies that have gone public are up 72 percent The three best performing I P O s in 2018  Armo Biosciences   126 percent   CueBiopharma   120 percent   Menlo Therapeutics   102 percent The three worst performing I P O s in 2018  ADT   38 percent   Corporacion America Airports   39 percent   Solid Biosciences LLC   48 percent The closer investors look at President Trump s tariffs against China  the less they seem to like them This can be seen in the way the stock market has responded to the trade restrictions  which were announced on Thursday but were flagged a few days earlier  The S  P  500 index was down 5 95 percent this week  falling every day but one  And the selling at the end of the week looked like like it was turning into a rout  with the S  P  500 skidding 2 52 percent on Thursday and 2 1 percent on Friday We know that Mr  Trump watches the stock market s response to his policies  He was reassured when the stock market rose after he announced tariffs on imported steel and aluminum  Will this week s nosedive unsettle him to the point he softens his stance on trade with China  Mr  Trump sounded unfazed on Friday   I think the stock market is going to be great   he said   Peter EavisThe president abruptly backed down from his threat to veto the  1 3 trillion spending bill and signed it into law on Friday  avoiding a government shutdown Early in the day  the president had tweeted his displeasure with the bill  citing Congress s failure to fund his long promised border wall From this morning Julie Hirschfeld and Michael D  Shear of the NYT  The backstory to the bill  Here s how Congressional leaders settled lawmakers  objections  As Facebook plunged into a crisis over how Cambridge Analytica  a political consulting firm that provided voter targeting services to the Trump campaign  improperly obtained data on 50 million Facebook users  Mark Zuckerberg came under criticism for saying nothing  Finally  on Wednesday he released a statement and sat down for interviews  We asked Paul Pendergrass  a long time corporate communication professional and formerly DealBook s  Jack Flack  columnist  to offer his insights into the situation  In most of the interviews on Wednesday  Mark Zuckerberg was asked if he would be willing to testify before Congress  a task he has previously delegated to other senior Facebook executives  I d be happy to   he told CNN s Laurie Segall  before immediately qualifying that answer with   if it s the right thing to do  He then went on to offer Facebook s standard response to questions about why it has previously chosen other executives for Congressional hearings He elaborated Mr  Zuckerberg was surely being coy  When Congress requests the presence of a C E O  embroiled in a high profile controversy  they re usually not looking for information  They want a pelt to hang on the wall  and celebrity chief executives are particularly attractive So it s definitely a media opportunity  but for members of Congress  not the C E O If Mr  Zuckerberg wants proof of that  he can ask John Stumpf  the former C E O  of Wells Fargo  and the bank s current chief executive  Tim Sloan  how much information they were asked to provide  He could ask the same of the C E O  of United Airlines  Oscar Munoz  about his trip to Capitol Hill just after a passenger was dragged off one of his airplanes  For that matter  Mr  Zuckerberg could walk down the hallway and ask Facebook s general counsel  Colin Stretch  Just last fall Mr  Stretch endured a Senate lashing over the use of Facebook by Russian operatives When Mr  Zuckerberg is brought in to testify  the committee s  goal  will be to ensure the American public understands why social media platforms can t be trusted to regulate themselves  Mr  Zuckerberg s goal will be to try to avoid acting in a way that would elevate his role as the designated villain in the story Mr  Zuckerberg seems resigned to the fact that he will likely end up testifying   I would imagine at some time there will be a topic where I will be the sole authority on  and it will make sense for me to do it   he told Ms  Segall After this past week  he will have little leeway to refuse  Having been roundly accused of hiding in the crucial early days of the Cambridge Analytica scandal  he won t want to provide further evidence that he is inaccessible when people need to see him most Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg have clashed on artificial intelligence  space travel and the direction of technology On Friday  Mr  Musk showed just how little love lost there was between the two tech titans Mr  Musk  the chief executive of SpaceX and Tesla  deleted the Facebook pages of both of his companies  the NYT s Nellie Bowles reports Mr  Musk growing chorus of tech leaders calling for people to abandon Mr  Zuckerberg s social network after it allowed a political consulting firm  Cambridge Analytica  to obtain and misuse data on 50 million users China s state backed funds have a history of stepping in to smooth out swings in the country s stock market  And so on Friday as China stocks tumbled amid fears of a trade war with the United States  those funds began buying  Bloomberg reports  citing unnamed sources They purchased large cap stocks  including Sinopec and China Life Insurance Co   Bloomberg reports Shares of both those companies erased losses late in the trading session  and the large cap CSI 300 Index finished down 2 9 percent after falling as much as 4 6 percent   Stephen GrocerShares in both retailers are up in premarket trading this morning after Fast Company reported that the two sides are weighing a union  Shares in Kroger were up 4 percent  while those in Target were up over 2 percent The purported rationale  the usual one  Retailers are under pressure from Amazon and need to get bigger both in brick and mortar stores and online But Fast Company cautioned   The companies appear to be struggling to decide whether a merger is the best path forward   And Courtney Reagan of CNBC  citing an unnamed source  threw

As questions mounted last year about whether Facebook had been exploited to tilt the U S  presidential election  Mark Zuckerberg landed on a fishing trawler off Alabama s Gulf coast But the chatter surrounding the CEO s arrival in port was that it signaled something bigger than just the start of a 30 state personal tour  his designs on a job even more powerful than leading the social network that links 2 2 billion people worldwide  I asked him if he was interested in running for president of the United States   said Dominick Ficarino  who owns a shrimp business in Bayou La Batre  Alabama  and hosted Zuckerberg that afternoon   And his answer to me was   Can I answer you with a question  If you were me  would you   Thirteen months later  Zuckerberg no longer has the luxury of mulling a hypothetical next act  Instead  he is grappling with a crisis that has enveloped the company synonymous with his face and name  It does not help that the most glaring reminder of Facebook s flaws is the unabated uproar over the American presidency itself  The world feels anxious and divided  and Facebook has a lot of work to do   Zuckerberg wrote in January  laying out his annual  personal challenge  In 2017  the billionaire sought to travel to every state he d never visited  This year  Zuckerberg said his personal goal is to  fix  Facebook Yet things continue to get worse  Scrutiny of Facebook has intensified following reports that it failed to prevent the data mining firm Cambridge Analytica from amassing personal information about millions of users   possibly used to aid Donald Trump s campaign   and that the social network has been collecting Android users  phone call and text message histories without notice  That adds to criticism that Facebook manipulates its users and has allowed Russian bots to divide Americans by spreading false information On Monday  the Federal Trade Commission announced it was investigating Facebook for its privacy practices Zuckerberg preaches transparency  but flinches at questioning  He is undeniably brilliant  but stubborn about acknowledging the extent of Facebook s problems Is he prepared to do all it will take the right the ship  If he fails to do it  it may take a while but eventually people are going to rebel   said Roger McNamee  an early Facebook investor and adviser who has become a pointed critic  I thought Facebook was a force for good in the world for a really long time   McNamee said   I think it s really hard to make that case today  Days after Trump s election  Zuckerberg was pressed on the possibility that foreign agents had used his social network to divide voters  The idea that fake news on Facebook     influenced the election in any way  I think  is a pretty crazy idea   the CEO said at a technology conference  I think all of us were shocked to learn how wrong he was   said David Kirkpatrick  the author of a 2010 book about Facebook who questioned Zuckerberg that day Zuckerberg walked back the remark soon after  continuing a years long routine of self correction  But errors that reflect his stubbornness  those who know him say  are tempered by an eagerness to learn and a deep sense of reflection Naomi Gleit  Facebook s longest serving employee after the CEO  said Zuckerberg   who declined an interview request from The Associated Press   has talked about making the world a better place since he was 21  But his view of his place in that world seemed like  a burden of responsibility   she said With Zuckerberg   its experiment  learn  experiment  learn   said LinkedIn co founder Reid Hoffman  who has known him since 2004 But in the process of learning  Zuckerberg s inexperience has sometimes played out in public view  such as when he donated  100 million to Newark  New Jersey  schools in 2010 with few specifics outlining how the money should be spent  He was just a very young  naive  inexperienced guy who was brilliant     but just really didn t know much about how the world worked   said Dale Russakoff  author of  The Prize   a book chronicling the Newark experiment Zuckerberg and his wife  Priscilla Chan  have since chartered their own foundation to take on mammoth goals  like a  3 billion investment to cure  prevent or manage all diseases To free up his fortune for philanthropy  Zuckerberg last year pushed board members to restructure Facebook s stock  allowing him to sell off part of his stake while maintaining control  That prompted a suit by a group of shareholders who argued that the move would benefit only Zuckerberg while diluting the value of other investors  stakes  The company dropped the plan The gambit hints at the complexity of being Zuckerberg  who advocates for transparency and community but whose individual interests don t always align Zuckerberg  who has 105 million Facebook  friends   is compelled to share far more about himself than would be expected of another CEO  Yet he fiercely guards his privacy  Intellectually  he believes in transparency   Kirkpatrick said   But emotionally  it s very difficult for him  Shortly before the 2016 election  McNamee sent a letter to Zuckerberg and Facebook s chief operating officer  Sheryl Sandberg  warning the company was being manipulated in ways its creators never intended  It wasn t just about the U S  election  A consulting firm had collected data on people interested in the Black Lives Matter movement and sold it to police departments  and critics had detected a well organized  clandestine campaign supporting Brexit McNamee said he has been disappointed in the incremental changes announced since  but Zuckerberg s supporters say he is unfairly blamed Hoffman  the LinkedIn co founder  credits him with leading Facebook through a shift in mindset  nudging users into a more positive virtual environment   without completely shutting out inflammatory content Kirkpatrick argues  though  that Zuckerberg still must deal with existential threats to Facebook s business   its potential to negatively affect democracy and the way it hooks in users  I do not think he has yet grasped the gravity with which his service is being perceived to be a socially harmful force all around the world  And I also don t think he realizes the extent to which that really is true  McNamee  recalling Zuckerberg as a 22 year old visionary  said the CEO must be willing to rethink long held assumptions  But that does not mean he has to abandon building his global community  You ve achieved more than your wildest dreams   McNamee said he would tell Zuckerberg if asked again for his counsel   You re a billionaire  Now you have a chance to be a hero
