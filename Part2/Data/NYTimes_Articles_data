        LONDON/SAN FRANCISCO —  The suspended chief executive of Cambridge Analytica said in a secretly recorded video broadcast on Tuesday that his UK-based political consultancy's online campaign played a decisive role in U.S. President Donald Trump's 2016 election victory.CEO Alexander Nix's comments, which could not be verified, are potentially a further problem for Facebook Inc as it faces lawmakers' scrutiny in the United States and Europe over Cambridge Analytica's improper use of 50 million Facebook users' personal data to target voters.The social media network's shares fell for a second day, closing down 2.5 percent, as investors worried that its dealings with Cambridge Analytica might damage its reputation, deter advertisers and invite restrictive regulation. The company has lost $60 billion of its stock market value over the last two days.Cambridge Analytica's board of directors suspended Nix on Tuesday, shortly before the second part of British broadcaster Channel 4's expose of the firm's methods.

        Nix’s comments ""do not represent the values or operations of the firm and his suspension reflects the seriousness with which we view this violation,"" Cambridge Analytica said in a statement on Tuesday.Cambridge Analytica has denied all the media claims and said it deleted the data after learning the information did not adhere to data protection rules.Brad Parscale, the 2016 Trump campaign’s main digital adviser who dealt regularly with Cambridge Analytica, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Nix's claims.Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law and now senior adviser, oversaw the Trump campaign's digital operations. One former Trump adviser said Kushner brought Cambridge Analytica into the 2016 campaign effort. Kushner's lawyer did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Cambridge Analytica whistleblower Christopher Wylie told the Washington Post on Tuesday that in 2014 conservative strategist Steve Bannon, who would go on to be Trump's White House adviser, oversaw the firm's early efforts to collect Facebook data to build detailed profiles on millions of American voters. (http://wapo.st/2HOTQNu)Bannon approved spending nearly $1 million to acquire data, including Facebook profiles, in 2014, Wylie told the Post. It is unclear whether Bannon knew how Cambridge Analytica was obtaining the Facebook data, the Post reported.Bannon, who served on Cambridge Analytica's board, did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Reuters.

U.S. law bans foreigners from making contributions or spending money on behalf of a U.S. election campaign but it was not illegal for the Trump campaign to retain Cambridge Analytica's services, according to Bradley Smith, a former Republican member of the U.S. Federal Election Commission.""The fact that they are a British company doesn’t add anything to the analysis unless they were giving their services away for free or charging below-market rates,” said Smith, now a professor at the Capital University Law School in Columbus, Ohio.FTC REVIEW, LAWSUITU.S. and European lawmakers have demanded an explanation of how Cambridge Analytica gained access to user data in 2014 and why Facebook failed to inform its users, raising broader industry questions about consumer privacy.Facebook said it had been told by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the leading U.S. consumer regulator, that it would receive a letter this week with questions about the data acquired by Cambridge Analytica. It said it had no indication of a formal investigation.""The entire company is outraged we were deceived,"" Facebook said in a statement on Tuesday. ""We are committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information and will take whatever steps are required to see that this happens.”

The FTC is reviewing whether Facebook violated a 2011 consent decree it reached with the authority over its privacy practices, a person briefed on the matter told Reuters.If the FTC finds Facebook violated terms of the consent decree, it has the power to fine the company thousands of dollars a day per violation, which could add up to billions of dollars.Facebook was also hit on Tuesday in a San Francisco court by the first of what could be many lawsuits by shareholders claiming to suffer losses because the company misled them about its ability to protect user data. The company could also soon face lawsuits on behalf of users whose personal information was exposed.Facebook and its peers Alphabet Inc's Google and   Twitter already face a backlash from users and lawmakers over their role during the U.S. presidential election by allowing the spread of false information that might have swayed voters toward Trump.

Fear of increased regulation hurt other social media firms on Tuesday. Shares of Snap Inc fell 2.5 percent and Twitter Inc fell more than 10 percent.FOREIGN INFLUENCEU.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, called on Tuesday for Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to testify in Congress. Congressional staff said the company would brief U.S. Senate and House aides on Wednesday.A Congressional official said House Intelligence Committee Democrats plan to interview Cambridge Analytica whistleblower Wylie. The committee interviewed Nix by video teleconference, according to the Congressional official, but a transcript of that interview has not yet been made public.The Senate Intelligence Committee, which is conducting a long-term investigation of alleged Russian interference in U.S. politics and a detailed examination of U.S. election security precautions, would carry out its own inquiry of Cambridge Analytica, a Congressional official with direct knowledge of the investigation said.The White House said it welcomed inquiries, and that the president believes that Americans' privacy should be protected.PERSONAL INFORMATIONIn Britain, the Information Commissioner's Office, an independent authority set up to uphold information rights in the public interest, was seeking a warrant from a judge to search the offices of London-based Cambridge Analytica. It was unclear late on Tuesday whether it had obtained it.Created in 2013, Cambridge Analytica markets itself as a source of consumer research, targeted advertising and other data-related services to both political and corporate clients.According to the New York Times, it was launched with $15 million in backing from billionaire Republican donor Robert Mercer and a name chosen by Bannon.

Facebook says the data were harvested by a British academic, Aleksandr Kogan, who created an app on the platform that was downloaded by 270,000 people, providing access not only to their own personal data but also data from their friends.Facebook said Kogan then violated its policies by passing the data to Cambridge Analytica. Facebook has since suspended both the consulting firm and SCL (Strategic Communication Laboratories), a government and military contractor.Facebook said it had been told that the data were destroyed. Kogan was not immediately reachable for comment.(Reporting by David Ingram in San Francisco, Kate Holton and Paul Sandle in London, David Shepardson, Susan Heavey, Mark Hosenball, Jonathan Landay and Sarah N.

        SAN FRANCISCO —  British data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica is at the center of controversy in the United States and Britain after two newspapers reported on Sunday that the company harvested personal data about Facebook users beginning in 2014.Best known for assisting the 2016 presidential campaign of U.S. President Donald Trump, Cambridge Analytica is now facing a government search of its London office, questions from U.S. state authorities, and a demand by Facebook that it submit to a forensic audit.Here is some of what is known about the company.How did it start?Cambridge Analytica is an offshoot of SCL Group, a government and military contractor that says it works on everything from food security research to counter-narcotics to political campaigns. SCL was founded more than 25 years ago, according to its website.Cambridge Analytica was created around 2013 initially with a focus on U.S. elections, with $15 million in backing from billionaire Republican donor Robert Mercer and a name chosen by future Trump White House adviser Steve Bannon, the New York Times reported.

The company, which the New York Times reported was staffed by mostly British workers then, assisted Republican Senator Ted Cruz's presidential campaign before helping Trump's.        Continue reading the main story

        What do they do?Cambridge Analytica markets itself as providing consumer research, targeted advertising and other data-related services to both political and corporate clients.It does not list its corporate clients but on its website describes them as including a daily newspaper that wanted to know more about its subscribers, a women's clothing brand that sought research on its customers and a U.S. auto insurer interested in marketing itself.Britain's Channel 4 News reported on Monday, based on secretly recorded video, that Cambridge Analytica secretly stage-managed Kenya President Uhuru Kenyatta's campaigns in the hotly contested 2013 and 2017 elections. Cambridge Analytica denied the report.The company's website lists five office locations in New York, Washington, London, Brazil and Malaysia.When did it first get attention?After Trump won the White House in 2016, in part with the firm's help, Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix went to more clients to pitch his services, the Times reported last year. The company boasted it could develop psychological profiles of consumers and voters which was a ""secret sauce"" it used to sway them more effectively than traditional advertising could.Rival consultants and campaign aides, though, expressed doubts about the company's claims. Brad Parscale, who ran Trump's digital operations in 2016, said the campaign did not use Cambridge Analytica's data, relying instead on voter data from a Republican National Committee operation.

What is it accused of?Cambridge Analytica beginning in 2014 obtained data on 50 million Facebook users via means that deceived both the users and Facebook, the New York Times and London's Observer reported on Saturday.The data was harvested by an application developed by a British academic, Aleksandr Kogan, the newspapers said. Some 270,000 people downloaded the application and logged in with their Facebook credentials, according to Facebook. The application gathered their data and data about their friends, and then Kogan passed the data to Cambridge Analytica, according to both Cambridge Analytica and Facebook.

Cambridge Analytica said on Saturday that it did not initially know Kogan violated Facebook's terms, and that it deleted the data once it found out in 2015. Kogan could not be reached for comment.The data, though, was not deleted, the two newspapers reported on Saturday. Cambridge Analytica said that the allegation was not true. Facebook said it was investigating to verify the accuracy of the claim.What happens next?Facebook said it was pressing Cambridge Analytica for answers, after getting assurances from the firm in 2015 that it had deleted all data. Facebook has hired forensic auditors from the firm Stroz Friedberg to help.While Facebook investigates, the social network said it was suspending Cambridge Analytica, its parent SCL, Kogan and another man, Christopher Wylie, formerly of Cambridge Analytica, from its platform for violating Facebook rules.Facebook's probe, though, may have to wait until government authorities complete their investigation. The UK Information Commissioner's Office is pursuing a warrant to search Cambridge Analytica's office and asked Facebook's auditors to stand down in the meantime, according to Facebook.Attorneys general from the U.S. states of Massachusetts and Connecticut have launched investigations into how the Facebook data was handled, and the attorney general's office in California, where Facebook is based, said it had concerns.(Reporting by David Ingram)        Continue reading the main story

        LONDON —  British consultancy firm Cambridge Analytica lies at the centre of a storm for using data obtained from millions of Facebook users without their permission after it was hired by Donald Trump for his 2016 U.S. presidential election campaign.However, the analytics firm is also under scrutiny over campaigning for the 2016 referendum when Britons voted to leave the European Union.Cambridge Analytica and the leaders of the Leave.EU group have previously boasted about working together during the Brexit campaign. However, they have since retracted their claims, saying no contract was signed and no work was completed.Parliament is investigating the links between Cambridge Analytica and Leave.EU as part of an investigation into fake news.

Did Cambridge Analytica and Leave.EU work together?Arron Banks, the co-founder of Leave.EU, said in a book that in October 2015 his group hired Cambridge Analytica, a company that uses ""big data and advanced psychographics"" to influence people. In a November 2015, Leave.EU said on its website that Cambridge Analytica ""will be helping us map the British electorate and what they believe in, enabling us to better engage with voters"".

        In the same month, Cambridge Analytica director Brittany Kaiser spoke at a Leave.EU news conference. She said her organisation would be ""running large-scale research of the nation to really understand why people are interested in staying in or out of the EU"".In February 2016, Cambridge Analytica chief executive  Alexander Nix wrote in Campaign magazine that his company was working for Leave.EU. ""We have already helped supercharge Leave.EU's social media campaign by ensuring the right messages are getting to the right voters online,"" said Nix, who was suspended by the company this week.Leave.EU's communications director Andy Wigmore also said on Twitter last year that his campaign group had used the company. ""You should use Cambridge Analytics,"" he said, adding that he could ""highly recommend them"".What does Leave.EU say now?Banks says Cambridge Analytica sought work with the Leave.EU before the referendum but that ultimately it never did any - paid or otherwise - for the campaign.

""We did have dealings with Cambridge Analytica – they put forward a pitch that went into the designation document submitted to the electoral commission,"" Banks told Reuters.No work was done with Cambridge Analytica because Leave.EU did not win the designation as the official leave campaign and due to concerns about the consultancy, Banks said.When asked if Leave.EU paid or accepted any services from Cambridge Analytica, Banks said: ""No benefit in kind, no data, no nothing.""Banks told a parliamentary committee earlier this month that when he referred to Cambridge Analytica being ""hired"" in his book this was a reference to the intention to work them.

What does Cambridge Analytica say now?Nix told a parliamentary committee last month that he contacted Banks and Wigmore and their statements were not true.The article written in the Campaign magazine was a mistake and ""drafted by a slightly overzealous PR consultant"", he said.This ""referenced work that we hoped and intended to undertake for the campaign. Subsequently, work was never undertaken. The moment that that statement went out we were absolutely crystal clear to all the media outlets that we were not involved and that it had been released in error,"" he said.(Reporting by Andrew MacAskill; editing by David Stamp)        Continue reading the main story

        LONDON —  A former Cambridge Analytica political consultant said the company's management misled the British public about work the firm did for a pro-Brexit group before the vote to leave the European Union, the Guardian reported on Friday.Brittany Kaiser, a business development director at the company from 2014 until earlier this year, said in an interview that Cambridge Analytica was carrying out data crunching and analysis work for Leave.EU, while publicly denying it was doing so.The insider account puts further pressure on the London-based data analytics firm, which is already facing renewed scrutiny in the United States and Europe over allegations it improperly harvested Facebook data to target U.S. voters.Late on Friday, a High Court judge granted an application by the UK Information Commissioner's Office for a warrant to search Cambridge Analytica's offices.

I do not know how many ways I can say this. We did not work for Leave.EU. We have not undertaken any paid or unpaid work for them, okay?"" he told a committee investigating fake news in UK politics.Cambridge Analytica's board of directors suspended Nix on Tuesday shortly before British broadcaster Channel 4 aired an expose of the firm's business practices in the United States.Arron Banks, a major donor to Leave.EU, wrote in ""The Bad Boys of Brexit"" a campaign diary he published after the campaign that the group had hired Cambridge Analytica on Oct. 22, 2015 to use 'big data and advanced psychographics to influence people'.(Reporting by Eric Auchard in London; Editing by Adrian Croft)        Continue reading the main story

        LONDON —  The suspended chief executive of UK-based political consultancy Cambridge Analytica claimed in secretly recorded video that his company played a decisive role in the 2016 election campaign of President Donald Trump, Channel 4 News reported on Tuesday.British broadcaster Channel 4 News mounted a ""sting operation"" in which it secretly recorded Cambridge Analytica Chief Executive Alexander Nix saying he had met the then Republican presidential candidate ""many times"" and that his firm played a central role in the final months of the campaign.""We did all the research. We did all the data. We did all the analytics. We did all the targeting. We ran all the digital campaign and our data informed their strategy,"" Nix told an undercover reporter during a meeting in a London hotel.Brad Parscale, the 2016 Trump campaign’s main digital adviser who dealt regularly with Cambridge Analytica, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Parscale was recently named manager of Trump’s 2020 re-election campaign.

        The London-based company's statement said: ""In the view of the board, Mr. Nix’s recent comments secretly recorded by Channel 4 and other allegations do not represent the values or operations of the firm and his suspension reflects the seriousness with which we view this violation.""Nix also was recorded by Channel 4 saying that Cambridge Analytica did not have to reveal to U.S. investigators anything about the company's foreign political campaign clients. If asked, he said he would respond: ""We say 'none of your business'.""

    Why Leaving Facebook Doesn’t Always Mean Quitting

        
            
                In the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, in which data from over 50 million Facebook profiles was secretly scraped and mined for voter insights, many Facebook users have decided to delete their accounts — but untangling yourself from a site like Facebook is not as easy as pressing “delete.”

    Debates over privacy have plagued Facebook for years.But the news that  Cambridge Analytica, a political data firm that worked on President Trump’s 2016 campaign, was able to gain access to private data through the social network has sparked an unusually strong reaction among its users.The hashtag #DeleteFacebook appeared more than 10,000 times on Twitter within a two-hour period on Wednesday, according to the analytics service ExportTweet. On Tuesday, it was mentioned 40,398 times, according to the analytics service Digimind.Cher was one such deserter, writing on Twitter that the decision to quit Facebook, although “very hard,” was necessary because she loves the United States.

    For people who aren’t celebrities or billionaires, the decision to abandon Facebook came reluctantly, because the platform often served as their sole connection to certain relatives, friends and professional opportunities.

        For a long time now, Mr. Perry had wanted to leave Facebook.He never felt comfortable knowing that the company had access to much of his personal information. In the months before the 2016 presidential election, he watched the social network become what he called “a garbage platform of ads and weird reposted articles and people that you care about exposing themselves as racists.”But Facebook was also where Mr. Perry promoted his films, where he posted ads seeking help on the set, and where he communicated with colleagues and a “massive number” of his friends and relatives.Until he heard about Cambridge Analytica.“I suspected this stuff was going on, but this is the first time it’s been plainly exposed,” he said. “It seems so malicious, and Facebook seems so complicit all the way up and down, like it doesn’t care about its users.”Mr. Perry, 39, has since deleted his profile and plans to switch to Twitter and Instagram for his social media needs.“It was an easy decision,” he said. “It’s not going to be the end of the world.”______Dan ClarkA retired Navy veteran in MaineMr. Clark kept one Facebook account to chat with friends and a separate account to keep tabs on members of his family nationwide. This week, he deleted both.“Facebook was the main platform I used to keep in touch with all of them, and it was a difficult decision to give it up,” he said. “But you have to stand for something, so I just put my foot down and said enough is enough.”

Mr. Clark, 57, said he had already been angry with Facebook for censoring some of his posts, which he said expressed his staunchly conservative views but were “never evil or putting anybody down.” He could not abide the idea that his personal information was also being sold or given away without his consent.Before cutting the cord, Mr. Clark posted on Facebook inviting his contacts to ask him for his personal phone number. More than 100 people reached out within three days.“There are just so many ways nowadays to stay in contact: phones, email, instant message, Gab, which is a social network that doesn’t censor anything,” he said. “Facebook is more obsolete than people would think.”______Photo

The Cambridge Analytica scandal led her to remove the Facebook app from her phone. “I’m not going to give them my engagement clicks,” Ms. Kleeman, 32, said. But she is keeping the messaging function open for professional purposes and will continue using Instagram.She doesn’t mind the idea that some personal data can be made public — she used to have a blog, she said.“But the idea that my data could be used for purposes that I expressly don’t want, that freaks me out.”______Paul MusgraveAn assistant professor in Amherst, Mass.Twitter makes Mr. Musgrave feel depressed about the world, but Facebook is the social media platform he is trying to abandon.

As a political science teacher at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, Mr. Musgrave, 36, feels a professional responsibility to keep abreast of the news and academic chatter hurtling at him in the form of tweets.Facebook was more valuable to him as a “low-key, offstage networking tool,” a “replacement for end-of-year family newsletters” that allowed him to “passively keep up with people,” he said. He joined the platform more than a decade ago and before that had been a member of Friendster, a precursor to Facebook.But in 2016, while helping his mother during her campaign for a government position in Indiana, Mr. Musgrave discovered a “poisonous swamp” of content on the site. The Cambridge Analytica findings were even more disturbing, he said.""This is a company that has Orwellian levels of data about us, truly Big Brother-level, but it’s behaving as if it has no social responsibility and is a purely neutral medium of communication,” he said. ""That’s what’s really been scary.”Having deactivated his Facebook account, with plans to delete it, he now worries about connecting with people who use the social network as their main conduit of communication.“I’m definitely pruning myself away from some of those really important branches,” he said. “I watch my own students try to navigate the world of apps and smartphones, and even they don’t really know how the internet works outside these enclosed garden spaces.”______Photo

A year ago, Mr. Greenzweig was an “extraordinarily active” Facebook user who juggled conversations with friends, managed several groups, took out ads for his business and maintained professional contacts.But on Tuesday night, in his final post, he asked his network to connect with him through email, LinkedIn, Twitter or phone.“See everyone in the real world,” he wrote.

        (After this story was published, Facebook came under harsh criticism from lawmakers in the United States and Britain. Read the latest.)LONDON — As the upstart voter-profiling company Cambridge Analytica prepared to wade into the 2014 American midterm elections, it had a problem.The firm had secured a $15 million investment from Robert Mercer, the wealthy Republican donor, and wooed his political adviser, Stephen K. Bannon, with the promise of tools that could identify the personalities of American voters and influence their behavior. But it did not have the data to make its new products work.So the firm harvested private information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users without their permission, according to former Cambridge employees, associates and documents, making it one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history. The breach allowed the company to exploit the private social media activity of a huge swath of the American electorate, developing techniques that underpinned its work on President Trump’s campaign in 2016.

        “They want to fight a culture war in America,” he added. “Cambridge Analytica was supposed to be the arsenal of weapons to fight that culture war.”Details of Cambridge’s acquisition and use of Facebook data have surfaced in several accounts since the business began working on the 2016 campaign, setting off a furious debate about the merits of the firm’s so-called psychographic modeling techniques.But the full scale of the data leak involving Americans has not been previously disclosed — and Facebook, until now, has not acknowledged it. Interviews with a half-dozen former employees and contractors, and a review of the firm’s emails and documents, have revealed that Cambridge not only relied on the private Facebook data but still possesses most or all of the trove.Cambridge paid to acquire the personal information through an outside researcher who, Facebook says, claimed to be collecting it for academic purposes.During a week of inquiries from The Times, Facebook downplayed the scope of the leak and questioned whether any of the data still remained out of its control. But on Friday, the company posted a statement expressing alarm and promising to take action.“This was a scam — and a fraud,” Paul Grewal, a vice president and deputy general counsel at the social network, said in a statement to The Times earlier on Friday. He added that the company was suspending Cambridge Analytica, Mr. Wylie and the researcher, Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, from Facebook. “We will take whatever steps are required to see that the data in question is deleted once and for all — and take action against all offending parties,” Mr. Grewal said.

Alexander Nix, the chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, and other officials had repeatedly denied obtaining or using Facebook data, most recently during a parliamentary hearing last month. But in a statement to The Times, the company acknowledged that it had acquired the data, though it blamed Mr. Kogan for violating Facebook’s rules and said it had deleted the information as soon as it learned of the problem two years ago.In Britain, Cambridge Analytica is facing intertwined investigations by Parliament and government regulators into allegations that it performed illegal work on the “Brexit” campaign. The country has strict privacy laws, and its information commissioner announced on Saturday that she was looking into whether the Facebook data was “illegally acquired and used.”In the United States, Mr. Mercer’s daughter, Rebekah, a board member, Mr. Bannon and Mr. Nix received warnings from their lawyer that it was illegal to employ foreigners in political campaigns, according to company documents and former employees.Photo

            Congressional investigators have questioned Mr. Nix about the company’s role in the Trump campaign. And the Justice Department’s special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, has  demanded the emails of Cambridge Analytica employees who worked for the Trump team as part of his investigation into Russian interference in the election.While the substance of Mr. Mueller’s interest is a closely guarded secret, documents viewed by The Times indicate that the firm’s British affiliate claims to have worked in Russia and Ukraine. And the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, disclosed in October that Mr. Nix had reached out to him during the campaign in hopes of obtaining private emails belonging to Mr. Trump’s Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton.The documents also raise new questions about Facebook, which is already grappling with intense criticism over the spread of Russian propaganda and fake news. The data Cambridge collected from profiles, a portion of which was viewed by The Times, included details on users’ identities, friend networks and “likes.” Only a tiny fraction of the users had agreed to release their information to a third party.“Protecting people’s information is at the heart of everything we do,” Mr. Grewal said. “No systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.”Still, he added, “it’s a serious abuse of our rules.”Reading Voters’ MindsThe Bordeaux flowed freely as Mr. Nix and several colleagues sat down for dinner at the Palace Hotel in Manhattan in late 2013, Mr. Wylie recalled in an interview. They had much to celebrate.

Mr. Nix, a brash salesman, led the small elections division at SCL Group, a political and defense contractor. He had spent much of the year trying to break into the lucrative new world of political data, recruiting Mr. Wylie, then a 24-year-old political operative with ties to veterans of President Obama’s campaigns. Mr. Wylie was interested in using inherent psychological traits to affect voters’ behavior and had assembled a team of psychologists and data scientists, some of them affiliated with Cambridge University.The group experimented abroad, including in the Caribbean and Africa, where privacy rules were lax or nonexistent and politicians employing SCL were happy to provide government-held data, former employees said.Then a chance meeting brought Mr. Nix into contact with Mr. Bannon, the Breitbart News firebrand who would later become a Trump campaign and White House adviser, and with Mr. Mercer, one of the richest men on earth.

Mr. Nix and his colleagues courted Mr. Mercer, who believed a sophisticated data company could make him a kingmaker in Republican politics, and his daughter Rebekah, who shared his conservative views. Mr. Bannon was intrigued by the possibility of using personality profiling to shift America’s culture and rewire its politics, recalled Mr. Wylie and other former employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had signed nondisclosure agreements. Mr. Bannon and the Mercers declined to comment.Mr. Mercer agreed to help finance a $1.5 million pilot project to poll voters and test psychographic messaging in Virginia’s gubernatorial race in November 2013, where the Republican attorney general, Ken Cuccinelli, ran against Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic fund-raiser. Though Mr. Cuccinelli lost, Mr. Mercer committed to moving forward.The Mercers wanted results quickly, and more business beckoned. In early 2014, the investor Toby Neugebauer and other wealthy conservatives were preparing to put tens of millions of dollars behind a presidential campaign for Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, work that Mr. Nix was eager to win.When Mr. Wylie’s colleagues failed to produce a memo explaining their work to Mr. Neugebauer, Mr. Nix castigated them over email.“ITS 2 PAGES!! 4 hours work max (or an hour each). What have you all been doing??” he wrote.Mr. Wylie’s team had a bigger problem. Building psychographic profiles on a national scale required data the company could not gather without huge expense. Traditional analytics firms used voting records and consumer purchase histories to try to predict political beliefs and voting behavior.

But those kinds of records were useless for figuring out whether a particular voter was, say, a neurotic introvert, a religious extrovert, a fair-minded liberal or a fan of the occult. Those were among the psychological traits the firm claimed would provide a uniquely powerful means of designing political messages.Photo
    
            
        Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, built an app that helped the firm harvest Facebook data.
                    Mr. Wylie found a solution at Cambridge University’s Psychometrics Centre. Researchers there had developed a technique to map personality traits based on what people had liked on Facebook. The researchers paid users small sums to take a personality quiz and download an app, which would scrape some private information from their profiles and those of their friends, activity that Facebook permitted at the time. The approach, the scientists said, could reveal more about a person than their parents or romantic partners knew — a claim that has been disputed.

When the Psychometrics Centre declined to work with the firm, Mr. Wylie found someone who would: Dr. Kogan, who was then a psychology professor at the university and knew of the techniques. Dr. Kogan built his own app and in June 2014 began harvesting data for Cambridge Analytica. The business covered the costs — more than $800,000 — and allowed him to keep a copy for his own research, according to company emails and financial records.All he divulged to Facebook, and to users in fine print, was that he was collecting information for academic purposes, the social network said. It did not verify his claim. Dr. Kogan declined to provide details of what happened, citing nondisclosure agreements with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, though he maintained that his program was “a very standard vanilla Facebook app.”He ultimately provided over 50 million raw profiles to the firm, Mr. Wylie said, a number confirmed by a company email and a former colleague. Of those, roughly 30 million — a number previously reported by The Intercept — contained enough information, including places of residence, that the company could match users to other records and build psychographic profiles. Only about 270,000 users — those who participated in the survey — had consented to having their data harvested.Photo
    
            
        An email from Dr. Kogan to Mr. Wylie describing traits that could be predicted.
                    Mr. Wylie said the Facebook data was “the saving grace” that let his team deliver the models it had promised the Mercers.“We wanted as much as we could get,” he acknowledged. “Where it came from, who said we could have it — we weren’t really asking.”Mr. Nix tells a different story. Appearing before a parliamentary committee last month, he described Dr. Kogan’s contributions as “fruitless.”

An International EffortJust as Dr. Kogan’s efforts were getting underway, Mr. Mercer agreed to invest $15 million in a joint venture with SCL’s elections division. The partners devised a convoluted corporate structure, forming a new American company, owned almost entirely by Mr. Mercer, with a license to the psychographics platform developed by Mr. Wylie’s team, according to company documents. Mr. Bannon, who became a board member and investor, chose the name: Cambridge Analytica.The firm was effectively a shell. According to the documents and former employees, any contracts won by Cambridge, originally incorporated in Delaware, would be serviced by London-based SCL and overseen by Mr. Nix, a British citizen who held dual appointments at Cambridge Analytica and SCL. Most SCL employees and contractors were Canadian, like Mr. Wylie, or European.But in July 2014, an American election lawyer advising the company, Laurence Levy, warned that the arrangement could violate laws limiting the involvement of foreign nationals in American elections.In a memo to Mr. Bannon, Ms. Mercer and Mr. Nix, the lawyer, then at the firm Bracewell & Giuliani, warned that Mr. Nix would have to recuse himself “from substantive management” of any clients involved in United States elections. The data firm would also have to find American citizens or green card holders, Mr. Levy wrote, “to manage the work and decision making functions, relative to campaign messaging and expenditures.”In summer and fall 2014, Cambridge Analytica dived into the American midterm elections, mobilizing SCL contractors and employees around the country. Few Americans were involved in the work, which included polling, focus groups and message development for the John Bolton Super PAC, conservative groups in Colorado and the campaign of Senator Thom Tillis, the North Carolina Republican.Cambridge Analytica, in its statement to The Times, said that all “personnel in strategic roles were U.S. nationals or green card holders.” Mr. Nix “never had any strategic or operational role” in an American election campaign, the company said.Whether the company’s American ventures violated election laws would depend on foreign employees’ roles in each campaign, and on whether their work counted as strategic advice under Federal Election Commission rules.Cambridge Analytica appears to have exhibited a similar pattern in the 2016 election cycle, when the company worked for the campaigns of Mr. Cruz and then Mr. Trump. While Cambridge hired more Americans to work on the races that year, most of its data scientists were citizens of the United Kingdom or other European countries, according to two former employees.

Under the guidance of Brad Parscale, Mr. Trump’s digital director in 2016 and now the campaign manager for his 2020 re-election effort, Cambridge performed a variety of services, former campaign officials said. That included designing target audiences for digital ads and fund-raising appeals, modeling voter turnout, buying $5 million in television ads and determining where Mr. Trump should travel to best drum up support.Photo
    
            
        The White House advisers Stephen K. Bannon and Kellyanne Conway with Ms. Mercer at the 2017 inauguration. The firm helped the Trump campaign target voters.
                    Cambridge executives have offered conflicting accounts about the use of psychographic data on the campaign. Mr. Nix has said that the firm’s profiles helped shape Mr. Trump’s strategy — statements disputed by other campaign officials — but also that Cambridge did not have enough time to comprehensively model Trump voters.In a BBC interview last December, Mr. Nix said that the Trump efforts drew on “legacy psychographics” built for the Cruz campaign.After the LeakBy early 2015, Mr. Wylie and more than half his original team of about a dozen people had left the company. Most were liberal-leaning, and had grown disenchanted with working on behalf of the hard-right candidates the Mercer family favored.Cambridge Analytica, in its statement, said that Mr. Wylie had left to start a rival firm, and that it later took legal action against him to enforce intellectual property claims. It characterized Mr. Wylie and other former “contractors” as engaging in “what is clearly a malicious attempt to hurt the company.”Near the end of that year, a report in The Guardian revealed that Cambridge Analytica was using private Facebook data on the Cruz campaign, sending Facebook scrambling. In a statement at the time, Facebook promised that it was “carefully investigating this situation” and would require any company misusing its data to destroy it.Facebook verified the leak and — without publicly acknowledging it — sought to secure the information, efforts that continued as recently as August 2016. That month, lawyers for the social network reached out to Cambridge Analytica contractors. “This data was obtained and used without permission,” said a letter that was obtained by the Times. “It cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately.”Mr. Grewal, the Facebook deputy general counsel, said in a statement that both Dr. Kogan and “SCL Group and Cambridge Analytica certified to us that they destroyed the data in question.”Photo

            But copies of the data still remain beyond Facebook’s control. The Times viewed a set of raw data from the profiles Cambridge Analytica obtained.

While Mr. Nix has told lawmakers that the company does not have Facebook data, a former employee said that he had recently seen hundreds of gigabytes on Cambridge servers, and that the files were not encrypted.Today, as Cambridge Analytica seeks to expand its business in the United States and overseas, Mr. Nix has mentioned some questionable practices. This January, in undercover footage filmed by Channel 4 News in Britain and viewed by The Times, he boasted of employing front companies and former spies on behalf of political clients around the world, and even suggested ways to entrap politicians in compromising situations.

All the scrutiny appears to have damaged Cambridge Analytica’s political business. No American campaigns or “super PACs” have yet reported paying the company for work in the 2018 midterms, and it is unclear whether Cambridge will be asked to join Mr. Trump’s re-election campaign.In the meantime, Mr. Nix is seeking to take psychographics to the commercial advertising market. He has repositioned himself as a guru for the digital ad age — a “Math Man,” he puts it. In the United States last year, a former employee said, Cambridge pitched Mercedes-Benz, MetLife and the brewer AB InBev, but has not signed them on.

        KUALA LUMPUR —  The Malaysian government and the ruling party on Tuesday denied they had ever hired Cambridge Analytica, the British data analytics firm accused of improperly harvesting personal data from millions of Facebook users.The New York Times and the British Observer reported that Cambridge Analytica had acquired private data harvested from more than 50 million Facebook users to support Donald Trump's 2016 presidential election campaign.In a secretly recorded video by Britain's Channel 4 News, Cambridge Analytica officials were also recorded saying they have used a web of shell companies to disguise their activities in elections in Malaysia, Mexico and Brazil, among various countries where they have worked to sway election outcomes.""Contrary to media reports, neither Cambridge Analytica nor its parent company SCL Group have ever – now or in the past – been contracted, employed or paid in any way by Barisan Nasional, the Prime Minister's Office or any part of the Government of Malaysia,"" the office of Malaysian prime minister Najib Razak said on Tuesday. Barisan Nasional (BN) is Malaysia's ruling coalition.

SCL and Cambridge Analytica did not respond to requests by Reuters for comment regarding their work in Malaysia.

""The SCL representative also confirmed that he reported directly to Mukhriz Mahathir, not BN or the government,"" Najib's office said.Mukhriz told Reuters that the statement by PMO was misleading.""I categorically deny any contact with Cambridge Analytica at any time,"" he said. Earlier in the day, he denied receiving any analysis, data or advice from the firm.Mukhriz is the son of the former Malaysian premier Mahathir Mohamad, who is now the opposition's prime ministerial candidate.According to Cambridge Analytica's website, the firm ""supported Barisan Nasional in Kedah state with a targeted messaging campaign highlighting their school improvements since 2008."" It also notes how BN wrested power back from the opposition in the 2013 elections.Mukhriz was appointed chief minister of Kedah after the 2013 win, but he was sacked by the ruling party in 2016 after being critical of Najib in a corruption scandal.(Reporting by A.

        NEW YORK —  Facebook is facing the most serious crisis in its 14-year history as it deals with fallout from a major leak of user data to political consultants associated with the 2016 Trump campaign.Here's a look at the scandal and what it means.WHAT'S GOING ON?The U.K.-based data-mining firm Cambridge Analytica has been accused of lifting the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users without their permission in order to manipulate elections. A former employee of the firm, Christopher Wylie, played a role in that action, and later told his story to journalists.The crisis has renewed questions about Facebook's ability to protect the privacy of its users while also exploiting their personal details to fuel its lucrative advertising business. It has also deepened concerns about the social media network's ability to avoid being exploited to spread propaganda and sway elections.Authorities in both the U.S. and the U.K. are investigating both Facebook and Cambridge Analytica. Facebook shares have fallen and some users are contemplating deleting their accounts.

___WHAT DID CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA DO?Wylie says the firm sought Facebook information in order to build psychological profiles on a large portion of the U.S. electorate. He said the company was able to amass the database quickly with the help of an academic, Aleksander Kogan, who developed a Facebook app called ""This is Your Digital Life"" that appeared to be a personality test.

        That app vacuumed up information from users who gave the app permission to access their accounts — as well as additional data from their Facebook friends.Kogan paid about 200,000 people to take part; tens of millions of their friends were also caught in the data dragnet.___HOW HAS CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA RESPONDED?Cambridge Analytica has denied wrongdoing, and the firm said it deleted any data it received from Kogan and denied using any Facebook data in its political work. Facebook, however, said it recently learned from journalists that Cambridge Analytica may have kept some of the data, spurring an investigation.Kogan said he has been scapegoated by both Cambridge and Facebook. He says the data firm approached him for the project and assured him that everything he did was legal.___WHAT'S THE CONNECTION TO THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN?Federal election records show that the Trump campaign paid Cambridge Analytica roughly $6 million. But the campaign has denied using the firm's data, saying it relied on the Republic National Committee for its voter information.Cambridge Analytica was backed by the conservative billionaire Richard Mercer, a hedge-fund manager who supported the Trump campaign. At one point, the firm's vice president was Steve Bannon, who later became Trump's campaign chairman and White House adviser.Trump's former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, disclosed an advisory role with Cambridge Analytica last August. But the firm's parent company, Strategic Communication Laboratories, later said that position never materialized. Special counsel Robert Mueller is scrutinizing the connections between Trump's campaign and Cambridge Analytica.

Wylie, the whistleblower who worked for Cambridge from 2013 to 2015, said his team spoke to Americans in focus groups to identify deep-seated concerns and tested ways to tap into those fears through social media. He claims the slogans they developed later became the catchphrases of the Trump campaign, including ""drain the swamp"" and ""build the wall.""

Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix was caught bragging about the firm's pivotal role in the Trump campaign on a sting video from the U.K.'s Channel 4. He said Cambridge handled ""all the data, all the analytics, all the targeting"" for the campaign.___WHY ARE PEOPLE MAD AT FACEBOOK?The Cambridge Analytics fiasco appears to have crystallized the anxiety many people feel about Facebook's enormous sway over daily life and its massive data trove.A sell-off in Facebook shares reflects fear that the social network may face new regulations that could hurt profits — or that advertisers and users will sour on it.A U.K. parliamentary media committee is investigating how Facebook uses data, and has summoned CEO Mark Zuckerberg to testify. Various U.S. congressional committees are also seeking answers, although Democrats and Republicans have disagreed on what steps to take. Privacy advocates have asked the Federal Trade Commission to investigate as well.The hashtag #deletefacebook has been trending. Brian Acton, the co-founder of WhatsApp, which was acquired by Facebook four years ago for $19 billion, has joined the cause. But there are no signs, so far, that users — or advertisers — are abandoning Facebook in droves.___HOW IS FACEBOOK ADDRESSING THE CRISIS?After five days of silence, Zuckerberg released a Facebook post admitting mistakes and outlining steps to protect user data. He followed up with rare media appearances where he apologized for a breach of trust.Facebook's response, however, is limited to a narrow range of technical changes that will further limit the data apps can collect and lead to audits of apps that exhibit troubling behavior.Zuckerberg also emphasized steps the company has already taken, including reducing access outside apps had to user data in 2014. That came too late to stop Cambridge. The company said nothing about overhauling its data collection policies or taking steps to prevent the unauthorized political use of Facebook data.Facebook suspended Cambridge over allegations that it kept the improperly obtained user data. It has also suspended the access of Kogan and Wylie, as well as Cambridge's parent company, SCL.        Continue reading the main story

        LONDON —  Investigators from Britain's data watchdog searched the London offices of Cambridge Analytica, the data analytics firm at the center of a storm over allegations it improperly harvested Facebook data to target U.S. voters.About 20 officials, wearing black jackets with ""ICO Enforcement"" on them, arrived at the firm's central London offices on Friday evening soon after a High Court judge granted a search warrant sought by the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO).The officials concluded the search around 0300 GMT on Saturday. ""We will now need to assess and consider the evidence before deciding the next steps and coming to any conclusions,"" an ICO spokesperson said in a statement.The officials, who were let into the building by security guards, were seen checking books and papers through the windows of the second-floor offices on London’s busy New Oxford Street, a Reuters witness said.

        Britain is investigating whether Facebook, the world's largest social media network, did enough to protect data.U.S. lawmakers on Friday asked Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg to come to Congress to explain to explain how the data got into Cambridge Analytica's hands, adding to pressure on the firm, which is under fire from investors and advertisers.Separately on Friday, Britain's Guardian newspaper said a former Cambridge Analytica political consultant had accused the company's management of misleading the British public about work it did for a pro-Brexit group before the vote to leave the European Union.

Brittany Kaiser, a business development director at the company from 2014 until earlier this year, told the Guardian that Cambridge Analytica carried out data-crunching and analysis work for Leave.EU, while publicly denying it was doing so.Arron Banks, a major donor to Leave.EU, told the newspaper that Leave.EU did not receive any data or work from Cambridge Analytica although the UK Independence Party, which also campaigned for Brexit, gave the firm some of its data which the firm analyzed.""But it was not used in the Brexit campaign. Cambridge Analytica tried to make me pay for that work but I refused. It had nothing to do with us,"" Banks was quoted as saying.Efforts by the ICO to investigate Cambridge Analytica had hit a snag on Thursday after a judge adjourned its application to search the British consultancy group's office by 24 hours.U.S. and European lawmakers have demanded an explanation of how the British consulting firm gained access to the data in 2014 and why Facebook failed to inform its users, raising broader industry questions about consumer privacy.Facebook's Zuckerberg said on Wednesday that his company made mistakes in mishandling data and promised tougher steps to restrict developers access to data.

        NEW YORK —  The Latest on the alleged use of Facebook data to influence the U.S. presidential election (all times local):10:20 p.m.Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg says he believes it's time to impose more regulations on technology companies as they play an increasingly important role in the world. But he isn't spelling what kind of rules he would support beyond requiring clear disclosure about who is paying for online ads.Zuckerberg told CNN in an interview late Wednesday that it no longer is a question whether Facebook and other large tech companies should be more closely regulated. Instead, he says lawmakers need to work with companies to figure out what regulations make the most sense.The pressure to impose more controls on influential tech companies such as Facebook, Google and Amazon has been building as their services and products become more dominant, making it more difficult for rivals to build alternatives.Zuckerberg only said he thinks it's a good idea to require internet companies to disclose who is paying for online ads. That's a proposal under review in Congress after Facebook acknowledged Russian agents financed political ads during the 2016 presidential campaign, information about which wasn't disclosed until after the election.

        But he suggested other executives might be better qualified to field questions from lawmakers.Zuckerberg told CNN late Wednesday that he will bow to demands for him to appear before Congress if it's ""the right thing to do."" He added, however, that Facebook has other executives whose jobs are focused on certain areas that put them in a better position to give lawmakers the information they are seeking.That rationale is why Zuckerberg has sent other executives to appear in Congress to respond to hot-button issues, including whether Russian agents were able to manipulate Facebook's social network to sway the U.S. presidential election won by Donald Trump in 2016.Eventually, though, Zuckerberg said there may be situations where he is the ""sole authority."" He didn't say whether he had concluded if he is best suited to address the Facebook breakdown that led to Cambridge Analytica gaining access to personal information about 50 million Facebook users without their consent.___9:30 p.m.Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has finally apologized for weaknesses in the social network's policies that enabled an app to gain access to the personal information of 50 million users without their consent.Zuckerberg told CNN late Wednesday that he is ""really sorry,"" speaking in his first interview since news of the scandal broke last week.His mea culpa on cable television came a few hours after he acknowledged on his Facebook page that his company had made mistakes, but without saying he was sorry.During the CNN interview, Zuckerberg also expressed regrets for not doing more after Facebook first discovered that Cambridge Analytica had gained access to a broad swath of Facebook users' data in 2015.

Wolfe Murray said he declined the offer because he does not work for political parties.

        WASHINGTON —  President Barack Obama's 2012 re-election campaign mined supporters' personal data from Facebook to benefit its voter turnout program. But former campaign officials said Wednesday they accessed and used the information in vastly different ways than Cambridge Analytica, the firm connected to President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign accused of improperly lifting data on 50 million Facebook users.Former Obama advisers said they collected the data with their own app, complied with the social media platform's terms of service and received permission from supporters. An estimated 1 million Obama supporters gave the campaign access to their Facebook data.In most cases, Obama supporters who signed on to the campaign's mailing list were asked to authorize the campaign's Facebook app, allowing it to access certain aspects of their profile, including their posts, likes, photos, demographics and similar data from their Facebook friends. The Obama data was used in voter turnout efforts, with a focus on young voters in key battleground states, and former campaign officials said the data was kept secure and not sold to or acquired from third parties.Ex-Obama aides said their practices did not mirror those of Cambridge Analytica, which has been accused of acquiring personal data in unauthorized ways. The British political research firm has suspended CEO Alexander Nix pending an investigation.

Facebook said in a statement that the tweet was inaccurate, adding that ""both the Obama and Romney campaigns had access to the same tools, and no campaign received any special treatment from Facebook.""Rayid Ghani, who was chief scientist on the Obama 2012 campaign, wrote in a Medium post that the campaign only contacted people who had provided them with access to their email address. ""We did not get any contact information for their friend and did not (and could not) contact any of their friends directly,"" he wrote. He said the campaign ""did not scrape everything available on facebook about everyone we could.""""All we could do was ask our 'primary' supporters to contact their friends and we would recommend who those friends were based on the data they allowed us to access,"" Ghani said. Facebook ""did not look the other way, because they did not need to,"" he added.The tech giant in 2015 shut down app developers' ability to siphon off the data of Facebook users who used their apps.Timothy Carone, a University of Notre Dame professor specializing in data science, said in an email that it's unclear the 2012 Obama campaign could have done what Cambridge Analytica did in 2016, adding that would require a deeper dive into the 2012 campaign practices.

        LONDON —  The head of Trump-affiliated data-mining firm Cambridge Analytica has been suspended, while government authorities are bearing down on both the firm and Facebook over allegations the firm stole data from 50 million Facebook users to manipulate elections.Cambridge's board of directors suspended CEO Alexander Nix pending an investigation after Nix boasted of various unsavory services to an undercover reporter for Britain's Channel 4 News.Channel 4 News broadcast clips Tuesday that also show Nix saying his data-mining firm played a major role in securing Donald Trump's victory in the 2016 presidential elections.Nix said the firm handled ""all the data, all the analytics, all the targeting"" and said Cambridge used emails with a ""self-destruct timer"" to make its role more difficult to trace.

        Cambridge has denied wrongdoing, and Trump's campaign has said it didn't use Cambridge's data.Facebook also drew continued criticism for its alleged inaction to protect users' privacy. Earlier Tuesday, the chairman of the U.K. parliamentary media committee, Damian Collins, said his group has repeatedly asked Facebook how it uses data. He said Facebook officials ""have been misleading to the committee.""The committee summoned Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to testify.""It is now time to hear from a senior Facebook executive with the sufficient authority to give an accurate account of this catastrophic failure of process,"" Collins wrote Zuckerberg. ""Given your commitment at the start of the New Year to 'fixing' Facebook, I hope that this representative will be you.""Leading Democrats in the U.S. Senate also called on Zuckerberg to testify. Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, called Facebook's latest privacy scandal a ""danger signal."" She wants Zuckerberg's assurances that Facebook is prepared to take the lead on security measures that protect people's privacy — or Congress may step in.Facebook sidestepped questions on whether Zuckerberg would appear, saying instead that it's currently focused on conducting its own reviews.The request to appear comes as Britain's information commissioner said she was using all her legal powers to investigate the social-media giant and Cambridge Analytica.Commissioner Elizabeth Denham is pursuing a warrant to search Cambridge Analytica's servers. She has also asked Facebook to cease its own audit of Cambridge Analytica's data use.""Our advice to Facebook is to back away and let us go in and do our work,"" she said.Facebook has weathered many such blow-ups before and is used to apologizing and moving on. But the stakes are bigger this time. The latest scandal has some people reconsidering their relationship status with the social network, though there isn't much of anywhere else to go.

Cambridge Analytica said it is committed to helping the U.K. investigation. However, Denham's office said the firm failed to meet a deadline to produce the information requested.Denham said the prime allegation against Cambridge Analytica is that it acquired personal data in an unauthorized way, adding that the data provisions act requires services like Facebook to have strong safeguards against misuse of data.

Chris Wylie, who once worked for Cambridge Analytica, was quoted as saying the company used the data to build psychological profiles so voters could be targeted with ads and stories.Wylie has agreed to be interviewed by Democrats on the U.S. House Intelligence Committee. A date has not been set, and it's unclear if Republicans on the panel will attend.On Tuesday, Wylie said he found Facebook's reaction to the revelations bizarre. He told an audience at the Frontline Club in London that before the story broke, Facebook had agreed to work with him to improve its platform. But he said he was blindsided on Friday with a news release that identified him as a suspect in the case.Cambridge Analytica found itself in further allegations of wrongdoing. Britain's Channel 4 used an undercover investigation to record Nix saying that the company could use unorthodox methods to wage successful political campaigns for clients.In footage released Monday, Nix said the company could ""send some girls"" around to a rival candidate's house, suggesting that girls from Ukraine are beautiful and effective in this role.He also said the company could ""offer a large amount of money"" to a rival candidate and have the whole exchange recorded so it could be posted on the internet to show that the candidate was corrupt.Nix says in a statement that he deeply regrets his role in the meeting and has apologized to staff.""I am aware how this looks, but it is simply not the case,"" he said. ""I must emphatically state that Cambridge Analytica does not condone or engage in entrapment, bribes or so-called 'honeytraps', and nor does it use untrue material for any purposes.""

Nix told the BBC that the Channel 4 sting was ""intended to embarrass us"".""We see this as a coordinated attack by the media that's been going on for very, very many months in order to damage the company that had some involvement with the election of Donald Trump,"" he said.The data harvesting used by Cambridge Analytica has also triggered calls for further investigation from the European Union, as well as federal and state officials in the United States.On Tuesday, a dozen consumer-advocacy organizations pressed the Federal Trade Commission in the U.S. to investigate whether the release of data violated an agreement Facebook signed with the FTC in 2011 offering privacy assurances.The move comes after Bloomberg News first reported the FTC could already be investigating. The FTC hasn't confirmed the investigation but said it takes ""any allegations of violations of our consent decrees very seriously.""___AP Technology Writers Mae Anderson and Anick Jesdanun in New York and AP writers Mary Clare Jalonick and Richard Lardner in Washington contributed to this story.

        The Congress later appeared to have deleted the link to its app entirely on Monday, prompting Amit Malviya, the head of the BJP's IT cell, to tweet, ""What is the Congress party trying to hide?""The Congress responded on Twitter saying it was forced to remove the app as an incorrect link was being circulated and people were being misled.

The security researcher, who has previously highlighted some vulnerabilities in India's national identity card project and who tweets under the pseudonym Elliot Alderson, caused a flurry on Saturday with a series of tweets saying the Modi app was sending personal user data to a third-party domain that was traced to an American company.""Hi! My name is Narendra Modi. I am India's Prime Minister. When you sign up for my official App, I give all your data to my friends in American companies,"" wrote opposition Congress Party Chief Rahul Gandhi in a Twitter message on Sunday.The BJP responded on Twitter, saying Gandhi was trying to divert attention. The BJP has accused the Congress of engaging Cambridge Analytica in India, a charge the opposition party has denied.Alderson, who initially pointed out that the Modi app was sharing data with a third party without the consent of users, earlier on Sunday posted a new tweet saying the app had ""quietly"" updated its privacy policy after his previous tweets.Reuters could not independently verify Alderson's claims.Modi has not commented on the issue.(Reporting by Devidutta Tripathy and Euan Rocha; Editing by Nick Macfie)        Continue reading the main story

        WASHINGTON —  The U.S. Senate voted 94-2 on Monday to advance legislation to make it easier to penalize operators of websites that facilitate online sex trafficking, setting up final passage of a bill as soon as Tuesday that would chip away at a bedrock legal shield for the technology industry.The U.S. House of Representatives passed the legislation overwhelmingly last month. It is expected to be sent to and signed by President Donald Trump later this week.The bill's expected passage marks one of the most concrete actions in recent years from the U.S. Congress to tighten regulation of internet firms, which have drawn scrutiny from lawmakers in both parties over the past year because of an array of concerns regarding the size and influence of their platforms.The Senate vote to limit debate on the sex trafficking legislation came as Facebook endured withering scrutiny over its data protection practices after reports that political analytics firm Cambridge Analytica harvested the private data on more than 50 million Facebook users through inappropriate means.

Several major internet companies, including Facebook and Alphabet's Google, have been reluctant in the past to support any congressional effort to dent what is known as Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, a decades-old law that protects them from liability for the activities of their users.

The legislation is a result of years of law enforcement lobbying for a crackdown on the online classified site backpage.com, which is used for sex advertising.It would make it easier for states and sex-trafficking victims to sue social media networks, advertisers and others that fail to keep exploitative material off their platforms.Some critics have warned that the measure would weaken Section 230 in a way that would only serve to help established internet giants, which possess larger resources to police their content, and not adequately address the problem.Republican Senator Rand Paul and Democratic Senator Ron Wyden cast the only no votes.(Reporting by Dustin Volz; Editing by Peter Cooney)        Continue reading the main story

DUBLIN — As Ireland prepares to vote in May on a referendum on whether to repeal its ban on abortion, anti-abortion campaigners can be seen rallying most weekdays on the streets of Dublin, outside Parliament, and at universities, news media buildings and the offices of human rights groups.They arrive wearing body cameras and bearing placards with graphic images of aborted fetuses.But not all of them are Irish.Of the eight members of the anti-abortion Irish Center for Bio-Ethical Reform who protested outside the offices of The Irish Times on a recent weekday, only three — including the group’s leader, Jean Engela — are Irish. The others include Americans and a Hungarian.“We try to be as multinational as the abortion industry, and they make no apologies for sending in their international affiliates to pontificate to the Irish people,” said Dr. Engela.

The protests — relatively small but highly visible here in the Irish capital — are an emblem of the strong emotions as the country prepares to vote in late May on whether to retain the Eighth Amendment of the Irish Constitution, which bans abortion in nearly all circumstances and was itself enacted by a referendum, in 1983. (Abortion was illegal before 1983, but the amendment made it even harder to terminate a pregnancy, even to save to mother’s life.)        Continue reading the main story

        To the age-old debates around abortion — including questions of when life begins and of women’s control over their reproductive rights — the referendum has added a new dimension of concern about potential outside interference in the vote.An ethics regulator recently ordered two abortion-rights groups, Amnesty International Ireland and the Abortion Rights Campaign, to return grants of $150,000 and $25,000 to George Soros’s Open Society Foundations. It said the money was a foreign political donation intended to affect the outcome of a referendum or election, and therefore banned.But so far it does not appear that any anti-abortion groups have been asked to return overseas donations, despite reports that money is being openly raised on their behalf, particularly in the United States.One American group, the Pro-Life Action League, told an Irish newspaper in 2012 that anti-abortion groups were raising hundreds of thousands of dollars to support Irish anti-abortion groups like Youth Defence, which has been linked to far-right movements in Europe.Youth Defence did not respond to a request for comment. The Pro-Life Action League’s executive director, Eric J. Scheidler, said that the remarks concerned American support for the Irish anti-abortion movement over several decades, and said his group had not raised money for the current campaign.The Irish Center for Bio-Ethical Reform, which picketed The Irish Times, receives foreign funding but claims to be exempt from government oversight. “We are an educational body,” Dr. Engela said.He denied that the protest had anything to do with the coming vote, and asserted that some of the volunteers were full-time activists with their own sources of funding.

Some commentators argue that anti-abortion groups are not being held to the same stringent standard as abortion-rights groups.Theresa Reidy, a political scientist at University College Cork, said that there was a long history of overseas interests taking sides in Irish referendums, particularly on issues like the European Union. Over the last decade, even as support for the abortion ban has waned, concerns about possible outside interference have risen, she said.Photo

            Siobhan Mullally, of the Irish Center for Human Rights at the National University of Ireland, Galway, said the problem of undeclared foreign funding went beyond the abortion debate, and was “also a question about how charities are funded in general.”The Roman Catholic Church, long a major power in Ireland, was the main driver in the 1983 referendum. The church also opposed, successfully, a referendum in 1986 that would have legalized divorce. In the decades since, however, its social and moral authority has been gravely weakened by a number of scandals, most notably clerical child sex abuse.The church could not prevent the legalization of contraception and was on the losing side in referendums that legalized divorce in 1995 and same-sex marriage in 2015.

As a result, today’s anti-abortion activists are less overtly religious in their arguments. Instead, they are turning to arguments that abortion harms women’s health. They are also turning to social media tools.After recent revelations about the misuse of Facebook data to sway Britain’s referendum on European Union membership in 2016, and the United States presidential election later that year, fears are growing similar tactics might be used in the referendum campaign.The Save the 8th Campaign, an anti-abortion group, has hired Kanto Systems, a London-based political consultancy, to help run its campaign.Kanto Systems’s founder, Thomas Borwick, was chief technology officer for the Vote Leave campaign in Britain, and developed a canvassing app for Cambridge Analytica, the data-mining organization that exploited Facebook data on behalf of the 2016 Trump campaign.

Mr. Borwick said that he himself had not worked for the Trump campaign, and referred a reporter to a statement from Save the 8th, which said that Kanto would be performing “some data analytics for us” but would not be engaged in “any voter profiling or voter targeting.”John McGuirk, a spokesman for Save the 8th, said that in the Irish electoral system, which does not have online voter rolls, individually targeted advertising of the sort practiced by Cambridge Analytica would not be possible. “In terms of targeting advertising at individual voters, we couldn’t do that even if we wanted to, which we don’t,” he said.The Times of London reported that the Pro Life Campaign, Ireland’s largest umbrella anti-abortion group, has retained uCampaign, a Washington firm that has developed apps for the Trump campaign, the National Rifle Association, the Republican National Committee and Vote Leave. (Neither uCampaign nor the Pro Life Campaign responded to requests for comment.)The Transparent Referendum Initiative, a small group of Irish technology advocates, said it had already detected paid social media campaigns stealthily targeting Irish voters. This month, the group introduced a crowdsourced monitoring tool to detect and investigate anonymous or vaguely sourced paid advertising on Facebook. It has already identified 92 such ads relating to the Irish referendum, 55 with anti-abortion messages and 37 in support of abortion rights.Political advertising is banned on Irish television and radio, but the online world is a different matter.“There is no law against someone anywhere else in the world signing a commercial contract with a British company to use foreign money or unknown money, that is not going through any official regulated campaign, in order to influence an Irish vote,” said Liz Carolan of the Transparent Referendum Initiative. “There’s a serious vulnerability in our democratic system. And it’s now being exploited by incredibly sophisticated campaign techniques, and Facebook doesn’t have to tell us who’s doing it.”Responding to the Cambridge Analytica revelations, the Irish government announced last week that it planned to give Irish regulators new powers to curb external influence on Irish voters.A spokeswoman for Facebook’s Dublin office said that the company agreed with the need for more transparency in advertising, and that it was developing a new tool to help people identify paid ads in their timelines and to identify and label political content. However, she said, the tools will not be ready in time for the May referendum.

        AHMEDABAD, India —  Allegations that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's official smartphone app is shipping Indians' personal data to servers abroad have morphed into a political scandal in a country where privacy rules are weak and the data mining runs rampant.Indian opposition leader Rahul Gandhi taunted the prime minister after a pseudonymous researcher found that Modi's app was pumping private information such as citizens' email addresses to servers controlled by a U.S. firm.""Hi! My name is Narendra Modi. I am India's Prime Minister,"" Gandhi wrote in a sarcastic Twitter post published Sunday. ""When you sign up for my official App, I give all your data to my friends in American companies.""Modi's party has defended the app, saying the harvested data is being used ""only for analytics.""But the app's makers quietly rewrote their privacy policy after the news broke late last week. Initially , it read: ""Your personal information and contact details shall remain confidential."" Now it reads: ""Certain information maybe processed by third party services.""

Mark Zuckerberg at the company’s 2017 F8 Developer Conference in San Jose, Calif.CreditJustin Sullivan/Getty ImagesImageBy David LeonhardtMarch 21, 2018This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday.The election of Donald Trump was so shocking — and damaging to the country — that many people went looking for a scapegoat. There was a long list of candidates.Hillary’s flawed campaign. Bernie’s long campaign. The Electoral College. The media. Sexist voters. Racist voters. Economically anxious voters. Nonvoters. James Comey. Anthony Weiner. Vladimir Putin. Twitter. And Facebook.By spreading false news stories and giving a megaphone to Russian trolls, Facebook — a vastly larger social network than Twitter — played a meaningful role in the presidential campaign. Of course, so did many other suspects on the list. There was no single factor that allowed Trump to win. It was a confluence.If anything, the role of Facebook and its executives has sometimes been exaggerated. “Whatever role they played surely pales in relative importance to a whole host of other factors,” Ben Thompson, the author of the Stratechery blog, pointed out yesterday (in his subscriber-only newsletter), “and it makes sense that Facebook executives would feel persecuted on that front.”But, as Thompson explains, “The problem comes when arguing about details results in missing the big picture: fake news on Facebook may not have been the deciding factor many think it was, but Facebook’s effect on the news surely mattered.” And Facebook’s executives have indeed missed this big picture, claiming that their company played no significant role in Trump’s victory.That’s simply wrong, and the company’s defensiveness is one reason that its image problems are becoming significant.Facebook, as Vox’s Emily Stuart wrote yesterday, “is under siege from lawmakers, regulators, users, shareholders, and even its own employees amid revelations that Cambridge Analytics, a data analytics firm used by the Trump campaign in the 2016 election, secretly harvested personal data from 50 million of its users.”In a 2014 speech, Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s C.E.O., said, “In every single thing we do, we always put people first.” By that, he said he meant that Facebook would give people “control over how they share their information.”Facebook didn’t do that.“Where is Mark Zuckerberg?” asks Recode’s Kurt Wagner. “Facebook has dealt with these kinds of firestorms before,” Wagner writes. “But this time feels different. Users are fed up. Politicians are fed up. And investors are clearly concerned: Facebook just had its worst two-day stock performance since 2012, the year the company IPO’d. It has lost more than $50 billion off its market cap.”“It’s time” for Zuckerberg and other top Facebook officials “to come and testify,” Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said yesterday. Meanwhile, at the White House ... “This is depressing,” Matt Glassman of Georgetown University tweeted, referring to the story about Trump ignoring his national security advisers and cozying up to Putin on a phone call. “But boy, think about the atmosphere at the WH that leads to stuff like this leaking. Toxic.” In The Times. Kevin Rudd, the former prime minister of Australia, is an astute observer of China, and I recommend his new op-ed on Xi Jinping.

        (Reuters) - Facebook Inc's shares fell more than 4 percent in premarket trading after media reports that a political consultancy that worked on President Donald Trump's campaign gained inappropriate access to data on 50 million Facebook users.The move would knock $23.8 billion off the social network's market value of $538 billion (382.88 billion pounds) as of Friday's close and shares in other social media companies including Twitter Inc and Snap Inc also dipped in early deals in New York.One Wall Street analyst said the reports raised 'systemic problems' with Facebook's business model and a number said it could spur far deeper regulatory scrutiny of the platform.The head of European Parliament said on Monday that EU lawmakers will investigate whether the data misuse has taken place, adding the allegation is an unacceptable violation of citizens' privacy rights.

In January, when Facebook announced changes to its newsfeed which it said would hit user engagement in the near term, shares fell 4.5 percent in one day.""It's clear with more 'heat in the kitchen from the Beltway' that further modest changes to their business model around advertising and news feeds/content could be in store over the next 12 to 18 months,"" said Daniel Ives, research analyst at GBH Insights.He also argued that the issue was ""background noise"" on which Facebook could calm any regulatory nerves through further investments in security, ad content AI, improved content algorithms and screening mechanisms.No analysts had so far changed their price targets or recommendations on Facebook in response to the reports. Wall Street is largely bullish on the stock with 40 of 44 analysts recommending the stock ""buy"" or higher.

Now the intellectual underpinnings of the tech rally are being seriously tested.

Stocks in the best-known tech companies have plunged in recent days. The NYSE FANG+ index, which tracks the share price of 10 companies, including Facebook, Apple and Amazon, has fallen nearly 14 percent from its recent high. Given that the index has soared 50 percent in just the past 12 months, the recent decline could just be the sort of sell-off that punctuates any long-term rally.

        Still, several large tech companies suddenly face challenges that could undermine their ability to transform whole industries. And as we’ve seen after previous fervors, investors can take a long time to regain their faith.Facebook is down 20 percent from its recent high. Most of the slide came after news reports showing how the company’s data was misused. Investors have to grapple with the possibility that Facebook won’t be sharing as much data as it does, undermining its ability to generate ever-increasing amounts of advertising revenue.Nvidia, a computer chip maker intent on being a leader in automated driving technology, is off 12 percent from its recent high. The company said on Tuesday that it would halt tests of its autonomous driving technology on public roads after an Uber self-driving car hit and killed a pedestrian in Arizona.Tesla is not a tech stock, but it is included in the FANG+ index, and its supporters believe deeply in its power to revolutionize the auto industry. Growing fears about Tesla’s ability to finance its expansion have helped drag its stock down 33 percent from its recent high. Ominously, the price of Tesla’s bonds is also falling, signaling that the company is losing the confidence of creditors.Of course, on their march higher, tech stocks overcame obstacles, like management problems at Uber and the poor performance of Snap’s initial public offering.But the latest problems have raised deeper, broader doubts, and that may keep the uncertainty around longer. Investors have viewed automated driving technology as a huge potential source of growth for some companies. But after the Uber incident in Arizona, those companies may take a more realistic look at what they have to spend to create a technology that is efficient and safe, and conclude that they have to pull out of the race or pare back. Users of social media and regulators may prevent social media companies from sharing so much of their data with advertisers, and that could restrain revenue growth.And if the passion for two or three big tech companies wanes, the cooling may spread.— Peter EavisAmazon has shed more than $50 billion in market value.The reason?

Reports that President Trump wants to rein in the e-commerce giant.Jonathan Swan of Axios, citing anonymous sources, reported:“Trump has talked about changing Amazon’s tax treatment because he’s worried about mom-and-pop retailers being put out of business.”Mr. Swan added:“Trump’s wealthy friends tell him Amazon is destroying their businesses. His real estate buddies tell him — and he agrees — that Amazon is killing shopping malls and brick-and-mortar retailers.”Shares of Amazon have tumbled more than 7 percent at one point Wednesday, but they pared those losses after a White House official told Reuters there were no specific policy changes related to Amazon being considered at the moment. But the official added that the administration is always looking at different options on a range of policy issues.How concerned should investors be?GBH Insights analyst Daniel Ives writes:“While it’s now a hand holding time for Amazon given this new regulatory potential threat, we believe the reality of these worries altering the company’s business model and future tax structure are low and we would be buyers of the name on weakness.”Guess which companies are benefiting from Amazon's woes? Retailers, the FT points out.On a day when the stocks on Wall Street are flat, Macy’s was up 3.5 percent, J.C. Penney has gained 5.5 percent, Walmart rose 1.7 percent, Target increased 1.8 percent, and Kohl’s was up 2.4 percent.Photo

            Are investors waking up to Tesla’s real problem?The electric carmaker’s shares are down 7 percent Wednesday, after plunging 8 percent on Tuesday.Tuesday’s slide was driven, in part, by the National Transportation Safety Board’s announcement that it was investigating a fatal crash last week involving a Tesla vehicle in California. News that Jaguar Land Rover was teaming up with Alphabet Inc.’s Waymo unit probably didn't help either.But the continued decline in Tesla’s stock — its shares are down more than 20 percent since mid-March — speaks to the bigger concern surrounding Tesla: How it funds itself.Investors have grown increasingly worried as Tesla burns through cash and struggles to meet its own production goals for the Model 3. Late Tuesday, Moody’s downgraded Tesla’s credit rating further into junk territory and said its outlook on the company is negative. The credit ratings agency cited production delays and said Tesla may soon need to raise more than $2 billion.Those concerns can be seen not just in Tesla’s stock price but also in the trading of its debt. The FT points out that “Tesla’s eight-year bond maturing in 2025 traded on Wednesday at 87.6 cents to the dollar, the lowest since issuance. The yield has surged to 7.5 percent from 6.59 percent on Monday.”Liam Denning of Bloomberg Gadfly writes:“Challenges on the factory floor and the balance sheet are converging. Drawing inexorably closer to a refinancing wall, Tesla needs a real shot of confidence, and capital, to keep its money machine turning over this year.
“Given Tuesday’s bond blowout, that almost certainly means tapping the equity market again. Nothing like being a motivated seller to put a floor under a stock price, right?”Is Twitter vulnerable to privacy regulation?The fallout from Facebook’s Cambridge Analytica scandal has spread to Twitter.The stock tumbled 12 percent Tuesday after Citron Research’s Andrew Left said he was betting against the social media company because of its vulnerability to regulation around how it handles user data.

            Why the first Trump trade deal may not lead to othersPresident Trump has scored a significant trade deal with South Korea.But with Mr. Trump preparing to meet with North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un — who just took an armored train trip to Beijing — and the North apparently pressing on with nuclear developments, an “America first” trade stance was far from the only thing pushing the South to sign. More from Michael D. Shear and Alan Rappeport:The political success of the trade agreement — and its ability to be replicated in other negotiations — is not guaranteed. Many countries have reacted coolly to Washington’s pugilistic approach to trade, viewing the president’s preference to punch first and negotiate later as counter to global interests.The Trump administration continues to ramp up its trade rhetoric with China. Unidentified sources told Bloomberg that it is considering invoking an emergency law to restrict Chinese investments in sensitive U.S. tech. A separate plan to enact tariffs on $60 billion of Chinese goods has left companies wondering which industries will be targeted. Other Asian countries increasingly fear being caught in the crossfire of a trade war, the WSJ reports.And nations are already reacting to Trump’s trade moves, erecting  barriers to stop the steel and aluminum that faces tariffs in the U.S. being dumped in their markets.

The man who started all this, the Cambridge Analytica whistle-blower Christopher Wylie, spoke to British lawmakers on Tuesday and revealed that an employee of Palantir Technologies had suggested that Cambridge Analytica build an app to gain access to Facebook networks. Palantir was co-founded by Peter Thiel, who sits on the Facebook board.Separately, New Zealand’s privacy commissioner has accused Facebook of breaking a law by refusing to give a man information about him held in other users’ accounts.

            The self-driving slowdown continuesNvidia — the chip maker whose autonomous-vehicle technology is used by Volkswagen, Tesla, Audi and hundreds of other firms — said it would halt its own tests on self-driving cars, after an autonomous Uber vehicle struck and killed a pedestrian in Arizona. Its shares dropped 7.8 percent.Here’s Roger Lanctot, an automotive technology analyst with Strategy Analytics:Nvidia has no choice but to take steps in the context of the fear, uncertainty and outrage likely to be stimulated by a robot car killing a human being. This is precisely the type of event that is capable of slaying a nascent industry in the crib.Tesla also tumbled 8.2 percent, after the National Transportation Safety Board said it was conducting its second crash investigation of the year involving one of the company’s cars. There’s also anxiety about whether it will hit production goals.

        FRANKFURT —  Anyone tempted to #DeleteFacebook after the personal data of millions of users fell into the hands of a political consultancy is still likely to be monitored by the social network, which tracks nearly 30 percent of global website traffic.And Google, in various guises, shadows 64 percent of all web-browsing worldwide, a recent study (https://www.ghostery.com/lp/study) of 200,000 German users by Cliqz, using its anti-tracking product Ghostery, said.Neither Facebook nor Google responded to emails asking whether they viewed the Cliqz research as representative.A larger study (https://webtransparency.cs.princeton.edu/webcensus) of web trackers by researchers at Princeton University in 2016 produced similar results, with Google Analytics and other Google trackers taking the top five places, followed by Facebook.

        ""We prevent companies like this from spying on you,"" chief executive Marc Al-Hames told Reuters.From private browsers like Cliqz to anti-trackers and ad blockers, such firms seek to shield users from intrusion. Mainstream providers in Europe are also trying to differentiate themselves by stressing privacy.""Every time there is a scandal like this at the U.S. companies it boosts our business,"" Ralph Dommermuth, founder and CEO of Germany's United Internet, told Reuters. The company offers encrypted email services, hosted in Germany under its strict privacy laws, and does not sell users' data.United Internet and others recently formed a 'Login Alliance' offering a single, secure way for their 50 million users to give consent in compliance with new European Union privacy rules that enter into force in May.That contrasts with rampant use in the past of Facebook Login by companies to tap personal data.VOLCANIC ERUPTIONPrivacy advocates have warned for years that Facebook's terms of use left it open to data harvesting.Psychologist Aleksandr Kogan collected data on 50 million Facebook by creating a personality quiz taken by a few hundred thousand people. In consenting to its terms, they let the app collect information on their Facebook 'friends' - without their knowledge or consent.The U.S. academic passed that data to Cambridge Analytica, which applied data science and psychographic profiling to back Donald Trump's election campaign - violating Facebook's rules.

AdBlock Plus has 100 million users seeking protection from ads such as auto-play videos. It is not a privacy product as such, although users can tweak settings to increase protection.Most people do not mind normal search advertising, but object to intrusive third-party ads, Williams said.LOSS OF FACEBOOKThe Facebook leak shows that the data should never have been collected, Cliqz's Al-Hames said:""We should all be outraged but nobody should be surprised. Everybody who has data will eventually lose that data.""Cliqz has an icon that shows how many private data points trackers are trying to access when you visit a site.Its anti-tracking feature substitutes private data with random information to throw them off your trail, while there is also an anti-phishing feature to thwart data theft.Cliqz does store browsing history at the 'edge' - on desktops and smartphones – and uses this to personalize search.Without giving direct access, it also lets firms use that information to target adverts using its MyOffrz product in a way that complies with the new EU privacy rules.""We can deliver a targeted ad - but it doesn't mean that there is information about you on our servers,"" Al-Hames said.Cliqz has around half a million active users, while Ghostery, the browser extension that monitors which web servers are being called from a given page, has around 7 million users.

Here’s what we’re watching:• So you want to be Deutsche Bank’s next C.E.O...• Investors are selling tech again.• Will Wall Street’s top regulator keep going after bad bankers?• More potential limits on gun sales• Facebook’s growing political troubles• Uber’s self-driving travailsGet this in your inbox each morning. Sign up here.So you want to be Deutsche Bank’s next C.E.O...Imagine you are applying to be the C.E.O. of Deutsche Bank now that it’s reportedly seeking a successor to John Cryan, the bank’s current chief.You survey the bank’s numbers to get a sense of the opportunities and challenges you’d face.Staring you in the face is the stock price, down nearly 30 percent this year. Ugly, but it could be a good entry point. It gives you time to try out some tough measures aimed at improving Deutsche Bank’s performance. Even if those moves produce near-term losses, the stock may not dive, given how far it’s already fallen.

Then you look at the strength of Deutsche Bank’s capital, as expressed by a regulatory measure called the common equity tier 1 capital ratio. That’s at 14 percent, a solid-looking level, achieved in part by an €8 billion equity raise last year. In theory, you have something to spend on your chosen plans.

        But then you realize that Deutsche Bank’s share price is now back at the level at which the bank sold those shares. Shareholders must be livid. Not only that, Deutsche Bank’s stock market value is less than 40 percent of its net worth as stated on its balance sheet (its stock price is €11.30 and its book value per share is €30.16.) When a company trades at a hefty discount to its net worth, it either needs to raise a lot of new capital, which doesn’t seem to be the case at Deutsche Bank, or investors have serious doubts about the company’s business model.“So, I’ll rejig the bank’s business model,” you say to yourself, “that’s what new C.E.O.’s do!”You look for ways and stumble upon an unavoidable obstacle. Deutsche Bank is heavily dependent on Wall Street revenue, which can be far more unpredictable than revenue from other businesses. Last year, revenue from Deutsche Bank’s corporate and investment bank, which has struggled to keep up with its peers, accounted for 54 percent of the bank’s overall revenue. Compare that with JPMorgan Chase, whose investment bank accounted for a third of its revenue last year. And you are stuck with the Wall Street operations; no one wants to buy an investment bank with €1.2 trillion in assets.Maybe you can cut costs, another go-to tactic of an incoming C.E.O. Indeed, Deutsche Bank’s investment bank employees seem better paid than their counterparts at other firms. Going by a back of the envelope calculation, the unit’s compensation expense is equivalent to 44 percent of its revenue (excluding the interest the investment bank earns on its assets.) That’s higher than the 39 percent ratio for JPMorgan’s investment bank last year, and 41 percent for Goldman Sachs. Maybe you could slash the pay of bankers and traders.Sorry, Mr. Cryan tried that.— Peter Eavis

Investors are selling tech again.The roller coaster ride in tech continues.The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite tumbled nearly 3 percent, while the Dow Jones industrial average and the S.&P. 500 fell 1.4 percent and 1.7 percent.Tech companies in the S.&P. 500 tech sector slid 3.4 percent, the steepest decline among the index’s 11 main sectors.Chip makers were among the hardest hit on the day. Shares of Nvidia dropped 7.8 percent after it said it was halting tests on self-driving cars.

Nvidia’s slide weighed on the shares of rival chip makers. Micron Technologies fell 5.7 percent, and AMD dropped 4.2 percent.But semiconductor companies were hardly the only ones getting pummeled. The famed FANG stocks, among the biggest gainers over the past year, tumbled Tuesday. Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google-parent Alphabet all finished down more than 4.5 percent.Tesla tumbled 8.2 percent on news that the National Transportation Safety Board is conducting its second investigation this year into a Tesla car crash. The stock is off nearly 20 percent since March 12 on increasing concerns that the electric-car maker will fall short of its production goals for the Model 3.Twitter dropped 12 percent after Andrew Left’s Citron Research said it was shorting the social media company.Tuesday’s fall continued the recent volatility in American stocks, and specifically, the shares of tech companies. Enthusiasm about the technology sector had long propelled stock markets to new heights. But the specter of intensifying regulation of the industry has taken the sheen off. Last week tech stocks dragged the broader markets to their worst week in more than two years. The selling took a break on Monday as the S.&P. 500’s tech sector rose 4 percent pushing the index to its best day in almost three years.Photo

            Will Wall Street’s top regulator keep going after bad bankers?A vigorous debate is taking place over who should become the next head of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, a powerful regulator on Wall Street’s front lines.Contenders for the post should address one question: What will you do to clean up the culture at banks?William C. Dudley, the outgoing president of the New York Fed, had made improving the culture at the firms he oversaw a key initiative of his tenure of at the institution.

When Mr. Dudley took the helm in 2009, the financial crisis had left the New York Fed’s reputation as a regulator damaged. The institution had not done enough to address the severe weaknesses at the banks it oversaw, like Citigroup. Early on, Mr. Dudley commissioned a review of the New York Fed’s bank supervision department and then overhauled it. But in 2012, JPMorgan Chase, also overseen by the New York Fed, suffered huge trading losses in what was known as the London Whale scandal. The New York Fed was faulted.Following the embarrassing London Whale imbroglio, Mr. Dudley used his bully pulpit to focus on bankers’ ethics. Banks were stronger financially, but recent scandals showed that the culture of their firms still needed to improve, he observed. And if a cleanup didn’t occur, it may be a sign that they needed to be reduced in size, Mr. Dudley said in a 2014 speech that rattled Wall Street.The next big banking scandal — Wells Fargo’s widespread mistreatment of customers, which came to light in 2016 – strongly supported Mr. Dudley’s arguments. Wells Fargo was considered one of the most stable “too big to fail” banks, with its focus on plain vanilla lending, but in fact, its retail sales culture had degraded. The Fed earlier this year slapped relatively harsh sanctions on the bank, including a limit on its size.The example of Wells Fargo is pertinent for John C. Williams, a top candidate to replace Mr. Dudley. Mr. Williams is head of the San Francisco Fed, which oversees Wells Fargo.And there is still work to do to fulfill Mr. Dudley’s initiative. He proposed a “database of banker misconduct,” similar to the one for brokers, that would track a banker’s record on ethics and compliance. Banks could consult it before hiring. But this idea has not taken off. In a speech at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce on Monday, Mr. Dudley explained why: “Understandably, firms are concerned about legal risk if they share information about banker misconduct, but there may be ways to address these concerns through legislation.”Mr. Dudley had also pressed banks’ boards of directors to focus on ethical culture. On Monday, he said the boards had set up separate committees to focus on culture and conduct. “We’ve made part of the journey but I think more could be done,” Mr. Dudley said. Whether it will, depends on who steps into his shoes.— Peter EavisHow worrying is the flattening yield curve?The yield curve is near its flattest level since the financial crisis. The difference between the yields on the two-year and 10-year Treasury notes is at 0.52 percentage points, not far off its post-crisis low of 0.50 percentage points hit in January.That has some asking if the nine-year-old economic recovery is at risk.Since the end of World War II, no barometer has done a better job of predicting a recession than the yield curve. A flattening yield curve tends to indicate slowing economic growth in the near future. But what is more worrisome is if the yield curve goes beyond flattening and into outright inversion.

The chances of a recession when the yield curve is flattening is just 20 percent, according to the calculations of Jim Paulsen, the chief investment strategist at the Leuthold Group. That jumps to 72 percent when the curve inverts.“Unless the yield curve actually inverts, however, the probability of recession remains quite low. While a flatter curve may have implications for the pace of future economic growth, it does not materially raise recession risk.”There is another reason not to be too concerned about a flattening yield curve, and it has to do with the actions of central banks around the world. The unprecedented stimulus from the Fed, Bank of Japan and E.C.B. have brought down long-term rates. That means the yield curve might not be the predictor it once was.

Nvidia halts tests on self-driving cars.A week after a self-driving Uber vehicle hit and killed a woman in Arizona, the fallout continues to spread.Nvidia on Tuesday said it had suspended self-driving tests in New Jersey, Santa Clara, Japan and Germany. A Nvidia spokesperson said in a statement, using A.V. as an abbreviation for automated vehicles :“Ultimately A.V.s will be far safer than human drivers, so this important work needs to continue. We are temporarily suspending the testing of our self-driving cars on public roads to learn from the Uber incident. Our global fleet of manually driven data collection vehicles continue to operate.”Nvidia’s artificial intelligence platform is the autonomous industry’s leader. The chip maker has partnered with auto makers such as Volkswagen, Tesla and Audi. Around 320 firms - from software developers, automakers and their suppliers, sensor and mapping companies - use Nvidia’s platform, Reuters reports.Nvidia is just the latest company to halt tests on self-driving cars in the wake of the accident in Arizona. Toyota, nuTonomy and Uber have all already done so.Roger Lanctot, an automotive technology analyst with Strategy Analytics, wrote:“Nvidia has no choice but to take steps in the context of the fear, uncertainty and outrage likely to be stimulated by a robot car killing a human being. This is precisely the type of event that is capable of slaying a nascent industry in the crib.”Photo

            How else banks can limit gun salesCitigroup became the biggest Wall Street firm thus far to take actions to limit gun sales. Others, like JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Visa and Mastercard, are studying options. (Bank of America and JPMorgan are two of the bankruptcy lenders to Remington Outdoor, along with Wells Fargo, which is the N.R.A.’s bank of choice.)In his latest column, Andrew suggests these new tactics:• Credit-card issuers and banks could give gun sellers who have announced restrictions on sales, like Walmart and Dick’s Sporting Goods, a special merchant category code. That could help financial firms decide with whom they want to do business.• Payment processors could geofence gun shows and enforce restrictions on transactions coming from those GPS coordinates.

Here’s what Citi’s C.E.O., Mike Corbat, told Andrew about his firm’s actions:He said had expected to hear from customers who planned to “take their Citi card and put it in a drawer or cut it up” — and that Citi had received such responses. But ultimately “the positives have significantly outweighed the negatives,” he said. For every negative note, he said, he has gotten many more “saying that ‘I’m moving everything I have to Citi as a response to this.’”Photo

            The heat on Facebook is rising, but do shareholders care?Where to begin? The company faces inquiries from the Federal Trade Commission, the Senate Judiciary Committee, several state attorneys general and the watchdog group Common Cause. And Britain’s Parliament asked Mark Zuckerberg to testify (he’s sending a deputy).Facebook’s stock overall is headed for its worst monthly performance in nearly five years. Yet the company’s shares recovered from another beating, closing up slightly yesterday. And just two analysts have “sell” ratings on the stock, compared to 44 who have “buy” ratings.In Cambridge Analytica news: Did a Brexit campaign group violate election laws by not declaring some of its spending with AggregateIQ, a digital marketer with ties to Cambridge Analytica?Critics’ corner: Nir Kaissar of Gadfly thinks that the big question is how many users value privacy more than having a Facebook account. Charlie Warzel of BuzzFeed argues the Cambridge Analytica scandal could lead to “a full-scale personal and public reckoning that looks at the way we’ve used the internet for the last decade.”

Is Amazon behind another health care deal?Bankers and deal lawyers may want to send some of their bonus to Amazon this year. M.&A. activity is running at record levels and concerns about the e-commerce giant have played a role in driving a number of the largest deals.The latest? GlaxoSmithKline’s decision to buy out Novartis’s stake in their consumer health joint venture, which includes Sensodyne toothpaste, for $13 billion.Amazon may not have been the main reason, but its impact on the pricing of consumer health products likely played a role.Historically, such products have lower margins than prescription drugs, but customers that keep coming back. Sales, though, are slowing, up just 3 percent over the past two years, half the rate of the previous two, according to Morgan Stanley. Price competition from online retailers like Amazon has some worried it could decelerate further.

That partly helps explain why Novartis was willing to exit the business.So why was Glaxo willing to pay up for the business?1) Starting this month Novartis had the right to require Glaxo purchase its stake in the joint venture. Doing the deal now removes uncertainty.2) The deal will allow its new chief executive to “get on with fixing GSK’s pharmaceutical division, which suffers from a relatively lackluster pipeline of new drugs,” writes Neil Unmack of Breakingviews. Shares of Glaxo have gained 6.3 percent.Photo

            A reality check on the White House’s tariff tacticsThe S.&P. 500 rose 2.7 percent yesterday, its best day in nearly three years (as President Trump would be happy to tell you). Maybe it’s because, as Peter Eavis writes, the president’s threats of a trade war with China might be merely negotiating tactics.More from Peter: According to this view, the tariff proposal was a jarring move partly aimed at getting China to see that the U.S. was serious about shifting trade terms. If China doesn’t show real signs that it will do more to open its markets, Mr. Trump could up the ante — roiling the markets again. But the White House’s more conciliatory tone yesterday after last week’s sell-off suggests there is not a strong desire for a full trade war.But remember that Beijing is firmly committed to its industrial policy, while the U.S. is equally adamant about letting American companies operate more freely in China. (Even if G.M. and Ford, who have joint ventures with Chinese companies, wouldn’t benefit from a lower tariff on U.S. car imports.) And Stephen Roach of Yale thinks that the U.S.-China trade deficit will keep widening.Elsewhere in trade: The U.S. is near a deal with South Korea, after winning concessions on steel exports and imports of U.S. cars. Betting on trade wars is risky. Hedge funds are taking refuge in southern European stocks. And the Western world’s economic institutions are being attacked from within.The political flyaround• White House lawyers are examining whether more than $500 million of loans to Kushner Companies may have violated criminal laws or federal ethics regulations.

        (Reuters) - Facebook Inc is giving users more control over their privacy by making data management easier and redesigning the settings menu, the company said on Wednesday, in the wake of a scandal over a breach that exposed the personal information of millions and was allegedly used by a political consultancy.The company also said it would propose in the coming weeks updates to the social media website's terms of service and data policy to better spell out what information it collects and how it uses it.The company has faced a global outcry after a whistleblower said that data from millions of users was improperly harvested by consultancy Cambridge Analytica to target U.S. and British voters in close-run elections.Facebook shares are down nearly 18 percent since March 16, when it first acknowledged that user data had been improperly channeled to Cambridge Analytica, eating away nearly $100 billion of the company's market value.

"33","Timeline: Facebook and Google Under Regulators’ Glare","AdvertisementTechnologySupported byTimeline: Facebook and Google Under Regulators’ GlareIn 2011, the F.T.C. first required a company to create a comprehensive data privacy program for consumers. Europe will soon take another big step.ImageMark Zuckerberg, Facebook's chief executive, speaking in Barcelona, Spain, on the eve of the Mobile World Congress there last year. In May, the European Union will put into effect the General Data Protection Regulation, a comprehensive privacy law.CreditDavid Ramos/Getty ImagesBy Natasha SingerMarch 24, 2018Over the years, regulators on both sides of the Atlantic have cracked down on Facebook and Google for privacy violations. But as the European Union prepares to introduce comprehensive new data protection regulation in May, European regulators have been stepping up investigations into tech industry data practices.MARCH 2011The Federal Trade Commission for the first time requires a company to institute a comprehensive program to protect consumer data privacy Google reaches a settlement with the F.T.C., which charged the company with using deceptive tactics and violating its own privacy promises to consumers. Google had enrolled Gmail users in its social network, Buzz, without effective ways for them to opt out of the service or limit the sharing of their personal details, the agency said. NOVEMBER 2011The F.T.C. goes after Facebook for exposing users’ informationFacebook agrees to settle charges by the F.T.C. that it deceived users by telling them that they could keep their profile information private and then repeatedly allowing it to be shared and made public.AUGUST 2012 The F.T.C. fines Google $22.5 million for Safari privacy violationsGoogle agrees to pay $22.5 million to settle F.T.C. charges that the company misled people who used Apple’s Safari browser by placing advertiser tracking codes, called cookies, on their computers after Google told them that they would be opted out of such tracking. Google also violated a previous settlement that prohibited it from misleading consumers over how they could control collection of their data, the agency said.SEPTEMBER 2012Facebook turns off facial recognition in Europe after complaints that the company failed to ensure user consentAfter an audit by Ireland’s data protection commissioner, regulators report that Facebook turned off its photo-tagging facial recognition feature for new users in the European Union and will delete facial template data it had already collected from users there. The commissioner’s office said Facebook had not sufficiently notified users or obtained their explicit consent to use the feature.May 2017 The European Commission fines Facebook $122 million, saying the social network misled regulators about WhatsAppThe European Commission fines Facebook $122 million for misleading regulators during their investigation of the company’s acquisition of the WhatsApp messaging service. The commission, the executive arm of the European Union, says Facebook told regulators that it would be unable to automatically match an individual user’s Facebook account with his or her WhatsApp account. But WhatsApp later announced that it would begin sharing user data with Facebook.In December, the French Data Protection Authority orders WhatsApp to stop sharing data with Facebook or face penalties. And in March, a German court bars Facebook from using data from German users of WhatsApp for Facebook’s own purposes, upholding the ruling of a lower court.DECEMBER 2017German antitrust regulators censure Facebook’s data practicesIn a preliminary finding, Germany’s Cartel Office reports that Facebook has abused its dominant position in the country by requiring users to allow it to endlessly amass data by tracking them through other online services. In February, the regulator says it planned to investigate whether the ability of large platforms like Facebook and Google to set up closed advertising systems and have access to user data was limiting market competition.FEBRUARY 2018 A Belgian court tells Facebook to stop tracking users around the webA court in Belgium rules that Facebook must stop tracking users on third-party sites and delete the data it had already collected. The court says Facebook hadn’t sufficiently informed users about the data it gathered on their use of sites outside the social network or how it used that data.  May 2018 A sweeping data privacy law is set to take effect in Europe, reshaping data collection practices  The European Union will put into effect a comprehensive privacy law, called the General Data Protection Regulation, that requires companies to obtain consent from users before processing their data and allows the authorities to fine companies up to 4 percent of their annual revenue if they fail to comply.Natasha Singer is a business reporter covering health technology, education technology and consumer privacy.  @natashanytA version of this article appears in print on , on Page A26 of the New York edition with the headline: Feeling Regulators’ Glare  On Both Sides of the Atlantic.

        NEW YORK —  Mozilla, Tesla and other companies are distancing themselves from Facebook following revelations of a major leak of user data to political consultants associated with the 2016 Trump campaign.While the actions will not likely be permanent and won't have much of an effect on Facebook's bottom line, they're the latest fallout the social-media giant has to contend with from the ever-spiraling scandal — along with a tumbling stock price and a #deletefacebook movement.""We're taking a break from Facebook,"" Mozilla said in a blog post on Wednesday. The company, which created the Firefox web browser, said it is ""pressing pause"" on its Facebook advertising and won't be posting on its Facebook page. But it did not delete its page and said it will consider returning if Facebook takes stronger actions to protect users' data and improves privacy settings.German bank Commerzbank also said it was putting Facebook advertising ""on hold"" as it evaluates data security. And Sonos, which makes speakers and other electronics, said it is pulling advertising from Facebook, Instagram, Google, and Twitter for a week.

        While the actions are likely temporary, they're one more piece of the growing headache for Facebook since news of the leak broke a week ago. It has faced criticism because CEO Mark Zuckerberg and COO Sheryl Sandberg did not speak out until five days after the story broke. The company's stock price shed 14 percent of its value this week. And the grumblings by users, and now, businesses shows no sign of abating.

""The Cambridge Analytica scandal, like many recent headlines coming out of Silicon Valley, raises questions about whether Big Tech is doing enough to balance its own interests with one of its biggest responsibilities: safeguarding your privacy,"" Sonos wrote in a blog post.But Facebook downplayed the actions by the businesses.""Most of the businesses we've spoken with this week are pleased with the steps we've outlined to better protect people's data, and they have confidence that we'll respond to these challenges and become a better partner and company as a result,"" the company said in a statement when asked about the advertiser defection.The fact is, most advertisers need Facebook as a platform because its reach is so great, so any break is likely to only be temporary, said Allen Adamson, founder of brand-marketing consultancy Metaforce.""Companies can take a short-term hiatus to get some positive spin in the market, but there's no other alternative for digital marketing today,"" he said.

        WASHINGTON —  U.S. lawmakers on Friday formally asked Facebook Inc's Mark Zuckerberg to explain at a congressional hearing how 50 million users' data got into the hands of political consultancy Cambridge Analytica.The world's largest social media network is under growing pressure from governments, investors and advertisers. This follows allegations by a whistleblower that British political consultancy Cambridge Analytica improperly accessed users' information to build profiles on American voters that were later used to help elect U.S. President Donald Trump in 2016.""The hearing will examine the harvesting and sale of personal information from more than 50 million Facebook users, potentially without their notice or consent and in violation of Facebook policy,"" chairman Representative Greg Walden, a Republican who chairs the panel, and Frank Pallone, the top Democrat, and other committee leaders wrote in the letter.The House Energy and Commerce Committee did not say when they planned the hearing but it will not happen until Congress returns from a two-week recess.

        A Facebook spokesman confirmed the company had received the House letter and was reviewing it, but did not say whether or not Zuckerberg would agree to testify.Separately, the leaders of the U.S. Senate Commerce Committee also asked Zuckerberg to testify. Senator John Thune, the committee chairman, and Bill Nelson, the top Democrat, said the committee would work with Facebook ""to find a suitable date for Mr. Zuckerberg to testify in the coming weeks.""Facebook executives spent Wednesday and Thursday on Capitol Hill briefing congressional committee staffers.

Two senators also asked the Federal Trade Commission, the leading U.S. consumer regulator, to investigate if other firms improperly obtained user data from Facebook users. The FTC is reviewing whether Facebook violated a 2011 consent decree it reached with the authority over its privacy practices, a person briefed on the matter told Reuters this week.Zuckerberg apologized on Wednesday for the mistakes his company had made and promised to restrict developers' access to user information as part of a plan to protect privacy.His apology has failed to appease investors and advertisers.Facebook shares fell on Friday, although not at the pace of earlier in the week. After opening higher, they were down 1.6 percent at $162, and have fallen around 12 percent since last Friday. The company has lost more than $50 billion in market value since the allegations surfaced.Advertisers Mozilla and German bank Commerzbank have suspended ads on the service and the hashtag #DeleteFacebook remained popular online.On Friday, electric carmaker Tesla Inc's and its rocket company SpaceX's Facebook pages - each with more than 2.6 million followers - were deleted after Chief Executive Elon Musk promised to do so.""I didn't realize there was one. Will do,"" Musk wrote on Twitter, responding to a person urging him to delete the SpaceX page. The Tesla page was taken down shortly afterwards. ""Definitely. Looks lame anyway,"" Musk tweeted.

        SAN FRANCISCO/ FRANKFURT —  Facebook faces substantial business risks from new European Union privacy rules set to take effect in May, a looming reality that came into stark relief over the weekend with revelations that a controversial political consulting firm had improperly obtained personal data on 50 million Facebook users.Privacy experts said the disclosure that a researcher had  sold Facebook data collected via a personality quiz to the consulting firm Cambridge Analytica is a prime example of the kinds of practices that the new General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, is supposed to prevent or punish.The danger faced by Facebook going forward is two-fold: Complying with the rules means letting European users opt out of the highly targeted online ads that have made Facebook a money machine. Violating GDPR mandates could subject the California company to fines of up to 4 percent of annual revenues.Had the Cambridge Analytica incident happened after GDPR becomes law on May 25, it ""would have cost Facebook 4 percent of their global revenue"", said Austrian privacy campaigner and Facebook critic Max Schrems. Because a UK company was involved and because at least some of the people whose data was misused were almost certainly European, GDPR would have applied.

        Schrems first raised concerns in 2011 about how easy it would be for third-party apps to harvest data from the unwitting friends of Facebook users. Facebook says it has tightened its controls on such practices since it discovered the alleged abuses by Cambridge Analytica in 2015.Schrems has founded a non-profit, called None Of Your Business (NOYB), that is hiring lawyers and exploring avenues for ""strategic litigation"" over GDPR privacy violations.According to whistleblower Christopher Wylie, who formerly worked with Cambridge Analytica, the consulting firm used the data to help then-U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump to predict and influence choices at the ballot box.“The fact of the matter is that Facebook lost control of the data and wasn't adequately monitoring what third-parties were doing,"" said Scott Vernick, a partner and an expert in privacy and data security at the Philadelphia law firm Fox Rothschild.Vernick said the maximum GDPR fine could come into play in an incident like this because of the number of users affected and what appears to have been inadequate monitoring of third-party data practices.Facebook said it changed its policies in 2014 to ""to give much less data, especially about friends,"" Facebook Vice President Andrew Bosworth said in a Facebook post on Monday.""We conduct a robust review to identify potential policy violations and to assess whether the app has a legitimate use for the data,"" the company said on Monday. ""We actually reject a significant number of apps through this process.”

Compliance with GDPR rules could cost Facebook a significant amount of money. Deutsche Bank analysts in January estimated that Facebook’s overall revenue could be lowered by 4 percent in a scenario in which 30 percent of EU users opt out of targeted ads, reducing the effectiveness and likely price of ads shown by 50 percent.The EU represents 24 percent of Facebook's ad revenue, so multiplying those figures, the bank said the regulations could have a 4 percent impact on overall Facebook revenue.""If this regulatory approach spreads to other countries or if GDPR ever becomes more onerous over the medium or long term, it would pose more risk,"" Deutsche Bank warned.The firestorm over Cambridge Analytica has prompted a furious response from lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic, raising the prospect of just such an expansion of privacy protections.

Pivotal Research analyst Brian Wieser reiterated his 'sell' rating on Facebook after the weekend reports. Wieser expressed concerns that the company's regulatory risks would intensify and that its sophisticated use of data in advertising was in jeopardy.A December 2017 survey found that only 21 percent of European consumers know what GDPR is. But after the regulation was explained, 82 percent of respondents said they plan to exercise their new rights, according to the survey of 7,000 Europeans conducted by Cambridge, Mass.-based Pegasystems Inc, which makes sales and marketing software.PageFair, an Irish startup that helps websites deliver targeted ads without using personal data, estimates that only 3 percent of European social media users will opt-in to targeted ads, a potentially ""devastating"" blow for Facebook and other platforms, says Johnny Ryan, PageFair's head of ecosystem.GIVING CONSUMERS CONTROLThe quandary for Facebook is readily apparent from a video it began showing customers in February: it teaches people how to delete their accounts.GDPR gives users the right to access their data, delete it or transfer it to competing companies. Social networks will also need to regain Europeans' consent every time they want to use their data in new ways, including for targeted advertising.

Lawmakers had social networks in mind when drafting GDPR, said Helen Dixon, the data protection commissioner of Ireland, which is the lead GDPR regulator for numerous tech companies including Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn.""There was very big consideration of these newer types of platforms,"" she told Reuters.Tough European rules stand in sharp contrast to the lack of privacy regulation in the United States and many other countries, raising the prospect that Facebook will begin to look much different from one country to the next.For example, the social media giant in 2017 released new artificial intelligence features that detect when a user is at risk of suicide or when someone else uploads a picture of their face.The company did not make those features available in Europe. Facebook did not specify a reason. But heightened scrutiny in Europe over such practices with GDPR looming may have been a factor.Another challenge for social networks are GDPR provisions mandating how companies must obtain permissions. The regulation demands that requests for consent be presented ""in an intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language.""In other words, the days of extensive ""terms of service"" agreements written in small text will no longer pass muster in Europe, numerous data privacy lawyers told Reuters.In practice, social network users may find themselves seeing more ""permissions screens"" and being asked to check boxes every time a social network rolls out a new feature.That could depress usage, Facebook Chief Financial Officer David Wehner said at an investor conference last month.    ""Whenever you walk people through permission screens, there's some potential that people decide they're not going to use the product,"" Wehner said. ""We don't think it will be big, but there could be some implication there.""(This version of the story was refiled to correct description of PageFair's business in 19th paragraph)(Additional reporting by Foo Yun Chee in Brussels, and Paul Sandle and Eric Auchard in London; Editing by Jonathan Weber and Marla Dickerson)        Continue reading the main story

        Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa says the April 10 hearing will cover how consumer data is collected, retained and distributed for commercial use. He says the hearing also will examine what steps companies like Facebook can do to better protect personal information.Grassley's committee is the third congressional panel to seek Zuckerberg's testimony in the wake of a privacy scandal involving Cambridge Analytica, a Trump-connected data-mining company.Several Judiciary Committee members had pressed Grassley to hold the hearing.Grassley says he's also invited Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey.___12:15 p.m.The chief law enforcement officers for 37 U.S. states and territories are demanding to know when Facebook learned of a huge breach of privacy protections.The officers say in a letter Monday to CEO Mark Zuckerberg that users' trust in the social media platform is ""broken.""The attorneys general are asking how Facebook monitored what these developers did with all the data they collected and whether Facebook had safeguards to prevent misuse.They also asked Zuckerberg for an update on how Facebook will allow users to more easily control the privacy of their accounts.

___11:55 a.m.Germany's justice minister says she wants closer oversight of companies such as Facebook, following a meeting with executives about the abuse of users' private data.Katarina Barley says Facebook representatives assured her Monday that such breaches wouldn't occur again and pledged to inform those users who were affected.She added that ""promises aren't enough, though. We will need to monitor companies such as Facebook much more strictly in future and also punish breaches of data protection strongly, swiftly and painfully.""Barley said Facebook reacted ""favorably"" to her demand for greater transparency about the algorithms that underpin the company's data collection.She said campaigns such as ""Delete Facebook"" would likely make a strong impression on the company because ""in the end the currency that Facebook works with is trust.""___10:50 a.m.The Federal Trade Commission is investigating Facebook's privacy practices following a week of privacy scandals including whether the company engaged in ""unfair acts"" that cause ""substantial injury"" to consumers.Facebook's stock, which already took a big hit last week, plunged as a result.Facebook said in a statement on Monday that the company remains ""strongly committed"" to protecting people's information and that it welcomes the opportunity to answer the FTC's questions.News outlets have reported on the FTC investigation last week, but the FTC hadn't confirmed it until Monday. Facebook reached a settlement with the FTC in 2011 offering privacy assurances.___5 a.m.Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is promising to do a better job protecting user data following reports that a political consultant misused the personal information of millions of the company's subscribers. The fact is, European regulators are already forcing him to do so.

A similar data breach in the future could make Facebook liable for fines of more than $1.6 billion under the European Union's new General Data Protection Regulation, which will be enforced from May 25. The rules, approved two years ago, also make it easier for consumers to give and withdraw consent for the use of their data and apply to any company that uses the data of EU residents, no matter where it is based.

        NEW YORK —  To get an idea of the data Facebook collects about you, just ask for it. You'll get a file with every photo and comment you've posted, all the ads you've clicked on, stuff you've liked and searched for and everyone you've friended — and unfriended — over the years.Now, the company is under fire for collecting data on people's phone calls and text messages if they used Android devices. While Facebook insists users had to specifically agree, or opt in, to have such data collected, at least some users appeared surprised.Facebook's trove of data is used to decide which ads to show you. It also makes using Facebook more seamless and enjoyable — say, by determining which posts to emphasize in your feed, or reminding you of friends' birthdays.Facebook claims to protect all this information, and it lays out its terms in a privacy policy that's relatively clear and concise. But few users bother to read it. You might be surprised at what Facebook's privacy policy allows — and what's left unsaid.

Facebook's privacy practices have come under fire after a Trump-affiliated political consulting firm, Cambridge Analytica, got data inappropriately from millions of Facebook users. While past privacy debacles have centered on what marketers gather on users, the stakes are higher this time because the firm is alleged to have created psychological profiles to influence how people vote or even think about politics and society.

        Facebook defends its data collection and sharing activities by noting that it's adhering to a privacy policy it shares with users. Thanks largely to years of privacy scandals and pressure from users and regulators, Facebook also offers a complex set of controls that let users limit how their information is used — to a point.You can turn off ad targeting and see generic ads instead, the way you would on television or in a newspaper. In the ad settings, you'd need to uncheck all your interests, interactions with companies and websites and other personal information you don't want to use in targeting. Of course, if you click on a new interest after this, you'll have to go back and uncheck it in your ad preferences to prevent targeting. It's a tedious task.As Facebook explains, it puts you in target categories based on your activity. So, if you are 35, live in Seattle and have liked an outdoor adventure page, Facebook may show you an ad for a mountain bike shop in your area.But activity isn't limited to pages or posts you like, comments you make and your use of outside apps and websites.

""If you start typing something and change your mind and delete it, Facebook keeps those and analyzes them too,"" Zeynep Tufekci, a prominent techno-sociologist, said in a 2017 TED talk.And, increasingly, Facebook tries to match what it knows about you with your offline data, purchased from data brokers or gathered in other ways. The more information it has, the fuller the picture of you it can offer to advertisers. It can infer things about you that you had no intention of sharing — anything from your ethnicity to personality traits, happiness and use of addictive substances, Tufekci said.These types of data collection aren't necessarily explicit in privacy policies or settings.What Facebook does say is that advertisers don't get the raw data. They just tell Facebook what kind of people they want their ads to reach, then Facebook makes the matches and shows the ads.Apps can also collect a lot of data about you, as revealed in the Cambridge Analytica scandal. The firm got the data from a researcher who paid 270,000 Facebook users to complete a psychological profile quiz back in 2014. But the quiz gathered information on their friends as well, bringing the total number of people affected to about 50 million.

Facebook says Cambridge Analytica got the data inappropriately — but only because the app said it collected data for research rather than political profiling. Gathering data on friends was permitted at the time, even if they had never installed the app or given explicit consent.Ian Bogost, a Georgia Tech communications professor who built a tongue-in-cheek game called ""Cow Clicker"" in 2010, wrote in The Atlantic recently that abusing the Facebook platform for ""deliberately nefarious ends"" was easy to do then. What's worse, he said, it was hard to avoid extracting private data.If ""you played Cow Clicker, even just once, I got enough of your personal data that, for years, I could have assembled a reasonably sophisticated profile of your interests and behavior,"" he wrote. ""I might still be able to; all the data is still there, stored on my private server, where Cow Clicker is still running, allowing players to keep clicking where a cow once stood.""Facebook has since restricted the amount of types of data apps can access. But other types of data collection are still permitted. For this reason, it's a good idea to check all the apps you've given permissions to over the years. You can also do this in your settings.        Continue reading the main story

The Reader Center is one way we in the newsroom are trying to connect with you, by highlighting your perspectives and experiences and offering insight into how we work.Last weekend, Alyssa Severson, a member of our Reader Center Facebook Group, posed a question to her fellow group members: “Are you emotionally affected by the news? Sometimes reading about politics, human rights infringements, war zones, etc. can make me feel anxious or hopeless in a big way. What are some coping strategies you employ?”Coincidentally, a story published the same day profiled an Ohio man who has unplugged from news media entirely and describes himself as “bored” yet happy. But our roundup of reactions to the story suggested many readers don’t consider such a drastic solution acceptable.What’s the alternative? Reader Center Facebook Group members shared a mélange of ideas for keeping news-generated stress at bay. After you read them, tell us some of the ways you tackle this kind of anxiety.

Comments below have been condensed and edited for clarity.Alyssa Severson (Thailand): Sometimes I’ll put a moratorium on a certain subject if it’s bringing up really negative feelings. (Right now, no Myanmar ethnic cleansing articles!) Sometimes realizing how many things are wrong with the world gives me a serious existential crisis, but I think that’s just part of life when you care about others.

        Abby Leafe (Newtown, Pa.): How do I cope? I detach. And I remind myself that it’s a long game. Plus, I’m running for office!Stacie Birchett (Richmond, Va.): Outlander reruns.Marjie Gowdy (Callaway, Va.): I’ve watched La La Land more times than I can count.Jeffrey Itell (Vietnam): I read the news in the context that good “news” is happening always. I read The Times to find out when Mount Agung is spewing lava ... and not for the magnificent view it provides from Gili Trawangan. The Times reports the news, which includes important events I want to know about. But it doesn’t provide me a complete snapshot of the world.Shasta Gaughen (Escondido, Ca.): When it gets to be too much, I’ll delete my sources without reading and take a timeout. Cats help. And ice cream. Lots of ice cream. Here’s one of my cats encouraging me to take a break.Photo

            Elaine Tanzman: Sometimes reading disturbing news will inspire me to contribute to organizations that I have forgotten about. For example, after reading about the Neo Nazi riots in Charlottesville, I donated to the Southern Poverty Law Center.Daniel Mainz (Brooklyn, NY): I’ve appreciated a couple of news sources that combine research and commentary with practical, actionable steps readers can take to make their voices heard. They are DCReport.org from Pulitzer winner David Cay Johnston and Lauren Duca’s columns in Teen Vogue. Yes, I admit it. Teen Vogue: I read it for the politics.Deb Amlen (New York Times crossword columnist): I do regular news fasts and have tried not to wallow on places like Twitter. Also, did you know that the crossword puzzle was originally run in newspapers as an escape from the news pages during World War II? It still allows readers to keep their brains sharp and talk about something other than world events.

Anna Núñez (Houston, Texas): Dealing with daily barbaric immigration news is part of my job (copywriter for America’s Voice). At the end of the day, baking and cooking soothes me and I was grateful for this recent NYT recipe that I highly recommend to calm you, too!Photo
    
            
    Fadi BouKaram (Lebanon): Thankfully, I’ve been reading Reader’s Digest since I was a kid. It might be perceived as cheesy, but the “positive news” in it is a good reminder that the frequency of what’s covered by media does not reflect the reality of how the world is.Deborah Suraya (New York City): Having dinner together with friends really helps because there is usually a lot of laughter, chatter, etc. I also follow comedians on Twitter/Instagram, not just pure news outlets.

Julia Lansford (from Russia; living in NYC): World can seem a horrible place at a glance. However, NYT has a great project: The Week in Good News. When down from all the negativity, I also remember that dialogue between Frodo and Sam Gamgee in Peter Jackson’s “The Lord of the Rings”:FRODO: What are we holding on to, Sam?SAM: That there’s some good in this world, Mr. Frodo. And it’s worth fighting for.Alexandra Velasco (Queens, NY): I’m a democrat and, at the time, I couldn’t understand why anyone would vote for Trump. But since he got elected, I’ve been fascinated by reasons why people voted for him, and have been trying to find some understanding in their reasoning. Trying to understand people with different viewpoints has helped me cope.

I don’t need to tell you that something is wrong with social media.You’ve probably experienced it yourself. Maybe it’s the way you feel while scrolling through your Twitter feed — anxious, twitchy, a little world weary — or your unease when you see a child watching YouTube videos, knowing she’s just a few algorithmic nudges away from a rabbit hole filled with lunatic conspiracies and gore. Or maybe it was this month’s Facebook privacy scandal, which reminded you that you’ve entrusted the most intimate parts of your digital life to a profit-maximizing surveillance machine.Our growing discomfort with our largest social platforms is reflected in polls. One recently conducted by Axios and SurveyMonkey found that all three of the major social media companies — Facebook, Twitter and Google, which shares a parent company with YouTube — are significantly less popular with Americans than they were five months ago. (And Americans might be the lucky ones. Outside the United States, social media is fueling real-world violence and empowering autocrats, often with much less oversight.)But it would be a mistake to throw up our hands and assume that it has to be this way. The original dream of social media — producing healthy discussions, unlocking new forms of creativity, connecting people to others with similar interests — shouldn’t be discarded because of the failures of the current market leaders. And lots of important things still happen on even the most flawed networks. The West Virginia teachers’ strike and last weekend’s March for Our Lives, for example, were largely organized on Facebook and Twitter.The primary problem with today’s social networks is that they’re already too big, and are trapped inside a market-based system that forces them to keep growing. Facebook can’t stop monetizing our personal data for the same reason that Starbucks can’t stop selling coffee — it’s the heart of the enterprise.

Many of the fixes being proposed involve regulation. The Honest Ads Act, a bill in the Senate, would require greater transparency for online political ads. The European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation, which goes into effect in May, aims to give users greater control of their digital information trails.

        But these efforts don’t touch the underlying problems, and in fact could make it harder for start-ups to compete with the giants.If we’re really serious about changing how social networks operate, far more radical interventions are required. Here are three possible ways to rescue social media from the market-based pressures that got us here.Give Power to the PeopleIn their book “New Power,” which comes out next week, Jeremy Heimans and Henry Timms write about the struggle between centralized, top-down institutions, which represent “old power,” and decentralized, bottom-up movements, which represent “new power.”Facebook, they write, is an example of a new power institution that serves old power interests. It harvests the creative output of billions of people and turns it into a giant, centralized enterprise, with most users sharing none of the economic value they create and getting no say in the platform’s governance.Instead, the authors ask, what if a social network was truly run by its users?“If you’re contributing economic value to something of this much social consequence, you should share in the value you’re creating,” Mr. Heimans told me.Nathan Schneider, a professor of media studies at the University of Colorado, had a similar idea in 2016, when he proposed that Twitter users band together to buy the platform from its shareholders and convert it into a user-run collective, similar to the way a local credit union is run. People who made valuable contributions to the network, such as employees and power users, would receive bigger stakes and more voting power. And users would have a seat at the table for major decisions about the platform’s operations.It’s exceedingly unlikely that Mark Zuckerberg, who has fought hard to keep control of Facebook, will ever convert the company into a user-owned and run collective. But Mr. Schneider believes that giving more control to responsible users could help restore trust in the network, and signal the kind of values Mr. Zuckerberg says he wants Facebook to represent.

“He could show that he takes democracy seriously enough to start with his own baby,” Mr. Schneider said.

Create a Social FederationAnother radical approach would be to make social networks work more like email — so that independent apps could seamlessly work together with one another, across a common protocol.Instead of one big Facebook, a federated social network would look like clusters of independent nodes — Mombook and Athletebook and Gamerbook — all of which could be plugged into the umbrella network when it made sense. Rather than requiring a one-size-fits-all set of policies that apply to billions of users, these nodes could be designed to reflect users’ priorities. (A network for privacy hawks and one for open-sharing maximalists could have different data-retention rules, and a network for L.G.B.T. users and one for evangelical pastors could have different hate speech rules.) If a node became too toxic, it could be removed without shutting down the entire network.“Email is the most resilient social network on the internet,” Mr. Schneider said, “and the thing that allows it to adapt is that it’s an open protocol, and people build apps on top of it, and we evolve how we use it.”Versions of this kind of network already exist. Mastodon, a decentralized Twitter-like social network, has gotten more than a million registered users since its debut in 2016. And various social networks based on the blockchain — the ledger system that underlies virtual currencies like Bitcoin — have sprung up in recent months.To be sure, decentralized networks have their own problems. They’re messy to administer, and they can still be gamed by bad actors. They can also fall prey to the same kind of privacy issues that Facebook is being criticized for. (In fact, part of the reason users are angry at Facebook right now is that the company’s data infrastructure was too open, and made it overly simple for third-party app developers to take user information outside Facebook.)None of this is a panacea. But experimenting with more decentralized models could give social media users a sense that platforms represented their interests, rather than those of a faceless corporation.Put Expiration Dates on Social GraphsA single friend of mine once remarked that the major difference among dating apps like OKCupid, Tinder and Bumble wasn’t the way they were designed or the companies behind them — it was how long they had existed.

New apps, she said, were more likely to attract interesting and smart people who were actually looking for dates. Older apps, by contrast, were eventually overrun with creeps and predators, no matter how well built they were.A similar theory might apply to social networks. Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Instagram and Snapchat all had plenty of issues in their early years, but they were by and large cleaner, with fewer types of exploitation and malicious behavior. Today, the enormous size and influence of these platforms have made them irresistible honey pots for bad actors, and many of our “social graphs” — Facebook’s term for the webs of digital connections we create — are clogged with years’ worth of clutter.In a blog post last year, the venture capitalist Hunter Walk proposed an interesting idea: a legally mandated “start over” button that, when pressed, would allow users of social networks to delete all their data, clear out their feeds and friend lists, and begin with a fresh account.

I’d go even further, and suggest that social networks give their users an automatic “self-cleaning” option, which would regularly clear their profiles of apps they no longer used, friendships and followers they no longer interacted with, and data they no longer needed to store. If these tools were enabled, users would need to take affirmative action if they didn’t want their information to disappear after a certain number of months or years.Making social graphs temporary, rather than preserving them forever by default, would undoubtedly be bad for most social networks’ business models. But it could create new and healthy norms around privacy and data hygiene, and it would keep problems from piling up as networks get older and more crowded. It might even recapture some of the magic of the original social networks, when things were fresh and fascinating, and not quite so scary.
    
         Correction: March 29, 2018  An earlier version of this article misstated the number of registered users on Mastodon. It is more than a million, not more than 140,000.

A parade of regulators, politicians and law enforcement officials demanded to know more about Facebook’s privacy practices on Monday, as the fallout from the company’s relationship with a political data firm continued to spread.Early in the day, the Federal Trade Commission confirmed reports that it was investigating how Facebook handles information about its users.Soon after, Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa and chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, invited Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, to testify about privacy standards next month. He also extended invitations to Google’s chief executive, Sundar Pichai, and Twitter’s chief executive, Jack Dorsey.And a group of 37 attorneys general sent Mr. Zuckerberg a letter asking for details about Facebook’s privacy safeguards.

But one group of people interested in Facebook — investors — had a muted reaction to the growing regulatory threat. Shares of Facebook fell sharply after the F.T.C. confirmed its investigation but ended the day up 0.4 percent as overall trading on Wall Street recovered from a big drop last week.

        The federal investigation and threats followed recent news that the data collection firm Cambridge Analytica, which worked on the 2016 Trump presidential campaign, gained access to the personal data of more than 50 million Facebook users.The F.T.C. said it planned to determine whether the social media giant had violated a consent decree it signed in 2011 to protect users’ privacy.The decree required Facebook to notify and receive explicit permission from users before sharing their personal information beyond the limits dictated by their privacy settings. Each violation of the agreement, which the agency reached with Facebook as part of a settlement over third-party apps, carries a penalty of up to $40,000 a day.The agency’s acknowledgment of its investigation helped push Facebook’s stock down as much as 6.5 percent on Monday morning before it recovered. Facebook said last week that it was anticipating an inquiry by the agency.The F.T.C. said in a statement on Monday that it “takes very seriously recent press reports raising substantial concerns about the privacy practices of Facebook.”Lawmakers have repeatedly called for Mr. Zuckerberg to appear in hearings on Capitol Hill. Last week, the Republican and Democratic leaders of the House and Senate commerce committees formally invited him to testify.“I’m sure this is much bigger than Cambridge Analytica, and I’m sure there are other Cambridge Analyticas out there,” Senator John Kennedy, Republican from Louisiana, said in an interview. “Facebook isn’t just a company. It is so powerful it is like a country.”

Some lawmakers, such as Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat from Connecticut, asked the F.T.C. to look into whether Facebook should pay damages to users.“The sphere of scrutiny must be broader than just the consent decree,” he said in a statement. “There is no excuse for delay.”

Cambridge Analytica is facing intense criticism, too. On Monday, Common Cause, a government watchdog group in Washington, filed complaints seeking federal investigations into allegations that the company violated federal election law.In an article that detailed how Cambridge Analytica obtained information about millions of Facebook users, The New York Times reported this month that employees of the data research firm with European or Canadian citizenship had worked extensively for its American clients during the 2014 and 2016 elections, despite a warning from its own election lawyer.The employees worked on polling, message development, and the designing of target audiences for digital ads and fund-raising appeals.The company said the work was permissible because none of the foreign employees had “strategic” or “operational” roles. But former employees contradicted that account, suggesting that the work violated laws in the United States that strictly limit what non-Americans can do for American political campaigns.Common Cause filed one complaint with the Justice Department, which has authority to investigate “knowing and willful” violations of campaign law. The group also filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission, which has day-to-day jurisdiction over enforcing election rules.“It defies belief that even after their own attorney warned them that they would be violating the prohibition on performing certain election-related activities in U.S. elections that they did so anyway,” said Paul S. Ryan, Common Cause’s vice president for policy and litigation.In the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco, lawyers appealed two lawsuits that challenged the social media company’s privacy and user data policies. One lawsuit claims that Facebook violates the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (Wiretap Act) and state law equivalents because of the way it monitors its users on and off the platform.

The second suit claims that Facebook has been capturing and selling the details of users’ browsing of third-party health sites. Any site with a Facebook “like” button, including those of medical institutions such as the American Cancer Society and the American Society of Clinical Oncology, could be used to track users as they browsed outside Facebook, according to the lawsuit.Facebook also has been targeted by several shareholder lawsuits since the reports detailing Cambridge Analytica’s use of Facebook user information.Video


    
    Why Leaving Facebook Doesn’t Always Mean Quitting

        
            
                In the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, in which data from over 50 million Facebook profiles was secretly scraped and mined for voter insights, many Facebook users have decided to delete their accounts — but untangling yourself from a site like Facebook is not as easy as pressing “delete.”

    Many users have threatened to deactivate or delete their accounts to protest Facebook’s stewardship of their personal data. The #deletefacebook campaign, as it has been called, has even received support from a creator of WhatsApp, one of Facebook’s most popular services, who sold his company to the social media giant for $19 billion in 2014. Elon Musk, the chief executive of SpaceX and Tesla, removed the Facebook pages of both companies on Friday.While the Cambridge Analytica revelations have renewed regulatory interest in Facebook in the United States, pressure on the company in other countries has been building for years.The company has been the subject of several privacy investigations and charges by European regulators. And Europe has approved a new privacy law, which takes effect in May, that will give users of Facebook, Google and other internet services more control over how their data is collected and what Silicon Valley companies know about them.

 (Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.)Good morning.Here’s what you need to know:Facebook’s “trust issue”• Mark Zuckerberg, the social media giant’s chief executive, publicly addressed the crisis facing his company, five days after reports about the misuse of data from 50 million of its users.“We also made mistakes, there’s more to do, and we need to step up and do it,” he wrote in a statement outlining the steps Facebook would take to better protect users’ information. He also spoke to The Times about his plans for change.Given that the gathering of user data is fundamental to the company’s operations, lawmakers and researchers were unimpressed by Mr. Zuckerberg’s mea culpa: “He avoided the big issue, which is that for many years, Facebook was basically giving away user data like it was handing out candy,” a Columbia University researcher said.• Disillusioned Facebook users  have been leaving the service.

            Trump takes on China• President Trump has said the country is an “economic enemy” of the U.S. that has “taken advantage of us like nobody in history.”Today, he plans to announce tariffs on at least $50 billion of annual Chinese imports and to impose other penalties in response to the theft of technology and trade secrets. Previously announced tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, which will also affect China, go into effect on Friday.China’s staggering economic growth has indeed been propelled by unfair trade practices, but experts worry that the president’s go-it-alone approach undermines the potential for collective action.• On Wednesday, Mr. Trump appeared to endorse a $1.3 trillion spending deal reached by Congress. Lawmakers must approve the bill by midnight Friday to avoid a government shutdown. Trump lawyer for Russia inquiry resigns• President’s Trump’s lead lawyer for the special counsel investigation resigned today, according to two people briefed on the matter.The lawyer, John Dowd, who took over the president’s legal team last summer, had considered leaving several times and ultimately concluded that Mr. Trump was increasingly ignoring his advice, one of the people said.

• The president has said that he would agree to an interview with the office of the special counsel, Robert Mueller, but Mr. Dowd has said that was a bad idea.F.B.I. investigated Sessions• At the request of Congress, the bureau investigated Attorney General Jeff Sessions for possible perjury last year, after he inaccurately said that he had no contacts with Russians during the presidential campaign, according to three people familiar with the case.Andrew McCabe, the F.B.I.’s deputy director at the time, was said to have authorized the inquiry. Mr. McCabe was recently fired — by Mr. Sessions — for showing “lack of candor” in an internal investigation.• Separately, John Brennan, a former C.I.A. director and a pointed critic of President Trump, said that he thought Russia may have compromising information on the president. He later said that his opinion wasn’t based on inside knowledge.

Justice William Brennan held that the law violated the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment because it discriminated between married and unmarried people.The case became an important precedent for landmark rulings by the Supreme Court, including the 1973 decision in Roe v. Wade that recognized abortion rights, and, more recently, the 2015 decision guaranteeing a right to same-sex marriage.A movie about Mr. Baird’s case is in development.Mr. Baird has continued working as an activist, but his legacy is complicated by what The Times described in 1993 as an “unapologetic zealotry” and a willingness to criticize “even his ideologic allies.” Planned Parenthood once called him an “embarrassment.”Jillian Rayfield contributed reporting._____Your Morning Briefing is published weekdays and updated all morning.

        NEW YORK —  In the wake of a privacy scandal involving a Trump-connected data-mining firm, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg embarked on a rare media mini-blitz in an attempt to take some of the public and political pressure off the social network.But it's far from clear whether he's won over U.S. and European authorities, much less the broader public whose status updates provide Facebook with an endless stream of data it uses to sell targeted ads.On Wednesday, the generally reclusive Zuckerberg sat for an interview on CNN and conducted several more with other outlets, addressing reports that Cambridge Analytica purloined the data of more than 50 million Facebook users in order to sway elections. The Trump campaign paid the firm $6 million during the 2016 election, although it has since distanced itself from Cambridge.Zuckerberg apologized for a ""major breach of trust,"" admitted mistakes and outlined steps to protect users following Cambridge's data grab.

""I am really sorry that happened,"" Zuckerberg said on CNN. Facebook has a ""responsibility"" to protect its users' data, he added, noting that if it fails, ""we don't deserve to have the opportunity to serve people.""        Continue reading the main story

        His mea culpa on cable television came a few hours after he acknowledged his company's mistakes in a Facebook post , but without saying he was sorry.Zuckerberg and Facebook's No. 2 executive, Sheryl Sandberg, had been quiet since news broke Friday that Cambridge may have used data improperly obtained from roughly 50 million Facebook users to try to sway elections. Cambridge's clients included Donald Trump's general-election campaign.Facebook shares have dropped some 8 percent, lopping about $46 billion off the company's market value, since the revelations were first published.While several experts said Zuckerberg took an important step with the CNN interview, few were convinced that he put the Cambridge issue behind hm. Zuckerberg's apology, for instance, seemed rushed and pro forma to Helio Fred Garcia, a crisis-management professor at NYU and Columbia University.""He didn't acknowledge the harm or potential harm to the affected users,"" Garcia said. ""I doubt most people realized he was apologizing.""Instead, the Facebook chief pointed to steps the company has already taken, such as a 2014 move to restrict the access outside apps had to user data. (That move came too late to stop Cambridge.) And he laid out a series of technical changes that will further limit the data such apps can collect, pledged to notify users when outsiders misuse their information and said Facebook will ""audit"" apps that exhibit troubling behavior.That audit will be a giant undertaking, said David Carroll, a media researcher at the Parsons School of Design in New York — one that he said will likely turn up a vast number of apps that did ""troubling, distressing things.""

But on other fronts, Zuckerberg carefully hedged otherwise striking remarks.In the CNN interview, for instance, he said he would be ""happy"" to testify before Congress — but only if it was ""the right thing to do."" Zuckerberg went on to note that many other Facebook officials might be more appropriate witnesses depending on what Congress wanted to know.

At another point, the Facebook chief seemed to favor regulation for Facebook and other internet giants. At least, that is, the ""right"" kind of rules, such as ones requiring online political ads to disclose who paid for them. In almost the next breath, however, Zuckerberg steered clear of endorsing a bill that would write such rules into federal law, and instead talked up Facebook's own voluntary efforts on that front.""They'll fight tooth and nail to fight being regulated,"" said Timothy Carone, a Notre Dame business professor. ""In six months we'll be having the same conversations, and it's just going to get worse going into the election.""Even Facebook's plan to let users know about data leaks may put the onus on users to educate themselves. Zuckerberg said Facebook will ""build a tool"" that lets users see if their information had been impacted by the Cambridge leak, suggesting that the company won't be notifying people automatically. Facebook took this kind of do-it-yourself approach in the case of Russian election meddling, in contrast to Twitter, which notified users who had been exposed to Russian propaganda on its network.In what has become one of the worst backlashes Facebook has ever seen, politicians in the U.S. and Britain have called for Zuckerberg to explain its data practices in detail. State attorneys general in Massachusetts, New York and New Jersey have opened investigations into the Cambridge mess. And some have rallied to a movement that urges people to delete their Facebook accounts entirely.Sandy Parakilas, who worked in data protection for Facebook in 2011 and 2012, told a U.K. parliamentary committee Wednesday that the company was vigilant about its network security but lax when it came to protecting users' data.He said personal data including email addresses and in some cases private messages was allowed to leave Facebook servers with no real controls on how the data was used after that.Paul Argenti, a business professor at Dartmouth, said that while Zuckerberg's comments hit the right notes, they still probably aren't enough. ""The question is, can you really trust Facebook,"" he said. ""I don't think that question has been answered.""Cambridge Analytica headquarters in central London was briefly evacuated Thursday as a precaution after a suspicious package was received. Nothing dangerous was found and normal business resumed, police said.___AP reporters Danica Kirka and Gregory Katz in London and Michael Liedtke in San Francisco contributed to this story.

        NEW YORK —  After a jittery afternoon of trading, major U.S. stock indexes fell Wednesday while smaller companies fared better. The Federal Reserve raised interest rates, as investors expected, and said it could raise rates at a quicker pace next year.Stocks traded higher early in the day and jumped after the Fed announced its decision. The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 250 points, but gave it all up as new Fed Chairman Jerome Powell addressed reporters. At the end of trading it wobbled and ended lower. The dollar weakened and bond yields turned lower. Yields had risen earlier in the afternoon.The Fed said the U.S. economy and the job market continued to improve over the last two months. It still expects to raise interest rates three times this year, and said it might raise rates three more times next year instead of two.Brent Schutte, the chief investment strategist for Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management, said Powell is trying to tell Wall Street what the Fed's plans are without worrying investors too much. He said stocks dropped after Powell said rates might rise higher than the Fed expects.

""The market will have to get to know Jerome Powell a little bit and will have to test his credibility as Fed chairman,"" he said. ""I would imagine the bar is higher for him in the shorter term because he is not a trained economist,"" unlike Janet Yellen and other predecessors.

        Small and mid-size companies climbed. Energy companies led the way as oil prices jumped for the second day in a row. Homebuilders advanced following a report that sales of previously occupied homes increased in February. Cereal and packaged foods companies slumped after General Mills reported rising expenses and cut its annual profit forecast and airlines skidded after Southwest said its revenue is suffering as it cuts fares to compete with other companies.The S&P 500 index slid 5.01 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,711.93. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 44.96 points, or 0.2 percent, to 24,682.31. The Nasdaq composite fell 19.02 points, or 0.3 percent, to 7,345.29. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies gained 8.90 points, or 0.6 percent, to 1,579.30.Bond prices edged lower. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note declined to 2.88 percent from 2.90 percent Tuesday. It had risen as high as 2.93 percent as investors expected quicker gains in interest rates.David Kelly, the chief global strategist for JPMorgan Asset Management, said stocks usually do well when rates are rising, but only up to a point.""If interest rates are rising from a low level, there's more optimism about the economy, and that generally is a more positive thing,"" he said. That's the case right now, but with an important difference: the economy has been growing for almost a decade, and interest rates have been historically low for the whole time.Kelly added that the Fed and the government need to be careful to focus on smooth growth, as the recent tax cuts will dump some short-lived stimulus into the economy.""The overall effect of the tax cut is to deliver another keg to a keg party at 2 a.m.,"" he said. ""The party is probably going to go a little longer but the hangover is going to be worse.""

Good morning.(Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.)More than 10 years ago, Arnold Schwarzenegger, then the Republican governor of California, told an audience of conservative leaders that the California Republican Party had moved too far to the right and was “dying at the box office.”“How right I was,” Mr. Schwarzenegger said in a rare return public appearance on Wednesday. “The party was going down and down and down. Today we are the Titanic after it hit the iceberg — but before the last bit of the ship submerged.”Mr. Schwarzenegger was speaking at a youth center in East Los Angeles marking the start of an organization of moderate California Republicans trying to move the way-out-of-power state party to the center — and back, organizers said, into being a player in state governance. The organization is called New Way California and was put together by Assemblyman Chad Mayes, who was ousted as the Republican minority leader after voting with Democrats on extending the cap-and-trade automobile emission program.“We seek to shed the stereotype of the intolerant Republican Party that serves only the rich and big business,” Mr. Mayes said.

Mr. Schwarzenegger was not the only Republican firepower on stage: John Kasich, the governor of Ohio, who is considering challenging President Trump for the Republican nomination in 2020, was also on hand.        Continue reading the main story

        In Sacramento, the former governor — and occasional actor — broke with national Republicans (at least of today) when he championed environmental protection efforts, including stringent emission controls. In sentiments also reflected by Mr. Kasich and Mr. Mayes, Mr. Schwarzenegger said the Republican Party had to be “environmentally progressive, socially liberal and fiscally conservative” in order to be competitive.“Our party is giving them Twitter fights instead of answers,” Mr. Schwarzenegger said. “And it is sinking us. It is time to return to the issues.”“The politics of division and anger and resentment can drive a strong base to the polls, yes,” he said. “But it is tearing our country apart at the seams. And nothing is getting done.”

        “Whenever there’s an issue where someone’s data gets passed to someone who the rules of the system shouldn’t have allowed it to, that’s rightfully a big issue and deserves to be a big uproar,” Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, said in an interview.

            • Mark Zuckerberg on whether he’s concerned about Facebook users deleting their accounts. “I think it’s a clear signal that this is a major trust issue for people, and I understand that. And whether people delete their app over it or just don’t feel good about using Facebook, that’s a big issue that I think we have a responsibility to rectify.” Full interview.• You can quit Facebook if you simply find no joy in it. But if you’re looking to leave for philosophical reasons concerning privacy, it’s a futile effort. You may be better off tweaking your privacy settings on the site. [The New York Times]• Mayor Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles hasn’t made it official yet. But he visited New Hampshire last year and is traveling to Iowa in April.

[The New York Times]And Finally ...The Times reporter David Streitfeld had an article Wednesday on Facebook’s plans to build a community with housing and retail in its hometown, Menlo Park in Silicon Valley. But if reader comments are any indication, the project faces an uphill battle to acceptance.Many commenters referenced the escalating crisis over Cambridge Analytica and the company’s lax approach to privacy as reason enough to stay away. Facebook might have two billion users, but many are wary of living in Facebookland:• “That sounds great: a whole city full of ‘Ready Player One’ arrogant nerds closing ranks against reality. We can measure their success by the zeroed-out birthrate and the truckloads of Amazon boxes full of inflatable companionship.”

• “Much like smart speakers, this new model community is a Faustian bargain, where you sacrifice your personal privacy and private data rights in exchange for high-end centrally located conveniences all too willingly provided by a company whose sole intent is to monetize the details of your daily life by auctioning off your information to the highest bidder.”But a few readers celebrated the efficiency of Big Tech:• “I’ve been much more pleased with my dealings with Facebook — and Google, and Apple, and Amazon — than any city, county, or state government. I’ve gotten extreme value from tech, while I’ve mostly got waste, incompetence and corruption from government.”

Revelations that a voter-profiling company that worked Donald J. Trump’s presidential campaign harvested private information from 50 million Facebook profiles have many people wondering: What, if anything, can they do to protect their data connected to the social network?Here’s the harsh truth: Not much, short of ceasing to browse the web entirely or deleting your Facebook account.Yet there are some best practices you can employ to help safeguard your data, such as installing software to block web tracking technologies and carefully vetting the apps that you use on Facebook.But it also helps to understand what exactly happened with those 50 million profiles in order to determine how you can better protect your data. Here’s what you need to know.

So what happened?An academic researcher at Cambridge University built an app called thisisyourdigitallife, which offered to pay Facebook users to take a personality test and agree to share that data for academic use. About 270,000 people participated in the study — enough to extract information on tens of millions of Facebooks users.        Continue reading the main story

        How did Cambridge Analytica get data on 50 million people when only 270,000 people had agreed to hand over their information to a third party? Facebook said people who downloaded the app gave consent for the app to collect limited information about their friends whose privacy settings were set to allow it.That information was eventually paid for by Cambridge Analytica, the voter profiling company that worked with the Trump campaign.

O.K., so what do I do now?There is a multipronged approach you can take to protect yourself from data-harvesting apps and programs. That includes tools you can install in your browser and settings you can tweak on Facebook. Here’s a run down of what you should do:• Audit your Facebook apps. If you used Facebook to sign in to a third-party website, game or app, those services may continue to access your personal data. On Facebook, go to the settings page and click on the Apps tab to see which apps are connected to your account. From there, you can take a closer look at the permissions you granted to each app to see what information you are sharing. Remove any apps that you find suspicious or no longer use. (Facebook has also made some changes to prevent the gathering of detailed information of friends of users.)On the App Settings page there is another setting called Apps Others Use. This is where you choose which details are shared about you when your friends use apps. Make sure to uncheck all the boxes if you don’t want any of your information, like your birthday or hometown, accessed by your friends’ apps.• Audit your Facebook privacy settings. If you are concerned about what details apps can see about you and your Facebook friends, now is a good time to check your privacy settings and minimize the information you share publicly. For example, you can make sure that only your friends can see your Facebook posts, or that only you can see your friends list.• Read privacy policies. When you sign up for a new app or web tool, the company typically asks you to agree to its terms of service. Make it a habit to peruse the terms and pay particular attention to the privacy policy. If you see language that suggests your data could be shared in a way that makes you uncomfortable, don’t use the program.• Install a tracker blocker. There are add-ons that you can install in your browser that try to block trackers embedded on websites. But be aware that in some cases, they will make parts of websites work improperly. In our tests, Disconnect and Privacy Badger were useful tools for blocking trackers on Google’s Chrome browser.

Here’s a primer on how tracking works, to give you a sense of why blockers are important: When you engage with an app on Facebook, it may plant a tracker in your web browser, like a cookie, that collects information from you. Even when you close out of the app, the tracker can continue to follow your activities, like the other sites you visit or the people you interact with through status updates, according to Michael Priem, chief executive of Modern Impact, an advertising firm in Minneapolis.“It doesn’t go away after you’ve stopped looking at the ad,” he said.• Install an ad blocker. Another way to block trackers is to prevent ads from loading altogether. Ad blockers are also add-ons that you can install for your browser on your mobile device or computer. Mobile ads are fully functioning programs, and they sometimes include malware that harvest some of your data. Even the largest websites do not have tight control over the ads that appear on their sites — and sometimes malicious code can appear inside their ad networks. A popular ad blocker among security researchers is uBlock Origin.• Clear your browsing data. Periodically, you can clear your cookies and browsing history. Apple, Google and Microsoft have published instructions on how to clear data for their browsers Safari, Chrome and Internet Explorer. That will temporarily delete cookies and trackers, though they will probably reappear over time.• Be wary of unknown brands. Even if you read the privacy policies, you still may have to take them with a grain of salt. In the case of the thisisyourdigitallife app, the fine print said the information would be collected for academic use, not commercial purposes. So think twice before sharing information with unfamiliar companies or organizations. (Then again, the researcher came from Cambridge University, one of the world’s top schools — so who can you really trust?)

Sign up here.Mark Zuckerberg has broken his silence on the Cambridge Analytica crisis.Facebook’s chief executive posted a statement on his Facebook page, saying he was taking action to prevent people’s data on the social network from being misused.

“We have a responsibility to protect your data, and if we can’t then we don’t deserve to serve you,” Mr. Zuckerberg wrote. “I’ve been working to understand exactly what happened and how to make sure this doesn’t happen again.”        Continue reading the main story

        Here are the steps the company is taking to address the issue:• “We will investigate all apps that had access to large amounts of information before we changed our platform to dramatically reduce data access in 2014, and we will conduct a full audit of any app with suspicious activity.”• “We will restrict developers’ data access even further to prevent other kinds of abuse.”• “We want to make sure you understand which apps you’ve allowed to access your data. In the next month, we will show everyone a tool at the top of your News Feed with the apps you’ve used and an easy way to revoke those apps’ permissions to your data.”Mr. Zuckerberg had drawn criticism for his response to how Cambridge Analytica improperly obtained data on 50 million Facebook users. In the days since the news first broke this weekend, he had not commented publicly on the crisis.That contrasts with how other tech chief executives have addressed crises at their firms.Kevin Roose and Sheera Frenkel of the NYT report:When a former engineer revealed a pattern of sexual harassment at Uber last year, Travis Kalanick, then the company’s chief executive, said he would immediately open an investigation.
When users complained about bugs and problems with the Apple Maps app in 2012, Tim Cook, the company’s chief executive, released a statement that said “we fell short.”
And in 2011, when Netflix tried to split off its mail-order DVD business into a company called Qwikster, its chief executive, Reed Hastings, wrote a letter to the public. “I messed up,” he said. “I owe everyone an explanation.”So why did it take so long for Mr. Zuckerberg to respond? Kate Losse, an early Facebook employee and Mr. Zuckerberg’s former speechwriter, told the NYT: “My guess is that what is giving Zuckerberg pause at this point is the question of how to acknowledge and explain this state of affairs while at the same time mitigating the concerns that will come from people finally understanding how this all worked.”Peter Eavis’s take: There was something missing from Mark Zuckerberg’s response – a full explanation of why Facebook took so long to disclose the misuse of its data. As Mr. Zuckerberg noted, Facebook found out in 2015 that Aleksandr Kogan had violated company policies by sharing user data with Cambridge Analytica. Facebook users might ask why the abuse wasn’t disclosed at the time. Often it has taken pressure from outsiders to get Facebook to reveal abuses of its network. An alternative approach would have been for Facebook to proactively disclose as much information as possible about the wrongdoing. Facebook users would most likely welcome a strong commitment from Mr. Zuckerberg to do just that.Photo

            Takeaways from Powell’s first Fed meeting.The Federal Reserve, as widely expected, raised interest rates on Wednesday by a quarter of a percentage point. The bigger questions were about the strength of the economy and pace of future rate increases.On those matters, the Federal Reserve has expressed more confidence in the strength of the economy.Dot plot: Fed officials signaled they would raise rates at a quicker pace over the next three years. Policymakers now expect to hike rates three times this year, three times in 2019 and twice in 2020. At its December meeting, policymakers expected three rate hikes this year, but just two in 2019.

Economic projections: Officials raised their median estimates for economic growth this year to 2.7 percent, up from 2.5 percent in December. Fed policymakers also expect inflation to run above 2 percent by 2019 and 2020.Mr. Powell’s news conference: The new Fed chairman expressed optimism about the current economic picture and said officials were trying to strike a balance between raising rates too slowly or too quickly. “We’re trying to take that middle ground.”Mr. Powell left the door open to more or fewer than three increases this year, depending on economic conditions. “Like any set of forecasts, those forecasts will change over time,” he said. “It could change up. It could change down”On inflation, he added: “There is no sense in the data that we’re on the cusp of an acceleration of inflation. We have seen moderate increases in wages and price inflation. And we seem to be seeing more of that.”Photo

            Why driverless cars are essential to Uber’s future.The answer has to do with car ownership. For years, Uber and its rivals have promoted the idea that people living in urban areas will turn to Uber to get to and from work and to run errands rather than buy a car.If Uber can become an alternative to car ownership, that would greatly increase its potential market.A study last year from the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute, Texas A&M Transportation Institute, and Columbia University suggested that people might make the switch.But for people give up their cars, the cost of using Uber would most likely have to fall far below current levels. The need for this drop in costs came up when Dara Khosrowshahi, the C.E.O. of Uber, recently sat down for an interview with David Solomon, president and C.O.O. of Goldman Sachs.

Here’s the write-up of the autonomous car portion of their conversation in a recent Goldman note to clients:“Uber stressed the importance not only of autonomous technology for the future of the company, but also the value it can create from developing that technology within its existing network. In order for Uber to truly become a legitimate alternative to car ownership it must take its per mile cost below the cost of car ownership, or $0.80-$0.90/mile, from the $2.50/mile it costs on average today for an UberX, according to management. While initiatives like pooling (50% of rides in some cities) and driver density can help to lower costs, autonomous is the single most transformative piece of the equation. Uber expects to partner aggressively on this front, noting that ‘winning’ is making sure every single autonomous player is plugged into its network.”Calculating the fallout from the Uber self-driving car death.The pedestrian fatality in Arizona is perhaps Dara Khosrowshahi’s first major test as Uber’s C.E.O., leaving him with a difficult choice: keep spending on a technology that Uber considers essential to its future, or dial back to reduce risks ahead of an I.P.O.?Investigators are also looking into whether the victim’s actions — suddenly stepping onto a darkened street — could limit Uber’s liability.Toyota has paused its self-driving tests; Ford and G.M. have yet to do so. Separately, Uber has hired Tammy Albarran from Covington and Burling as its deputy general counsel, replacing Angela Padilla.Elsewhere in tech: The Russian cybersecurity company Kaspersky Labs has reportedly exposed a U.S. cyberespionage operation focused on ISIS. Expect a merger frenzy in lithium. Expedia’s Orbitz disclosed a breach that affects about 880,000 payment cards. And Amazon has surpassed Alphabet as the second-biggest publicly traded company by market value.Tesla’s shareholders approve Musk’s pay package.The electric car maker’s investors backed the board’s proposal to grant Elon Musk, its C.E.O., stock options valued at $2.6 billion, Bloomberg reports.The stock options won’t vest unless a set of ambitious financial goals are met. “Mr. Musk will earn one-12th of the options every time Tesla hits a pair of goals: one tied to its market value and the other linked to either revenue or earnings excluding certain charges. For Musk to get all the options, Tesla would have to become worth $650 billion — more than Facebook Inc. — and produce more revenue than Procter & Gamble Co.,” Bloomberg reports.Photo

            Pete Peterson is dead at 91The billionaire — whose career highlights include being C.E.O. of a major industrial company at 36, serving in the Nixon administration, running Lehman Brothers, cofounding the Blackstone Group and doggedly arguing for reducing the U.S. deficit — died yesterday.Mr. Peterson was always self-deprecating, once describing himself to the NYT as a “kind of a closet, second-rate intellectual.” And this is from a 2007 Lunch with the FT:“Let’s be honest,” he says, “dumb luck can play a huge role in life. It is all too easy in the 1990s for people to say I must be a genius investor because I got returns of 30 percent or whatever. If you combine a lot of leverage with a booming stock market it isn’t all that difficult to make a lot of money, so I don’t think we should get carried away with ourselves, frankly.”What to expect from the forthcoming spending billCourtesy of our colleague Tom Kaplan:

The deal is still awaiting approval from American regulators, with the German chemicals giant saying on Wednesdaythat it was “working closely” with the Justice Department and other United States authorities. Bayer hopes to close the transaction by the end of the second quarter.To win approval of European regulators, the companies said they would sell a variety of businesses, including agreeing to sell parts of Bayer’s crop science business to BASF for about $7 billion in October.Bayer has committed to sell its entire vegetable seeds business as part of its concessions, European regulators said in a news release on Thursday. Bayer previously said it was in exclusive talks with BASF about the sale of that business.— Chad BrayPhoto

The Federal Trade Commission is investigating whether it has violated a privacy agreement. Britain’s data protection watchdog has warned Facebook away from its Cambridge Analytica investigation. And a founder of WhatsApp urged his Twitter followers to delete their accounts.Given all that, Paul Ford asks in Bloomberg Businessweek whether the U.S. needs a digital protection agency, comparing its potential scope to that of the Environmental Protection Agency.Mark Zuckerberg, silent so far, is expected to speak about Facebook’s latest scandal within the next 24 hours, according to Axios.Critics’ corner• Sandy Parakilas, a former Facebook employee involved in its apps platform, writes: “Facebook has systematically failed to enforce its own policies. The only solution is external oversight.” (WaPo)• Shira Ovide says the damage may be permanent. (Gadfly)• Nick Thompson and Fred Vogelstein say Facebook may have taken the wrong lesson from past scandals: “All of those crises have passed with limited damage. And perhaps that’s why the company appears to have underestimated the power of the storm clouds moving in.” (Wired)

            The race to avoid U.S. tariffsAt the Group of 20’s meeting in Buenos Aires, finance ministers from France, Argentina, South Korea and elsewhere peppered Steven Mnuchin with requests for exemptions from President Trump’s forthcoming tariffs on imported metal. The U.S. Treasury secretary said, “This is all about free and fair and reciprocal trade.”The problem: The White House hasn’t said exactly what would qualify a country for an exemption (it has made vague references to protecting national security and reducing bilateral trade deficits).Meanwhile, the White House is ready to announce more tariffs and limits on Chinese investments as soon as tomorrow — risking a trade war that it can’t win on its own, Michael Schuman argues on Bloomberg View.Elsewhere in trade: The White House’s efforts to renegotiate Nafta now include a bid to limit warning labels on junk food, according to the NYT.The political flyaround• Congress continues to discuss its $1.3 trillion spending bill.

For much of the past week, Facebook has been embroiled in a controversy involving Cambridge Analytica, a political consulting firm with ties to Donald J. Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign, and how the firm improperly obtained and exploited personal data from 50 million Facebook users.On Wednesday, following widespread questions about his whereabouts, Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Facebook, spoke with two New York Times reporters, Sheera Frenkel and Kevin Roose, about the controversy and the steps he was taking to make the social network less prone to abuse.Video

                Recent reports of a Facebook data breach by Cambridge Analytica has caused some to reconsider staying with the social media platform. Following a conversation with Mark Zuckerberg, NYT tech reporter, Kevin Roose, chatted with Facebook live viewers about whether or not they plan to sign-off for good.

    Below is a transcript of the conversation, edited for length and clarity.Sheera Frenkel: Did it come as a surprise to you, the user response to the news that Cambridge Analytica had accessed this trove of data?Mark Zuckerberg: Privacy issues have always been incredibly important to people. One of our biggest responsibilities is to protect data. If you think about what our services are, at their most basic level, you put some content into a service, whether it’s a photo or a video or a text message — whether it’s Facebook or WhatsApp or Instagram — and you’re trusting that that content is going to be shared with the people you want to share it with. Whenever there’s an issue where someone’s data gets passed to someone who the rules of the system shouldn’t have allowed it to, that’s rightfully a big issue and deserves to be a big uproar.

Frenkel: It took quite a few days for your response to come out. Is that because you were weighing these three action points that you noted in your post?        Continue reading the main story

        Zuckerberg: The first thing is, I really wanted to make sure we had a full and accurate understanding of everything that happened. I know that there was a lot of pressure to speak sooner, but my assessment was that it was more important that what we said was fully accurate.The second thing is, the most important thing is that we fix this system so that issues like this don’t happen again. It’s not like there aren’t going to be other different kind of things we’ll also have to fix. But when there’s a certain problem, we have a responsibility to at least make sure we resolve that problem.So the actions here that we’re going to do involve first, dramatically reducing the amount of data that developers have access to, so that apps and developers can’t do what Kogan did here. The most important actions there we actually took three or four years ago, in 2014. But when we examined the systems this week, there were certainly other things we felt we should lock down, too. So we’re going ahead and doing that.Even if you solve the problem going forward, there’s still this issue of: Are there other Cambridge Analyticas out there, or other Kogans who, when the platform worked a certain way in the past, were there apps which could have gotten access to more information, and potentially sold it without us knowing, or done something that violated people’s trust? We also need to make sure we get that under control. That’s why we spent a lot of time figuring out, O.K. here’s what it’s going to take to do a full investigation of every app that got access to a large amount of information before we changed the platform policies to dramatically reduce the data access that developers had. For any app that we uncover that has any suspicious activity, we’re going to go do a full forensic audit, and make sure we have the capacity to do that, to make sure that other developers aren’t doing what Kogan did here.The third thing is, it’s really important that people know what apps they’ve authorized. A lot of people have been on Facebook now for five or 10 years, and sometimes you signed into an app a long time ago and you may have forgotten about that. So one of the steps we’re taking is making it so apps can no longer access data after you haven’t used them for three months.But it’s also just really important to put in front of people a tool of, here are all the apps you’ve connected to and authorized, here’s an easy way to deauthorize them, to revoke their permission to get access to your activity.Kevin Roose: Is Facebook planning to notify the 50 million users whose data was shared with Cambridge Analytica?

Zuckerberg: Yes. We’re going to tell anyone whose data may have been shared.Now, there’s a question of whether we have the exact record in our systems today of who your friends were on that day when there was access three and a half or four years ago, so we’re going to be conservative on that and try to tell anyone whose data may have been affected, even if we don’t know for certain that they were. It’s likely that we’ll build a tool like we did with the Russian misinformation investigation, that anyone can go to it and see if their data was affected by this.Roose: Do you have a preliminary estimate of how many apps you’ll be investigating?Zuckerberg: It will be in the thousands.Frenkel: Were those app developers notified that you’ll be investigating this yet?Zuckerberg: Just when I posted. And we’ll be reaching out in the near term.Frenkel: Are you going to be hiring people to help conduct those investigations?Zuckerberg: Yes, I would imagine we’re going to have to grow the team to work on this.Roose: You mentioned a contract that developers will have to sign in order to ask anyone for access to broader profile information. What will be the terms of that contract, and what will be the penalties for violating it?Zuckerberg: So, the important thing there is that it’s a high-touch process. The specific point we were trying to make is that it’s not going to be some terms of service that a developer can sign up for just on their computer when developing something. I guess technically, that would be a contract as well.The point of what we’re trying to do here is to create a situation where we have a real person-to-person relationship with any developer who is asking for the most sensitive data. That doesn’t mean that — if you’re a developer and you want to put Facebook Login on your website, you can do that. If you want to get access to ask people for their religious affiliation, or their sexual orientation, for data that could be very sensitive, we want to make sure we have a clear relationship with those people.Frenkel: We understood that Cambridge Analytica had reached out to Facebook and asked that its ban on the platform be reconsidered. Are you giving any thought to allowing Cambridge Analytica back in?

Zuckerberg: The first thing we need to do is conduct this full forensic audit of the firm, that they don’t have any people’s data from our community and that they’ve deleted anything, including derivative data, that they might have. We’re working with the regulator in the U.K. on this, so our forensic audit was actually paused in the near term to cede the way for the ICO there to do their own government investigation. We’re certainly not going to consider letting them back onto the platform until we have full confirmation that there’s no wrongdoing here.Roose: There were reports as far back as 2015 that Cambridge Analytica had access to this data set. Why didn’t you suspend them then?Zuckerberg: So, we actually heard, I think it was at the end of 2015 — some journalists from The Guardian reached out to us and told us what you just said. And it was not just about Cambridge Analytica, it was about this developer, Aleksandr Kogan, who had shared data with them.

We took action immediately at that point. We banned Kogan’s app from the platform, we demanded that Kogan and Cambridge Analytica and a couple other parties that Kogan had shared the data with would legally certify that they didn’t have the data, and weren’t using it in any of their operations. They gave us that formal certification. At the time, they told us they never had gotten access to raw Facebook data, so we made that decision.Frenkel: In retrospect, do you wish you had demanded proof that the data had been deleted?Zuckerberg: Yes. They gave us a formal and legal certification, and it seems at this point that that was false.Again, we haven’t done our full investigation and audit yet so I can’t say definitively that they actually have data. I’ve just read all the same reports that you have, including in The New York Times, that says that journalists have seen evidence that they have the data, which is a strong enough signal for us to go on, and take action here.That’s the basic driver behind us now needing to go and do a full investigation into any app that had access to a large amount of data before we locked down the platform policies in 2014. Just having folks tell us that they were using the data correctly, I think, does not satisfy our responsibility to our community to protect their data.Frenkel: Are you actively looking at some of these dark web data brokers that have been in news reports recently, that say that other independent researchers are potentially trading in this data?

Zuckerberg: Yes, we’re investigating that too.Roose: Are you worried about the #DeleteFacebook campaign that’s been going around? Have you seen meaningful numbers of people deleting their accounts, and are you worried that will be a trend?Zuckerberg: I don’t think we’ve seen a meaningful number of people act on that, but, you know, it’s not good. I think it’s a clear signal that this is a major trust issue for people, and I understand that. And whether people delete their app over it or just don’t feel good about using Facebook, that’s a big issue that I think we have a responsibility to rectify.Frenkel: We’re now heading into the 2018 midterms. Could you speak about what Facebook is going to do ahead of the 2018 midterms to make people feel more confident that the platform won’t be used this way again?Zuckerberg: This is an incredibly important point. There’s no doubt that in 2016, there were a number of issues including foreign interference and false news that we did not have as much of a handle on as we feel a responsibility to for our community.Now, the good news here is that these problems aren’t necessarily rocket science. They’re hard, but they’re things that if you invest and work on making it harder for adversaries to do what they’re trying to do, you can really reduce the amount of false news, make it harder for foreign governments to interfere.One of the things that gives me confidence is that we’ve seen a number of elections at this point where this has gone a lot better. In the months after the 2016 election, there was the French election. The new A.I. tools we built after the 2016 elections found, I think, more than 30,000 fake accounts that we believe were linked to Russian sources who were trying to do the same kind of tactics they did in the U.S. in the 2016 election. We were able to disable them and prevent that from happening on a large scale in France.In last year, in 2017 with the special election in Alabama, we deployed some new A.I. tools to identify fake accounts and false news, and we found a significant number of Macedonian accounts that were trying to spread false news, and were able to eliminate those. And that, actually, is something I haven’t talked about publicly before, so you’re the first people I’m telling about that.I feel a lot better about the systems now. At the same time, I think Russia and other governments are going to get more sophisticated in what they do, too. So we need to make sure that we up our game. This is a massive focus for us to make sure we’re dialed in for not only the 2018 elections in the U.S., but the Indian elections, the Brazilian elections, and a number of other elections that are going on this year that are really important.

Frenkel: The Times reported that [Facebook chief security officer Alex] Stamos will be leaving toward the end of this year. Is there a broader plan for how Facebook is going to structure security on its platform ahead of all these important elections?Zuckerberg: Sure. One of the important things we’ve done is, we want to unify all of our security efforts. And you reported on a reorg around Alex Stamos, and I’ll say something about him in a second. He’s been a very valuable contributor here and was a really central figure in helping us identify the foreign interference with Russia. And I think he has done very good work, and I’m hopeful he’ll be engaged for a while here on that.One of the big things we needed to do is coordinate our efforts a lot better across the whole company. It’s not all A.I., right? There’s certainly a lot that A.I. can do, we can train classifiers to identify content, but most of what we do is identify things that people should look at. So we’re going to double the amount of people working on security this year. We’ll have more than 20,000 people working on security and community operations by the end of the year, I think we have about 15,000 now. So it’s really the technical systems we have working with the people in our operations functions that make the biggest deal.The last thing I’d add on this. Take things like false news. You know, a lot of it is really spam, if you think about it. It’s the same people who might have been sending you Viagra emails in the ’90s, now they’re trying to come up with sensational content and push it into Facebook and other apps in order to get you to click on it and see ads. There are some pretty basic policy decisions we’ve made, like O.K., if you’re anywhere close to being a fake news site, you can’t put Facebook ads on your site, right? So then suddenly, it becomes harder for them to make money. If you make it hard enough for them to make money, they just kind of go and do something else.Roose: Is the basic economic model of Facebook, in which users provide data that Facebook uses to help advertisers and developers to better target potential customers and users — do you feel like that works, given what we now know about the risks?Zuckerberg: Yeah, so this is a really important question. The thing about the ad model that is really important that aligns with our mission is that — our mission is to build a community for everyone in the world and to bring the world closer together. And a really important part of that is making a service that people can afford. A lot of the people, once you get past the first billion people, can’t afford to pay a lot. Therefore, having it be free and have a business model that is ad-supported ends up being really important and aligned.Now, over time, might there be ways for people who can afford it to pay a different way? That’s certainly something we’ve thought about over time. But I don’t think the ad model is going to go away, because I think fundamentally, it’s important to have a service like this that everyone in the world can use, and the only way to do that is to have it be very cheap or free.Roose: Adam Mosseri, Facebook’s head of News Feed, recently said he had lost some sleep over Facebook’s role in the violence in Myanmar. You’ve said you’re “outraged” about what happened with Cambridge Analytica, but when you think about the many things that are happening with Facebook all over the world, are you losing any sleep? Do you feel any guilt about the role Facebook is playing in the world?

Zuckerberg: That’s a good question. I think, you know, we’re doing something here which is unprecedented, in terms of building a community for people all over the world to be able to share what matters to them, and connect across boundaries. I think what we’re seeing is, there are new challenges that I don’t think anyone had anticipated before.If you had asked me, when I got started with Facebook, if one of the central things I’d need to work on now is preventing governments from interfering in each other’s elections, there’s no way I thought that’s what I’d be doing, if we talked in 2004 in my dorm room.

I don’t know that it’s possible to know every issue that you’re going to face down the road. But we have a real responsibility to take all these issues seriously as they come up, and work with experts and people around the world to make sure we solve them, and do a good job for our community.It’s certainly true that, over the course of Facebook, I’ve made all kinds of different mistakes, whether that’s technical mistakes or business mistakes or hiring mistakes. We’ve launched product after product that didn’t work. I spend most of my time looking forward, trying to figure out how to solve the issues that people are having today, because I think that’s what people in our community would want.
