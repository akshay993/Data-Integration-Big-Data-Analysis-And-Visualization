        LONDON/SAN FRANCISCO —  The suspended chief executive of Cambridge Analytica said in a secretly recorded video broadcast on Tuesday that his UK-based political consultancy's online campaign played a decisive role in U.S. President Donald Trump's 2016 election victory.CEO Alexander Nix's comments, which could not be verified, are potentially a further problem for Facebook Inc as it faces lawmakers' scrutiny in the United States and Europe over Cambridge Analytica's improper use of 50 million Facebook users' personal data to target voters.The social media network's shares fell for a second day, closing down 2.5 percent, as investors worried that its dealings with Cambridge Analytica might damage its reputation, deter advertisers and invite restrictive regulation. The company has lost $60 billion of its stock market value over the last two days.Cambridge Analytica's board of directors suspended Nix on Tuesday, shortly before the second part of British broadcaster Channel 4's expose of the firm's methods.

        Nix’s comments ""do not represent the values or operations of the firm and his suspension reflects the seriousness with which we view this violation,"" Cambridge Analytica said in a statement on Tuesday.Cambridge Analytica has denied all the media claims and said it deleted the data after learning the information did not adhere to data protection rules.Brad Parscale, the 2016 Trump campaign’s main digital adviser who dealt regularly with Cambridge Analytica, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Nix's claims.Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law and now senior adviser, oversaw the Trump campaign's digital operations. One former Trump adviser said Kushner brought Cambridge Analytica into the 2016 campaign effort. Kushner's lawyer did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Cambridge Analytica whistleblower Christopher Wylie told the Washington Post on Tuesday that in 2014 conservative strategist Steve Bannon, who would go on to be Trump's White House adviser, oversaw the firm's early efforts to collect Facebook data to build detailed profiles on millions of American voters. (http://wapo.st/2HOTQNu)Bannon approved spending nearly $1 million to acquire data, including Facebook profiles, in 2014, Wylie told the Post. It is unclear whether Bannon knew how Cambridge Analytica was obtaining the Facebook data, the Post reported.Bannon, who served on Cambridge Analytica's board, did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Reuters.

U.S. law bans foreigners from making contributions or spending money on behalf of a U.S. election campaign but it was not illegal for the Trump campaign to retain Cambridge Analytica's services, according to Bradley Smith, a former Republican member of the U.S. Federal Election Commission.""The fact that they are a British company doesn’t add anything to the analysis unless they were giving their services away for free or charging below-market rates,” said Smith, now a professor at the Capital University Law School in Columbus, Ohio.FTC REVIEW, LAWSUITU.S. and European lawmakers have demanded an explanation of how Cambridge Analytica gained access to user data in 2014 and why Facebook failed to inform its users, raising broader industry questions about consumer privacy.Facebook said it had been told by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the leading U.S. consumer regulator, that it would receive a letter this week with questions about the data acquired by Cambridge Analytica. It said it had no indication of a formal investigation.""The entire company is outraged we were deceived,"" Facebook said in a statement on Tuesday. ""We are committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information and will take whatever steps are required to see that this happens.”

The FTC is reviewing whether Facebook violated a 2011 consent decree it reached with the authority over its privacy practices, a person briefed on the matter told Reuters.If the FTC finds Facebook violated terms of the consent decree, it has the power to fine the company thousands of dollars a day per violation, which could add up to billions of dollars.Facebook was also hit on Tuesday in a San Francisco court by the first of what could be many lawsuits by shareholders claiming to suffer losses because the company misled them about its ability to protect user data. The company could also soon face lawsuits on behalf of users whose personal information was exposed.Facebook and its peers Alphabet Inc's Google and   Twitter already face a backlash from users and lawmakers over their role during the U.S. presidential election by allowing the spread of false information that might have swayed voters toward Trump.

Fear of increased regulation hurt other social media firms on Tuesday. Shares of Snap Inc fell 2.5 percent and Twitter Inc fell more than 10 percent.FOREIGN INFLUENCEU.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, called on Tuesday for Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to testify in Congress. Congressional staff said the company would brief U.S. Senate and House aides on Wednesday.A Congressional official said House Intelligence Committee Democrats plan to interview Cambridge Analytica whistleblower Wylie. The committee interviewed Nix by video teleconference, according to the Congressional official, but a transcript of that interview has not yet been made public.The Senate Intelligence Committee, which is conducting a long-term investigation of alleged Russian interference in U.S. politics and a detailed examination of U.S. election security precautions, would carry out its own inquiry of Cambridge Analytica, a Congressional official with direct knowledge of the investigation said.The White House said it welcomed inquiries, and that the president believes that Americans' privacy should be protected.PERSONAL INFORMATIONIn Britain, the Information Commissioner's Office, an independent authority set up to uphold information rights in the public interest, was seeking a warrant from a judge to search the offices of London-based Cambridge Analytica. It was unclear late on Tuesday whether it had obtained it.Created in 2013, Cambridge Analytica markets itself as a source of consumer research, targeted advertising and other data-related services to both political and corporate clients.According to the New York Times, it was launched with $15 million in backing from billionaire Republican donor Robert Mercer and a name chosen by Bannon.

Facebook says the data were harvested by a British academic, Aleksandr Kogan, who created an app on the platform that was downloaded by 270,000 people, providing access not only to their own personal data but also data from their friends.Facebook said Kogan then violated its policies by passing the data to Cambridge Analytica. Facebook has since suspended both the consulting firm and SCL (Strategic Communication Laboratories), a government and military contractor.Facebook said it had been told that the data were destroyed. Kogan was not immediately reachable for comment.(Reporting by David Ingram in San Francisco, Kate Holton and Paul Sandle in London, David Shepardson, Susan Heavey, Mark Hosenball, Jonathan Landay and Sarah N.

        SAN FRANCISCO —  British data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica is at the center of controversy in the United States and Britain after two newspapers reported on Sunday that the company harvested personal data about Facebook users beginning in 2014.Best known for assisting the 2016 presidential campaign of U.S. President Donald Trump, Cambridge Analytica is now facing a government search of its London office, questions from U.S. state authorities, and a demand by Facebook that it submit to a forensic audit.Here is some of what is known about the company.How did it start?Cambridge Analytica is an offshoot of SCL Group, a government and military contractor that says it works on everything from food security research to counter-narcotics to political campaigns. SCL was founded more than 25 years ago, according to its website.Cambridge Analytica was created around 2013 initially with a focus on U.S. elections, with $15 million in backing from billionaire Republican donor Robert Mercer and a name chosen by future Trump White House adviser Steve Bannon, the New York Times reported.

The company, which the New York Times reported was staffed by mostly British workers then, assisted Republican Senator Ted Cruz's presidential campaign before helping Trump's.        Continue reading the main story

        What do they do?Cambridge Analytica markets itself as providing consumer research, targeted advertising and other data-related services to both political and corporate clients.It does not list its corporate clients but on its website describes them as including a daily newspaper that wanted to know more about its subscribers, a women's clothing brand that sought research on its customers and a U.S. auto insurer interested in marketing itself.Britain's Channel 4 News reported on Monday, based on secretly recorded video, that Cambridge Analytica secretly stage-managed Kenya President Uhuru Kenyatta's campaigns in the hotly contested 2013 and 2017 elections. Cambridge Analytica denied the report.The company's website lists five office locations in New York, Washington, London, Brazil and Malaysia.When did it first get attention?After Trump won the White House in 2016, in part with the firm's help, Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix went to more clients to pitch his services, the Times reported last year. The company boasted it could develop psychological profiles of consumers and voters which was a ""secret sauce"" it used to sway them more effectively than traditional advertising could.Rival consultants and campaign aides, though, expressed doubts about the company's claims. Brad Parscale, who ran Trump's digital operations in 2016, said the campaign did not use Cambridge Analytica's data, relying instead on voter data from a Republican National Committee operation.

What is it accused of?Cambridge Analytica beginning in 2014 obtained data on 50 million Facebook users via means that deceived both the users and Facebook, the New York Times and London's Observer reported on Saturday.The data was harvested by an application developed by a British academic, Aleksandr Kogan, the newspapers said. Some 270,000 people downloaded the application and logged in with their Facebook credentials, according to Facebook. The application gathered their data and data about their friends, and then Kogan passed the data to Cambridge Analytica, according to both Cambridge Analytica and Facebook.

Cambridge Analytica said on Saturday that it did not initially know Kogan violated Facebook's terms, and that it deleted the data once it found out in 2015. Kogan could not be reached for comment.The data, though, was not deleted, the two newspapers reported on Saturday. Cambridge Analytica said that the allegation was not true. Facebook said it was investigating to verify the accuracy of the claim.What happens next?Facebook said it was pressing Cambridge Analytica for answers, after getting assurances from the firm in 2015 that it had deleted all data. Facebook has hired forensic auditors from the firm Stroz Friedberg to help.While Facebook investigates, the social network said it was suspending Cambridge Analytica, its parent SCL, Kogan and another man, Christopher Wylie, formerly of Cambridge Analytica, from its platform for violating Facebook rules.Facebook's probe, though, may have to wait until government authorities complete their investigation. The UK Information Commissioner's Office is pursuing a warrant to search Cambridge Analytica's office and asked Facebook's auditors to stand down in the meantime, according to Facebook.Attorneys general from the U.S. states of Massachusetts and Connecticut have launched investigations into how the Facebook data was handled, and the attorney general's office in California, where Facebook is based, said it had concerns.(Reporting by David Ingram)        Continue reading the main story

        LONDON —  British consultancy firm Cambridge Analytica lies at the centre of a storm for using data obtained from millions of Facebook users without their permission after it was hired by Donald Trump for his 2016 U.S. presidential election campaign.However, the analytics firm is also under scrutiny over campaigning for the 2016 referendum when Britons voted to leave the European Union.Cambridge Analytica and the leaders of the Leave.EU group have previously boasted about working together during the Brexit campaign. However, they have since retracted their claims, saying no contract was signed and no work was completed.Parliament is investigating the links between Cambridge Analytica and Leave.EU as part of an investigation into fake news.

Did Cambridge Analytica and Leave.EU work together?Arron Banks, the co-founder of Leave.EU, said in a book that in October 2015 his group hired Cambridge Analytica, a company that uses ""big data and advanced psychographics"" to influence people. In a November 2015, Leave.EU said on its website that Cambridge Analytica ""will be helping us map the British electorate and what they believe in, enabling us to better engage with voters"".

        In the same month, Cambridge Analytica director Brittany Kaiser spoke at a Leave.EU news conference. She said her organisation would be ""running large-scale research of the nation to really understand why people are interested in staying in or out of the EU"".In February 2016, Cambridge Analytica chief executive  Alexander Nix wrote in Campaign magazine that his company was working for Leave.EU. ""We have already helped supercharge Leave.EU's social media campaign by ensuring the right messages are getting to the right voters online,"" said Nix, who was suspended by the company this week.Leave.EU's communications director Andy Wigmore also said on Twitter last year that his campaign group had used the company. ""You should use Cambridge Analytics,"" he said, adding that he could ""highly recommend them"".What does Leave.EU say now?Banks says Cambridge Analytica sought work with the Leave.EU before the referendum but that ultimately it never did any - paid or otherwise - for the campaign.

""We did have dealings with Cambridge Analytica – they put forward a pitch that went into the designation document submitted to the electoral commission,"" Banks told Reuters.No work was done with Cambridge Analytica because Leave.EU did not win the designation as the official leave campaign and due to concerns about the consultancy, Banks said.When asked if Leave.EU paid or accepted any services from Cambridge Analytica, Banks said: ""No benefit in kind, no data, no nothing.""Banks told a parliamentary committee earlier this month that when he referred to Cambridge Analytica being ""hired"" in his book this was a reference to the intention to work them.

What does Cambridge Analytica say now?Nix told a parliamentary committee last month that he contacted Banks and Wigmore and their statements were not true.The article written in the Campaign magazine was a mistake and ""drafted by a slightly overzealous PR consultant"", he said.This ""referenced work that we hoped and intended to undertake for the campaign. Subsequently, work was never undertaken. The moment that that statement went out we were absolutely crystal clear to all the media outlets that we were not involved and that it had been released in error,"" he said.(Reporting by Andrew MacAskill; editing by David Stamp)        Continue reading the main story

        LONDON —  A former Cambridge Analytica political consultant said the company's management misled the British public about work the firm did for a pro-Brexit group before the vote to leave the European Union, the Guardian reported on Friday.Brittany Kaiser, a business development director at the company from 2014 until earlier this year, said in an interview that Cambridge Analytica was carrying out data crunching and analysis work for Leave.EU, while publicly denying it was doing so.The insider account puts further pressure on the London-based data analytics firm, which is already facing renewed scrutiny in the United States and Europe over allegations it improperly harvested Facebook data to target U.S. voters.Late on Friday, a High Court judge granted an application by the UK Information Commissioner's Office for a warrant to search Cambridge Analytica's offices.

I do not know how many ways I can say this. We did not work for Leave.EU. We have not undertaken any paid or unpaid work for them, okay?"" he told a committee investigating fake news in UK politics.Cambridge Analytica's board of directors suspended Nix on Tuesday shortly before British broadcaster Channel 4 aired an expose of the firm's business practices in the United States.Arron Banks, a major donor to Leave.EU, wrote in ""The Bad Boys of Brexit"" a campaign diary he published after the campaign that the group had hired Cambridge Analytica on Oct. 22, 2015 to use 'big data and advanced psychographics to influence people'.(Reporting by Eric Auchard in London; Editing by Adrian Croft)        Continue reading the main story

        LONDON —  The suspended chief executive of UK-based political consultancy Cambridge Analytica claimed in secretly recorded video that his company played a decisive role in the 2016 election campaign of President Donald Trump, Channel 4 News reported on Tuesday.British broadcaster Channel 4 News mounted a ""sting operation"" in which it secretly recorded Cambridge Analytica Chief Executive Alexander Nix saying he had met the then Republican presidential candidate ""many times"" and that his firm played a central role in the final months of the campaign.""We did all the research. We did all the data. We did all the analytics. We did all the targeting. We ran all the digital campaign and our data informed their strategy,"" Nix told an undercover reporter during a meeting in a London hotel.Brad Parscale, the 2016 Trump campaign’s main digital adviser who dealt regularly with Cambridge Analytica, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Parscale was recently named manager of Trump’s 2020 re-election campaign.

        The London-based company's statement said: ""In the view of the board, Mr. Nix’s recent comments secretly recorded by Channel 4 and other allegations do not represent the values or operations of the firm and his suspension reflects the seriousness with which we view this violation.""Nix also was recorded by Channel 4 saying that Cambridge Analytica did not have to reveal to U.S. investigators anything about the company's foreign political campaign clients. If asked, he said he would respond: ""We say 'none of your business'.""

    Why Leaving Facebook Doesn’t Always Mean Quitting

        
            
                In the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, in which data from over 50 million Facebook profiles was secretly scraped and mined for voter insights, many Facebook users have decided to delete their accounts — but untangling yourself from a site like Facebook is not as easy as pressing “delete.”

    Debates over privacy have plagued Facebook for years.But the news that  Cambridge Analytica, a political data firm that worked on President Trump’s 2016 campaign, was able to gain access to private data through the social network has sparked an unusually strong reaction among its users.The hashtag #DeleteFacebook appeared more than 10,000 times on Twitter within a two-hour period on Wednesday, according to the analytics service ExportTweet. On Tuesday, it was mentioned 40,398 times, according to the analytics service Digimind.Cher was one such deserter, writing on Twitter that the decision to quit Facebook, although “very hard,” was necessary because she loves the United States.

    For people who aren’t celebrities or billionaires, the decision to abandon Facebook came reluctantly, because the platform often served as their sole connection to certain relatives, friends and professional opportunities.

        For a long time now, Mr. Perry had wanted to leave Facebook.He never felt comfortable knowing that the company had access to much of his personal information. In the months before the 2016 presidential election, he watched the social network become what he called “a garbage platform of ads and weird reposted articles and people that you care about exposing themselves as racists.”But Facebook was also where Mr. Perry promoted his films, where he posted ads seeking help on the set, and where he communicated with colleagues and a “massive number” of his friends and relatives.Until he heard about Cambridge Analytica.“I suspected this stuff was going on, but this is the first time it’s been plainly exposed,” he said. “It seems so malicious, and Facebook seems so complicit all the way up and down, like it doesn’t care about its users.”Mr. Perry, 39, has since deleted his profile and plans to switch to Twitter and Instagram for his social media needs.“It was an easy decision,” he said. “It’s not going to be the end of the world.”______Dan ClarkA retired Navy veteran in MaineMr. Clark kept one Facebook account to chat with friends and a separate account to keep tabs on members of his family nationwide. This week, he deleted both.“Facebook was the main platform I used to keep in touch with all of them, and it was a difficult decision to give it up,” he said. “But you have to stand for something, so I just put my foot down and said enough is enough.”

Mr. Clark, 57, said he had already been angry with Facebook for censoring some of his posts, which he said expressed his staunchly conservative views but were “never evil or putting anybody down.” He could not abide the idea that his personal information was also being sold or given away without his consent.Before cutting the cord, Mr. Clark posted on Facebook inviting his contacts to ask him for his personal phone number. More than 100 people reached out within three days.“There are just so many ways nowadays to stay in contact: phones, email, instant message, Gab, which is a social network that doesn’t censor anything,” he said. “Facebook is more obsolete than people would think.”______Photo

The Cambridge Analytica scandal led her to remove the Facebook app from her phone. “I’m not going to give them my engagement clicks,” Ms. Kleeman, 32, said. But she is keeping the messaging function open for professional purposes and will continue using Instagram.She doesn’t mind the idea that some personal data can be made public — she used to have a blog, she said.“But the idea that my data could be used for purposes that I expressly don’t want, that freaks me out.”______Paul MusgraveAn assistant professor in Amherst, Mass.Twitter makes Mr. Musgrave feel depressed about the world, but Facebook is the social media platform he is trying to abandon.

As a political science teacher at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, Mr. Musgrave, 36, feels a professional responsibility to keep abreast of the news and academic chatter hurtling at him in the form of tweets.Facebook was more valuable to him as a “low-key, offstage networking tool,” a “replacement for end-of-year family newsletters” that allowed him to “passively keep up with people,” he said. He joined the platform more than a decade ago and before that had been a member of Friendster, a precursor to Facebook.But in 2016, while helping his mother during her campaign for a government position in Indiana, Mr. Musgrave discovered a “poisonous swamp” of content on the site. The Cambridge Analytica findings were even more disturbing, he said.""This is a company that has Orwellian levels of data about us, truly Big Brother-level, but it’s behaving as if it has no social responsibility and is a purely neutral medium of communication,” he said. ""That’s what’s really been scary.”Having deactivated his Facebook account, with plans to delete it, he now worries about connecting with people who use the social network as their main conduit of communication.“I’m definitely pruning myself away from some of those really important branches,” he said. “I watch my own students try to navigate the world of apps and smartphones, and even they don’t really know how the internet works outside these enclosed garden spaces.”______Photo

A year ago, Mr. Greenzweig was an “extraordinarily active” Facebook user who juggled conversations with friends, managed several groups, took out ads for his business and maintained professional contacts.But on Tuesday night, in his final post, he asked his network to connect with him through email, LinkedIn, Twitter or phone.“See everyone in the real world,” he wrote.

        (After this story was published, Facebook came under harsh criticism from lawmakers in the United States and Britain. Read the latest.)LONDON — As the upstart voter-profiling company Cambridge Analytica prepared to wade into the 2014 American midterm elections, it had a problem.The firm had secured a $15 million investment from Robert Mercer, the wealthy Republican donor, and wooed his political adviser, Stephen K. Bannon, with the promise of tools that could identify the personalities of American voters and influence their behavior. But it did not have the data to make its new products work.So the firm harvested private information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users without their permission, according to former Cambridge employees, associates and documents, making it one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history. The breach allowed the company to exploit the private social media activity of a huge swath of the American electorate, developing techniques that underpinned its work on President Trump’s campaign in 2016.

        “They want to fight a culture war in America,” he added. “Cambridge Analytica was supposed to be the arsenal of weapons to fight that culture war.”Details of Cambridge’s acquisition and use of Facebook data have surfaced in several accounts since the business began working on the 2016 campaign, setting off a furious debate about the merits of the firm’s so-called psychographic modeling techniques.But the full scale of the data leak involving Americans has not been previously disclosed — and Facebook, until now, has not acknowledged it. Interviews with a half-dozen former employees and contractors, and a review of the firm’s emails and documents, have revealed that Cambridge not only relied on the private Facebook data but still possesses most or all of the trove.Cambridge paid to acquire the personal information through an outside researcher who, Facebook says, claimed to be collecting it for academic purposes.During a week of inquiries from The Times, Facebook downplayed the scope of the leak and questioned whether any of the data still remained out of its control. But on Friday, the company posted a statement expressing alarm and promising to take action.“This was a scam — and a fraud,” Paul Grewal, a vice president and deputy general counsel at the social network, said in a statement to The Times earlier on Friday. He added that the company was suspending Cambridge Analytica, Mr. Wylie and the researcher, Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, from Facebook. “We will take whatever steps are required to see that the data in question is deleted once and for all — and take action against all offending parties,” Mr. Grewal said.

Alexander Nix, the chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, and other officials had repeatedly denied obtaining or using Facebook data, most recently during a parliamentary hearing last month. But in a statement to The Times, the company acknowledged that it had acquired the data, though it blamed Mr. Kogan for violating Facebook’s rules and said it had deleted the information as soon as it learned of the problem two years ago.In Britain, Cambridge Analytica is facing intertwined investigations by Parliament and government regulators into allegations that it performed illegal work on the “Brexit” campaign. The country has strict privacy laws, and its information commissioner announced on Saturday that she was looking into whether the Facebook data was “illegally acquired and used.”In the United States, Mr. Mercer’s daughter, Rebekah, a board member, Mr. Bannon and Mr. Nix received warnings from their lawyer that it was illegal to employ foreigners in political campaigns, according to company documents and former employees.Photo

            Congressional investigators have questioned Mr. Nix about the company’s role in the Trump campaign. And the Justice Department’s special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, has  demanded the emails of Cambridge Analytica employees who worked for the Trump team as part of his investigation into Russian interference in the election.While the substance of Mr. Mueller’s interest is a closely guarded secret, documents viewed by The Times indicate that the firm’s British affiliate claims to have worked in Russia and Ukraine. And the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, disclosed in October that Mr. Nix had reached out to him during the campaign in hopes of obtaining private emails belonging to Mr. Trump’s Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton.The documents also raise new questions about Facebook, which is already grappling with intense criticism over the spread of Russian propaganda and fake news. The data Cambridge collected from profiles, a portion of which was viewed by The Times, included details on users’ identities, friend networks and “likes.” Only a tiny fraction of the users had agreed to release their information to a third party.“Protecting people’s information is at the heart of everything we do,” Mr. Grewal said. “No systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.”Still, he added, “it’s a serious abuse of our rules.”Reading Voters’ MindsThe Bordeaux flowed freely as Mr. Nix and several colleagues sat down for dinner at the Palace Hotel in Manhattan in late 2013, Mr. Wylie recalled in an interview. They had much to celebrate.

Mr. Nix, a brash salesman, led the small elections division at SCL Group, a political and defense contractor. He had spent much of the year trying to break into the lucrative new world of political data, recruiting Mr. Wylie, then a 24-year-old political operative with ties to veterans of President Obama’s campaigns. Mr. Wylie was interested in using inherent psychological traits to affect voters’ behavior and had assembled a team of psychologists and data scientists, some of them affiliated with Cambridge University.The group experimented abroad, including in the Caribbean and Africa, where privacy rules were lax or nonexistent and politicians employing SCL were happy to provide government-held data, former employees said.Then a chance meeting brought Mr. Nix into contact with Mr. Bannon, the Breitbart News firebrand who would later become a Trump campaign and White House adviser, and with Mr. Mercer, one of the richest men on earth.

Mr. Nix and his colleagues courted Mr. Mercer, who believed a sophisticated data company could make him a kingmaker in Republican politics, and his daughter Rebekah, who shared his conservative views. Mr. Bannon was intrigued by the possibility of using personality profiling to shift America’s culture and rewire its politics, recalled Mr. Wylie and other former employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had signed nondisclosure agreements. Mr. Bannon and the Mercers declined to comment.Mr. Mercer agreed to help finance a $1.5 million pilot project to poll voters and test psychographic messaging in Virginia’s gubernatorial race in November 2013, where the Republican attorney general, Ken Cuccinelli, ran against Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic fund-raiser. Though Mr. Cuccinelli lost, Mr. Mercer committed to moving forward.The Mercers wanted results quickly, and more business beckoned. In early 2014, the investor Toby Neugebauer and other wealthy conservatives were preparing to put tens of millions of dollars behind a presidential campaign for Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, work that Mr. Nix was eager to win.When Mr. Wylie’s colleagues failed to produce a memo explaining their work to Mr. Neugebauer, Mr. Nix castigated them over email.“ITS 2 PAGES!! 4 hours work max (or an hour each). What have you all been doing??” he wrote.Mr. Wylie’s team had a bigger problem. Building psychographic profiles on a national scale required data the company could not gather without huge expense. Traditional analytics firms used voting records and consumer purchase histories to try to predict political beliefs and voting behavior.

But those kinds of records were useless for figuring out whether a particular voter was, say, a neurotic introvert, a religious extrovert, a fair-minded liberal or a fan of the occult. Those were among the psychological traits the firm claimed would provide a uniquely powerful means of designing political messages.Photo
    
            
        Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, built an app that helped the firm harvest Facebook data.
                    Mr. Wylie found a solution at Cambridge University’s Psychometrics Centre. Researchers there had developed a technique to map personality traits based on what people had liked on Facebook. The researchers paid users small sums to take a personality quiz and download an app, which would scrape some private information from their profiles and those of their friends, activity that Facebook permitted at the time. The approach, the scientists said, could reveal more about a person than their parents or romantic partners knew — a claim that has been disputed.

When the Psychometrics Centre declined to work with the firm, Mr. Wylie found someone who would: Dr. Kogan, who was then a psychology professor at the university and knew of the techniques. Dr. Kogan built his own app and in June 2014 began harvesting data for Cambridge Analytica. The business covered the costs — more than $800,000 — and allowed him to keep a copy for his own research, according to company emails and financial records.All he divulged to Facebook, and to users in fine print, was that he was collecting information for academic purposes, the social network said. It did not verify his claim. Dr. Kogan declined to provide details of what happened, citing nondisclosure agreements with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, though he maintained that his program was “a very standard vanilla Facebook app.”He ultimately provided over 50 million raw profiles to the firm, Mr. Wylie said, a number confirmed by a company email and a former colleague. Of those, roughly 30 million — a number previously reported by The Intercept — contained enough information, including places of residence, that the company could match users to other records and build psychographic profiles. Only about 270,000 users — those who participated in the survey — had consented to having their data harvested.Photo
    
            
        An email from Dr. Kogan to Mr. Wylie describing traits that could be predicted.
                    Mr. Wylie said the Facebook data was “the saving grace” that let his team deliver the models it had promised the Mercers.“We wanted as much as we could get,” he acknowledged. “Where it came from, who said we could have it — we weren’t really asking.”Mr. Nix tells a different story. Appearing before a parliamentary committee last month, he described Dr. Kogan’s contributions as “fruitless.”

An International EffortJust as Dr. Kogan’s efforts were getting underway, Mr. Mercer agreed to invest $15 million in a joint venture with SCL’s elections division. The partners devised a convoluted corporate structure, forming a new American company, owned almost entirely by Mr. Mercer, with a license to the psychographics platform developed by Mr. Wylie’s team, according to company documents. Mr. Bannon, who became a board member and investor, chose the name: Cambridge Analytica.The firm was effectively a shell. According to the documents and former employees, any contracts won by Cambridge, originally incorporated in Delaware, would be serviced by London-based SCL and overseen by Mr. Nix, a British citizen who held dual appointments at Cambridge Analytica and SCL. Most SCL employees and contractors were Canadian, like Mr. Wylie, or European.But in July 2014, an American election lawyer advising the company, Laurence Levy, warned that the arrangement could violate laws limiting the involvement of foreign nationals in American elections.In a memo to Mr. Bannon, Ms. Mercer and Mr. Nix, the lawyer, then at the firm Bracewell & Giuliani, warned that Mr. Nix would have to recuse himself “from substantive management” of any clients involved in United States elections. The data firm would also have to find American citizens or green card holders, Mr. Levy wrote, “to manage the work and decision making functions, relative to campaign messaging and expenditures.”In summer and fall 2014, Cambridge Analytica dived into the American midterm elections, mobilizing SCL contractors and employees around the country. Few Americans were involved in the work, which included polling, focus groups and message development for the John Bolton Super PAC, conservative groups in Colorado and the campaign of Senator Thom Tillis, the North Carolina Republican.Cambridge Analytica, in its statement to The Times, said that all “personnel in strategic roles were U.S. nationals or green card holders.” Mr. Nix “never had any strategic or operational role” in an American election campaign, the company said.Whether the company’s American ventures violated election laws would depend on foreign employees’ roles in each campaign, and on whether their work counted as strategic advice under Federal Election Commission rules.Cambridge Analytica appears to have exhibited a similar pattern in the 2016 election cycle, when the company worked for the campaigns of Mr. Cruz and then Mr. Trump. While Cambridge hired more Americans to work on the races that year, most of its data scientists were citizens of the United Kingdom or other European countries, according to two former employees.

Under the guidance of Brad Parscale, Mr. Trump’s digital director in 2016 and now the campaign manager for his 2020 re-election effort, Cambridge performed a variety of services, former campaign officials said. That included designing target audiences for digital ads and fund-raising appeals, modeling voter turnout, buying $5 million in television ads and determining where Mr. Trump should travel to best drum up support.Photo
    
            
        The White House advisers Stephen K. Bannon and Kellyanne Conway with Ms. Mercer at the 2017 inauguration. The firm helped the Trump campaign target voters.
                    Cambridge executives have offered conflicting accounts about the use of psychographic data on the campaign. Mr. Nix has said that the firm’s profiles helped shape Mr. Trump’s strategy — statements disputed by other campaign officials — but also that Cambridge did not have enough time to comprehensively model Trump voters.In a BBC interview last December, Mr. Nix said that the Trump efforts drew on “legacy psychographics” built for the Cruz campaign.After the LeakBy early 2015, Mr. Wylie and more than half his original team of about a dozen people had left the company. Most were liberal-leaning, and had grown disenchanted with working on behalf of the hard-right candidates the Mercer family favored.Cambridge Analytica, in its statement, said that Mr. Wylie had left to start a rival firm, and that it later took legal action against him to enforce intellectual property claims. It characterized Mr. Wylie and other former “contractors” as engaging in “what is clearly a malicious attempt to hurt the company.”Near the end of that year, a report in The Guardian revealed that Cambridge Analytica was using private Facebook data on the Cruz campaign, sending Facebook scrambling. In a statement at the time, Facebook promised that it was “carefully investigating this situation” and would require any company misusing its data to destroy it.Facebook verified the leak and — without publicly acknowledging it — sought to secure the information, efforts that continued as recently as August 2016. That month, lawyers for the social network reached out to Cambridge Analytica contractors. “This data was obtained and used without permission,” said a letter that was obtained by the Times. “It cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately.”Mr. Grewal, the Facebook deputy general counsel, said in a statement that both Dr. Kogan and “SCL Group and Cambridge Analytica certified to us that they destroyed the data in question.”Photo

            But copies of the data still remain beyond Facebook’s control. The Times viewed a set of raw data from the profiles Cambridge Analytica obtained.

While Mr. Nix has told lawmakers that the company does not have Facebook data, a former employee said that he had recently seen hundreds of gigabytes on Cambridge servers, and that the files were not encrypted.Today, as Cambridge Analytica seeks to expand its business in the United States and overseas, Mr. Nix has mentioned some questionable practices. This January, in undercover footage filmed by Channel 4 News in Britain and viewed by The Times, he boasted of employing front companies and former spies on behalf of political clients around the world, and even suggested ways to entrap politicians in compromising situations.

All the scrutiny appears to have damaged Cambridge Analytica’s political business. No American campaigns or “super PACs” have yet reported paying the company for work in the 2018 midterms, and it is unclear whether Cambridge will be asked to join Mr. Trump’s re-election campaign.In the meantime, Mr. Nix is seeking to take psychographics to the commercial advertising market. He has repositioned himself as a guru for the digital ad age — a “Math Man,” he puts it. In the United States last year, a former employee said, Cambridge pitched Mercedes-Benz, MetLife and the brewer AB InBev, but has not signed them on.

        KUALA LUMPUR —  The Malaysian government and the ruling party on Tuesday denied they had ever hired Cambridge Analytica, the British data analytics firm accused of improperly harvesting personal data from millions of Facebook users.The New York Times and the British Observer reported that Cambridge Analytica had acquired private data harvested from more than 50 million Facebook users to support Donald Trump's 2016 presidential election campaign.In a secretly recorded video by Britain's Channel 4 News, Cambridge Analytica officials were also recorded saying they have used a web of shell companies to disguise their activities in elections in Malaysia, Mexico and Brazil, among various countries where they have worked to sway election outcomes.""Contrary to media reports, neither Cambridge Analytica nor its parent company SCL Group have ever – now or in the past – been contracted, employed or paid in any way by Barisan Nasional, the Prime Minister's Office or any part of the Government of Malaysia,"" the office of Malaysian prime minister Najib Razak said on Tuesday. Barisan Nasional (BN) is Malaysia's ruling coalition.

SCL and Cambridge Analytica did not respond to requests by Reuters for comment regarding their work in Malaysia.

""The SCL representative also confirmed that he reported directly to Mukhriz Mahathir, not BN or the government,"" Najib's office said.Mukhriz told Reuters that the statement by PMO was misleading.""I categorically deny any contact with Cambridge Analytica at any time,"" he said. Earlier in the day, he denied receiving any analysis, data or advice from the firm.Mukhriz is the son of the former Malaysian premier Mahathir Mohamad, who is now the opposition's prime ministerial candidate.According to Cambridge Analytica's website, the firm ""supported Barisan Nasional in Kedah state with a targeted messaging campaign highlighting their school improvements since 2008."" It also notes how BN wrested power back from the opposition in the 2013 elections.Mukhriz was appointed chief minister of Kedah after the 2013 win, but he was sacked by the ruling party in 2016 after being critical of Najib in a corruption scandal.(Reporting by A.

        NEW YORK —  Facebook is facing the most serious crisis in its 14-year history as it deals with fallout from a major leak of user data to political consultants associated with the 2016 Trump campaign.Here's a look at the scandal and what it means.WHAT'S GOING ON?The U.K.-based data-mining firm Cambridge Analytica has been accused of lifting the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users without their permission in order to manipulate elections. A former employee of the firm, Christopher Wylie, played a role in that action, and later told his story to journalists.The crisis has renewed questions about Facebook's ability to protect the privacy of its users while also exploiting their personal details to fuel its lucrative advertising business. It has also deepened concerns about the social media network's ability to avoid being exploited to spread propaganda and sway elections.Authorities in both the U.S. and the U.K. are investigating both Facebook and Cambridge Analytica. Facebook shares have fallen and some users are contemplating deleting their accounts.

___WHAT DID CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA DO?Wylie says the firm sought Facebook information in order to build psychological profiles on a large portion of the U.S. electorate. He said the company was able to amass the database quickly with the help of an academic, Aleksander Kogan, who developed a Facebook app called ""This is Your Digital Life"" that appeared to be a personality test.

        That app vacuumed up information from users who gave the app permission to access their accounts — as well as additional data from their Facebook friends.Kogan paid about 200,000 people to take part; tens of millions of their friends were also caught in the data dragnet.___HOW HAS CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA RESPONDED?Cambridge Analytica has denied wrongdoing, and the firm said it deleted any data it received from Kogan and denied using any Facebook data in its political work. Facebook, however, said it recently learned from journalists that Cambridge Analytica may have kept some of the data, spurring an investigation.Kogan said he has been scapegoated by both Cambridge and Facebook. He says the data firm approached him for the project and assured him that everything he did was legal.___WHAT'S THE CONNECTION TO THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN?Federal election records show that the Trump campaign paid Cambridge Analytica roughly $6 million. But the campaign has denied using the firm's data, saying it relied on the Republic National Committee for its voter information.Cambridge Analytica was backed by the conservative billionaire Richard Mercer, a hedge-fund manager who supported the Trump campaign. At one point, the firm's vice president was Steve Bannon, who later became Trump's campaign chairman and White House adviser.Trump's former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, disclosed an advisory role with Cambridge Analytica last August. But the firm's parent company, Strategic Communication Laboratories, later said that position never materialized. Special counsel Robert Mueller is scrutinizing the connections between Trump's campaign and Cambridge Analytica.

Wylie, the whistleblower who worked for Cambridge from 2013 to 2015, said his team spoke to Americans in focus groups to identify deep-seated concerns and tested ways to tap into those fears through social media. He claims the slogans they developed later became the catchphrases of the Trump campaign, including ""drain the swamp"" and ""build the wall.""

Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix was caught bragging about the firm's pivotal role in the Trump campaign on a sting video from the U.K.'s Channel 4. He said Cambridge handled ""all the data, all the analytics, all the targeting"" for the campaign.___WHY ARE PEOPLE MAD AT FACEBOOK?The Cambridge Analytics fiasco appears to have crystallized the anxiety many people feel about Facebook's enormous sway over daily life and its massive data trove.A sell-off in Facebook shares reflects fear that the social network may face new regulations that could hurt profits — or that advertisers and users will sour on it.A U.K. parliamentary media committee is investigating how Facebook uses data, and has summoned CEO Mark Zuckerberg to testify. Various U.S. congressional committees are also seeking answers, although Democrats and Republicans have disagreed on what steps to take. Privacy advocates have asked the Federal Trade Commission to investigate as well.The hashtag #deletefacebook has been trending. Brian Acton, the co-founder of WhatsApp, which was acquired by Facebook four years ago for $19 billion, has joined the cause. But there are no signs, so far, that users — or advertisers — are abandoning Facebook in droves.___HOW IS FACEBOOK ADDRESSING THE CRISIS?After five days of silence, Zuckerberg released a Facebook post admitting mistakes and outlining steps to protect user data. He followed up with rare media appearances where he apologized for a breach of trust.Facebook's response, however, is limited to a narrow range of technical changes that will further limit the data apps can collect and lead to audits of apps that exhibit troubling behavior.Zuckerberg also emphasized steps the company has already taken, including reducing access outside apps had to user data in 2014. That came too late to stop Cambridge. The company said nothing about overhauling its data collection policies or taking steps to prevent the unauthorized political use of Facebook data.Facebook suspended Cambridge over allegations that it kept the improperly obtained user data. It has also suspended the access of Kogan and Wylie, as well as Cambridge's parent company, SCL.        Continue reading the main story

        LONDON —  Investigators from Britain's data watchdog searched the London offices of Cambridge Analytica, the data analytics firm at the center of a storm over allegations it improperly harvested Facebook data to target U.S. voters.About 20 officials, wearing black jackets with ""ICO Enforcement"" on them, arrived at the firm's central London offices on Friday evening soon after a High Court judge granted a search warrant sought by the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO).The officials concluded the search around 0300 GMT on Saturday. ""We will now need to assess and consider the evidence before deciding the next steps and coming to any conclusions,"" an ICO spokesperson said in a statement.The officials, who were let into the building by security guards, were seen checking books and papers through the windows of the second-floor offices on London’s busy New Oxford Street, a Reuters witness said.

        Britain is investigating whether Facebook, the world's largest social media network, did enough to protect data.U.S. lawmakers on Friday asked Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg to come to Congress to explain to explain how the data got into Cambridge Analytica's hands, adding to pressure on the firm, which is under fire from investors and advertisers.Separately on Friday, Britain's Guardian newspaper said a former Cambridge Analytica political consultant had accused the company's management of misleading the British public about work it did for a pro-Brexit group before the vote to leave the European Union.

Brittany Kaiser, a business development director at the company from 2014 until earlier this year, told the Guardian that Cambridge Analytica carried out data-crunching and analysis work for Leave.EU, while publicly denying it was doing so.Arron Banks, a major donor to Leave.EU, told the newspaper that Leave.EU did not receive any data or work from Cambridge Analytica although the UK Independence Party, which also campaigned for Brexit, gave the firm some of its data which the firm analyzed.""But it was not used in the Brexit campaign. Cambridge Analytica tried to make me pay for that work but I refused. It had nothing to do with us,"" Banks was quoted as saying.Efforts by the ICO to investigate Cambridge Analytica had hit a snag on Thursday after a judge adjourned its application to search the British consultancy group's office by 24 hours.U.S. and European lawmakers have demanded an explanation of how the British consulting firm gained access to the data in 2014 and why Facebook failed to inform its users, raising broader industry questions about consumer privacy.Facebook's Zuckerberg said on Wednesday that his company made mistakes in mishandling data and promised tougher steps to restrict developers access to data.

        NEW YORK —  The Latest on the alleged use of Facebook data to influence the U.S. presidential election (all times local):10:20 p.m.Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg says he believes it's time to impose more regulations on technology companies as they play an increasingly important role in the world. But he isn't spelling what kind of rules he would support beyond requiring clear disclosure about who is paying for online ads.Zuckerberg told CNN in an interview late Wednesday that it no longer is a question whether Facebook and other large tech companies should be more closely regulated. Instead, he says lawmakers need to work with companies to figure out what regulations make the most sense.The pressure to impose more controls on influential tech companies such as Facebook, Google and Amazon has been building as their services and products become more dominant, making it more difficult for rivals to build alternatives.Zuckerberg only said he thinks it's a good idea to require internet companies to disclose who is paying for online ads. That's a proposal under review in Congress after Facebook acknowledged Russian agents financed political ads during the 2016 presidential campaign, information about which wasn't disclosed until after the election.

        But he suggested other executives might be better qualified to field questions from lawmakers.Zuckerberg told CNN late Wednesday that he will bow to demands for him to appear before Congress if it's ""the right thing to do."" He added, however, that Facebook has other executives whose jobs are focused on certain areas that put them in a better position to give lawmakers the information they are seeking.That rationale is why Zuckerberg has sent other executives to appear in Congress to respond to hot-button issues, including whether Russian agents were able to manipulate Facebook's social network to sway the U.S. presidential election won by Donald Trump in 2016.Eventually, though, Zuckerberg said there may be situations where he is the ""sole authority."" He didn't say whether he had concluded if he is best suited to address the Facebook breakdown that led to Cambridge Analytica gaining access to personal information about 50 million Facebook users without their consent.___9:30 p.m.Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has finally apologized for weaknesses in the social network's policies that enabled an app to gain access to the personal information of 50 million users without their consent.Zuckerberg told CNN late Wednesday that he is ""really sorry,"" speaking in his first interview since news of the scandal broke last week.His mea culpa on cable television came a few hours after he acknowledged on his Facebook page that his company had made mistakes, but without saying he was sorry.During the CNN interview, Zuckerberg also expressed regrets for not doing more after Facebook first discovered that Cambridge Analytica had gained access to a broad swath of Facebook users' data in 2015.

Wolfe Murray said he declined the offer because he does not work for political parties.

        WASHINGTON —  President Barack Obama's 2012 re-election campaign mined supporters' personal data from Facebook to benefit its voter turnout program. But former campaign officials said Wednesday they accessed and used the information in vastly different ways than Cambridge Analytica, the firm connected to President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign accused of improperly lifting data on 50 million Facebook users.Former Obama advisers said they collected the data with their own app, complied with the social media platform's terms of service and received permission from supporters. An estimated 1 million Obama supporters gave the campaign access to their Facebook data.In most cases, Obama supporters who signed on to the campaign's mailing list were asked to authorize the campaign's Facebook app, allowing it to access certain aspects of their profile, including their posts, likes, photos, demographics and similar data from their Facebook friends. The Obama data was used in voter turnout efforts, with a focus on young voters in key battleground states, and former campaign officials said the data was kept secure and not sold to or acquired from third parties.Ex-Obama aides said their practices did not mirror those of Cambridge Analytica, which has been accused of acquiring personal data in unauthorized ways. The British political research firm has suspended CEO Alexander Nix pending an investigation.

Facebook said in a statement that the tweet was inaccurate, adding that ""both the Obama and Romney campaigns had access to the same tools, and no campaign received any special treatment from Facebook.""Rayid Ghani, who was chief scientist on the Obama 2012 campaign, wrote in a Medium post that the campaign only contacted people who had provided them with access to their email address. ""We did not get any contact information for their friend and did not (and could not) contact any of their friends directly,"" he wrote. He said the campaign ""did not scrape everything available on facebook about everyone we could.""""All we could do was ask our 'primary' supporters to contact their friends and we would recommend who those friends were based on the data they allowed us to access,"" Ghani said. Facebook ""did not look the other way, because they did not need to,"" he added.The tech giant in 2015 shut down app developers' ability to siphon off the data of Facebook users who used their apps.Timothy Carone, a University of Notre Dame professor specializing in data science, said in an email that it's unclear the 2012 Obama campaign could have done what Cambridge Analytica did in 2016, adding that would require a deeper dive into the 2012 campaign practices.

        LONDON —  The head of Trump-affiliated data-mining firm Cambridge Analytica has been suspended, while government authorities are bearing down on both the firm and Facebook over allegations the firm stole data from 50 million Facebook users to manipulate elections.Cambridge's board of directors suspended CEO Alexander Nix pending an investigation after Nix boasted of various unsavory services to an undercover reporter for Britain's Channel 4 News.Channel 4 News broadcast clips Tuesday that also show Nix saying his data-mining firm played a major role in securing Donald Trump's victory in the 2016 presidential elections.Nix said the firm handled ""all the data, all the analytics, all the targeting"" and said Cambridge used emails with a ""self-destruct timer"" to make its role more difficult to trace.

        Cambridge has denied wrongdoing, and Trump's campaign has said it didn't use Cambridge's data.Facebook also drew continued criticism for its alleged inaction to protect users' privacy. Earlier Tuesday, the chairman of the U.K. parliamentary media committee, Damian Collins, said his group has repeatedly asked Facebook how it uses data. He said Facebook officials ""have been misleading to the committee.""The committee summoned Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to testify.""It is now time to hear from a senior Facebook executive with the sufficient authority to give an accurate account of this catastrophic failure of process,"" Collins wrote Zuckerberg. ""Given your commitment at the start of the New Year to 'fixing' Facebook, I hope that this representative will be you.""Leading Democrats in the U.S. Senate also called on Zuckerberg to testify. Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, called Facebook's latest privacy scandal a ""danger signal."" She wants Zuckerberg's assurances that Facebook is prepared to take the lead on security measures that protect people's privacy — or Congress may step in.Facebook sidestepped questions on whether Zuckerberg would appear, saying instead that it's currently focused on conducting its own reviews.The request to appear comes as Britain's information commissioner said she was using all her legal powers to investigate the social-media giant and Cambridge Analytica.Commissioner Elizabeth Denham is pursuing a warrant to search Cambridge Analytica's servers. She has also asked Facebook to cease its own audit of Cambridge Analytica's data use.""Our advice to Facebook is to back away and let us go in and do our work,"" she said.Facebook has weathered many such blow-ups before and is used to apologizing and moving on. But the stakes are bigger this time. The latest scandal has some people reconsidering their relationship status with the social network, though there isn't much of anywhere else to go.

Cambridge Analytica said it is committed to helping the U.K. investigation. However, Denham's office said the firm failed to meet a deadline to produce the information requested.Denham said the prime allegation against Cambridge Analytica is that it acquired personal data in an unauthorized way, adding that the data provisions act requires services like Facebook to have strong safeguards against misuse of data.

Chris Wylie, who once worked for Cambridge Analytica, was quoted as saying the company used the data to build psychological profiles so voters could be targeted with ads and stories.Wylie has agreed to be interviewed by Democrats on the U.S. House Intelligence Committee. A date has not been set, and it's unclear if Republicans on the panel will attend.On Tuesday, Wylie said he found Facebook's reaction to the revelations bizarre. He told an audience at the Frontline Club in London that before the story broke, Facebook had agreed to work with him to improve its platform. But he said he was blindsided on Friday with a news release that identified him as a suspect in the case.Cambridge Analytica found itself in further allegations of wrongdoing. Britain's Channel 4 used an undercover investigation to record Nix saying that the company could use unorthodox methods to wage successful political campaigns for clients.In footage released Monday, Nix said the company could ""send some girls"" around to a rival candidate's house, suggesting that girls from Ukraine are beautiful and effective in this role.He also said the company could ""offer a large amount of money"" to a rival candidate and have the whole exchange recorded so it could be posted on the internet to show that the candidate was corrupt.Nix says in a statement that he deeply regrets his role in the meeting and has apologized to staff.""I am aware how this looks, but it is simply not the case,"" he said. ""I must emphatically state that Cambridge Analytica does not condone or engage in entrapment, bribes or so-called 'honeytraps', and nor does it use untrue material for any purposes.""

Nix told the BBC that the Channel 4 sting was ""intended to embarrass us"".""We see this as a coordinated attack by the media that's been going on for very, very many months in order to damage the company that had some involvement with the election of Donald Trump,"" he said.The data harvesting used by Cambridge Analytica has also triggered calls for further investigation from the European Union, as well as federal and state officials in the United States.On Tuesday, a dozen consumer-advocacy organizations pressed the Federal Trade Commission in the U.S. to investigate whether the release of data violated an agreement Facebook signed with the FTC in 2011 offering privacy assurances.The move comes after Bloomberg News first reported the FTC could already be investigating. The FTC hasn't confirmed the investigation but said it takes ""any allegations of violations of our consent decrees very seriously.""___AP Technology Writers Mae Anderson and Anick Jesdanun in New York and AP writers Mary Clare Jalonick and Richard Lardner in Washington contributed to this story.

        The Congress later appeared to have deleted the link to its app entirely on Monday, prompting Amit Malviya, the head of the BJP's IT cell, to tweet, ""What is the Congress party trying to hide?""The Congress responded on Twitter saying it was forced to remove the app as an incorrect link was being circulated and people were being misled.

The security researcher, who has previously highlighted some vulnerabilities in India's national identity card project and who tweets under the pseudonym Elliot Alderson, caused a flurry on Saturday with a series of tweets saying the Modi app was sending personal user data to a third-party domain that was traced to an American company.""Hi! My name is Narendra Modi. I am India's Prime Minister. When you sign up for my official App, I give all your data to my friends in American companies,"" wrote opposition Congress Party Chief Rahul Gandhi in a Twitter message on Sunday.The BJP responded on Twitter, saying Gandhi was trying to divert attention. The BJP has accused the Congress of engaging Cambridge Analytica in India, a charge the opposition party has denied.Alderson, who initially pointed out that the Modi app was sharing data with a third party without the consent of users, earlier on Sunday posted a new tweet saying the app had ""quietly"" updated its privacy policy after his previous tweets.Reuters could not independently verify Alderson's claims.Modi has not commented on the issue.(Reporting by Devidutta Tripathy and Euan Rocha; Editing by Nick Macfie)        Continue reading the main story

        WASHINGTON —  The U.S. Senate voted 94-2 on Monday to advance legislation to make it easier to penalize operators of websites that facilitate online sex trafficking, setting up final passage of a bill as soon as Tuesday that would chip away at a bedrock legal shield for the technology industry.The U.S. House of Representatives passed the legislation overwhelmingly last month. It is expected to be sent to and signed by President Donald Trump later this week.The bill's expected passage marks one of the most concrete actions in recent years from the U.S. Congress to tighten regulation of internet firms, which have drawn scrutiny from lawmakers in both parties over the past year because of an array of concerns regarding the size and influence of their platforms.The Senate vote to limit debate on the sex trafficking legislation came as Facebook endured withering scrutiny over its data protection practices after reports that political analytics firm Cambridge Analytica harvested the private data on more than 50 million Facebook users through inappropriate means.

Several major internet companies, including Facebook and Alphabet's Google, have been reluctant in the past to support any congressional effort to dent what is known as Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, a decades-old law that protects them from liability for the activities of their users.

The legislation is a result of years of law enforcement lobbying for a crackdown on the online classified site backpage.com, which is used for sex advertising.It would make it easier for states and sex-trafficking victims to sue social media networks, advertisers and others that fail to keep exploitative material off their platforms.Some critics have warned that the measure would weaken Section 230 in a way that would only serve to help established internet giants, which possess larger resources to police their content, and not adequately address the problem.Republican Senator Rand Paul and Democratic Senator Ron Wyden cast the only no votes.(Reporting by Dustin Volz; Editing by Peter Cooney)        Continue reading the main story

DUBLIN — As Ireland prepares to vote in May on a referendum on whether to repeal its ban on abortion, anti-abortion campaigners can be seen rallying most weekdays on the streets of Dublin, outside Parliament, and at universities, news media buildings and the offices of human rights groups.They arrive wearing body cameras and bearing placards with graphic images of aborted fetuses.But not all of them are Irish.Of the eight members of the anti-abortion Irish Center for Bio-Ethical Reform who protested outside the offices of The Irish Times on a recent weekday, only three — including the group’s leader, Jean Engela — are Irish. The others include Americans and a Hungarian.“We try to be as multinational as the abortion industry, and they make no apologies for sending in their international affiliates to pontificate to the Irish people,” said Dr. Engela.

The protests — relatively small but highly visible here in the Irish capital — are an emblem of the strong emotions as the country prepares to vote in late May on whether to retain the Eighth Amendment of the Irish Constitution, which bans abortion in nearly all circumstances and was itself enacted by a referendum, in 1983. (Abortion was illegal before 1983, but the amendment made it even harder to terminate a pregnancy, even to save to mother’s life.)        Continue reading the main story

        To the age-old debates around abortion — including questions of when life begins and of women’s control over their reproductive rights — the referendum has added a new dimension of concern about potential outside interference in the vote.An ethics regulator recently ordered two abortion-rights groups, Amnesty International Ireland and the Abortion Rights Campaign, to return grants of $150,000 and $25,000 to George Soros’s Open Society Foundations. It said the money was a foreign political donation intended to affect the outcome of a referendum or election, and therefore banned.But so far it does not appear that any anti-abortion groups have been asked to return overseas donations, despite reports that money is being openly raised on their behalf, particularly in the United States.One American group, the Pro-Life Action League, told an Irish newspaper in 2012 that anti-abortion groups were raising hundreds of thousands of dollars to support Irish anti-abortion groups like Youth Defence, which has been linked to far-right movements in Europe.Youth Defence did not respond to a request for comment. The Pro-Life Action League’s executive director, Eric J. Scheidler, said that the remarks concerned American support for the Irish anti-abortion movement over several decades, and said his group had not raised money for the current campaign.The Irish Center for Bio-Ethical Reform, which picketed The Irish Times, receives foreign funding but claims to be exempt from government oversight. “We are an educational body,” Dr. Engela said.He denied that the protest had anything to do with the coming vote, and asserted that some of the volunteers were full-time activists with their own sources of funding.

Some commentators argue that anti-abortion groups are not being held to the same stringent standard as abortion-rights groups.Theresa Reidy, a political scientist at University College Cork, said that there was a long history of overseas interests taking sides in Irish referendums, particularly on issues like the European Union. Over the last decade, even as support for the abortion ban has waned, concerns about possible outside interference have risen, she said.Photo

            Siobhan Mullally, of the Irish Center for Human Rights at the National University of Ireland, Galway, said the problem of undeclared foreign funding went beyond the abortion debate, and was “also a question about how charities are funded in general.”The Roman Catholic Church, long a major power in Ireland, was the main driver in the 1983 referendum. The church also opposed, successfully, a referendum in 1986 that would have legalized divorce. In the decades since, however, its social and moral authority has been gravely weakened by a number of scandals, most notably clerical child sex abuse.The church could not prevent the legalization of contraception and was on the losing side in referendums that legalized divorce in 1995 and same-sex marriage in 2015.

As a result, today’s anti-abortion activists are less overtly religious in their arguments. Instead, they are turning to arguments that abortion harms women’s health. They are also turning to social media tools.After recent revelations about the misuse of Facebook data to sway Britain’s referendum on European Union membership in 2016, and the United States presidential election later that year, fears are growing similar tactics might be used in the referendum campaign.The Save the 8th Campaign, an anti-abortion group, has hired Kanto Systems, a London-based political consultancy, to help run its campaign.Kanto Systems’s founder, Thomas Borwick, was chief technology officer for the Vote Leave campaign in Britain, and developed a canvassing app for Cambridge Analytica, the data-mining organization that exploited Facebook data on behalf of the 2016 Trump campaign.

Mr. Borwick said that he himself had not worked for the Trump campaign, and referred a reporter to a statement from Save the 8th, which said that Kanto would be performing “some data analytics for us” but would not be engaged in “any voter profiling or voter targeting.”John McGuirk, a spokesman for Save the 8th, said that in the Irish electoral system, which does not have online voter rolls, individually targeted advertising of the sort practiced by Cambridge Analytica would not be possible. “In terms of targeting advertising at individual voters, we couldn’t do that even if we wanted to, which we don’t,” he said.The Times of London reported that the Pro Life Campaign, Ireland’s largest umbrella anti-abortion group, has retained uCampaign, a Washington firm that has developed apps for the Trump campaign, the National Rifle Association, the Republican National Committee and Vote Leave. (Neither uCampaign nor the Pro Life Campaign responded to requests for comment.)The Transparent Referendum Initiative, a small group of Irish technology advocates, said it had already detected paid social media campaigns stealthily targeting Irish voters. This month, the group introduced a crowdsourced monitoring tool to detect and investigate anonymous or vaguely sourced paid advertising on Facebook. It has already identified 92 such ads relating to the Irish referendum, 55 with anti-abortion messages and 37 in support of abortion rights.Political advertising is banned on Irish television and radio, but the online world is a different matter.“There is no law against someone anywhere else in the world signing a commercial contract with a British company to use foreign money or unknown money, that is not going through any official regulated campaign, in order to influence an Irish vote,” said Liz Carolan of the Transparent Referendum Initiative. “There’s a serious vulnerability in our democratic system. And it’s now being exploited by incredibly sophisticated campaign techniques, and Facebook doesn’t have to tell us who’s doing it.”Responding to the Cambridge Analytica revelations, the Irish government announced last week that it planned to give Irish regulators new powers to curb external influence on Irish voters.A spokeswoman for Facebook’s Dublin office said that the company agreed with the need for more transparency in advertising, and that it was developing a new tool to help people identify paid ads in their timelines and to identify and label political content. However, she said, the tools will not be ready in time for the May referendum.

        AHMEDABAD, India —  Allegations that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's official smartphone app is shipping Indians' personal data to servers abroad have morphed into a political scandal in a country where privacy rules are weak and the data mining runs rampant.Indian opposition leader Rahul Gandhi taunted the prime minister after a pseudonymous researcher found that Modi's app was pumping private information such as citizens' email addresses to servers controlled by a U.S. firm.""Hi! My name is Narendra Modi. I am India's Prime Minister,"" Gandhi wrote in a sarcastic Twitter post published Sunday. ""When you sign up for my official App, I give all your data to my friends in American companies.""Modi's party has defended the app, saying the harvested data is being used ""only for analytics.""But the app's makers quietly rewrote their privacy policy after the news broke late last week. Initially , it read: ""Your personal information and contact details shall remain confidential."" Now it reads: ""Certain information maybe processed by third party services.""

Mark Zuckerberg at the company’s 2017 F8 Developer Conference in San Jose, Calif.CreditJustin Sullivan/Getty ImagesImageBy David LeonhardtMarch 21, 2018This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday.The election of Donald Trump was so shocking — and damaging to the country — that many people went looking for a scapegoat. There was a long list of candidates.Hillary’s flawed campaign. Bernie’s long campaign. The Electoral College. The media. Sexist voters. Racist voters. Economically anxious voters. Nonvoters. James Comey. Anthony Weiner. Vladimir Putin. Twitter. And Facebook.By spreading false news stories and giving a megaphone to Russian trolls, Facebook — a vastly larger social network than Twitter — played a meaningful role in the presidential campaign. Of course, so did many other suspects on the list. There was no single factor that allowed Trump to win. It was a confluence.If anything, the role of Facebook and its executives has sometimes been exaggerated. “Whatever role they played surely pales in relative importance to a whole host of other factors,” Ben Thompson, the author of the Stratechery blog, pointed out yesterday (in his subscriber-only newsletter), “and it makes sense that Facebook executives would feel persecuted on that front.”But, as Thompson explains, “The problem comes when arguing about details results in missing the big picture: fake news on Facebook may not have been the deciding factor many think it was, but Facebook’s effect on the news surely mattered.” And Facebook’s executives have indeed missed this big picture, claiming that their company played no significant role in Trump’s victory.That’s simply wrong, and the company’s defensiveness is one reason that its image problems are becoming significant.Facebook, as Vox’s Emily Stuart wrote yesterday, “is under siege from lawmakers, regulators, users, shareholders, and even its own employees amid revelations that Cambridge Analytics, a data analytics firm used by the Trump campaign in the 2016 election, secretly harvested personal data from 50 million of its users.”In a 2014 speech, Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s C.E.O., said, “In every single thing we do, we always put people first.” By that, he said he meant that Facebook would give people “control over how they share their information.”Facebook didn’t do that.“Where is Mark Zuckerberg?” asks Recode’s Kurt Wagner. “Facebook has dealt with these kinds of firestorms before,” Wagner writes. “But this time feels different. Users are fed up. Politicians are fed up. And investors are clearly concerned: Facebook just had its worst two-day stock performance since 2012, the year the company IPO’d. It has lost more than $50 billion off its market cap.”“It’s time” for Zuckerberg and other top Facebook officials “to come and testify,” Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said yesterday. Meanwhile, at the White House ... “This is depressing,” Matt Glassman of Georgetown University tweeted, referring to the story about Trump ignoring his national security advisers and cozying up to Putin on a phone call. “But boy, think about the atmosphere at the WH that leads to stuff like this leaking. Toxic.” In The Times. Kevin Rudd, the former prime minister of Australia, is an astute observer of China, and I recommend his new op-ed on Xi Jinping.

        (Reuters) - Facebook Inc's shares fell more than 4 percent in premarket trading after media reports that a political consultancy that worked on President Donald Trump's campaign gained inappropriate access to data on 50 million Facebook users.The move would knock $23.8 billion off the social network's market value of $538 billion (382.88 billion pounds) as of Friday's close and shares in other social media companies including Twitter Inc and Snap Inc also dipped in early deals in New York.One Wall Street analyst said the reports raised 'systemic problems' with Facebook's business model and a number said it could spur far deeper regulatory scrutiny of the platform.The head of European Parliament said on Monday that EU lawmakers will investigate whether the data misuse has taken place, adding the allegation is an unacceptable violation of citizens' privacy rights.

In January, when Facebook announced changes to its newsfeed which it said would hit user engagement in the near term, shares fell 4.5 percent in one day.""It's clear with more 'heat in the kitchen from the Beltway' that further modest changes to their business model around advertising and news feeds/content could be in store over the next 12 to 18 months,"" said Daniel Ives, research analyst at GBH Insights.He also argued that the issue was ""background noise"" on which Facebook could calm any regulatory nerves through further investments in security, ad content AI, improved content algorithms and screening mechanisms.No analysts had so far changed their price targets or recommendations on Facebook in response to the reports. Wall Street is largely bullish on the stock with 40 of 44 analysts recommending the stock ""buy"" or higher.

Now the intellectual underpinnings of the tech rally are being seriously tested.

Stocks in the best-known tech companies have plunged in recent days. The NYSE FANG+ index, which tracks the share price of 10 companies, including Facebook, Apple and Amazon, has fallen nearly 14 percent from its recent high. Given that the index has soared 50 percent in just the past 12 months, the recent decline could just be the sort of sell-off that punctuates any long-term rally.

        Still, several large tech companies suddenly face challenges that could undermine their ability to transform whole industries. And as we’ve seen after previous fervors, investors can take a long time to regain their faith.Facebook is down 20 percent from its recent high. Most of the slide came after news reports showing how the company’s data was misused. Investors have to grapple with the possibility that Facebook won’t be sharing as much data as it does, undermining its ability to generate ever-increasing amounts of advertising revenue.Nvidia, a computer chip maker intent on being a leader in automated driving technology, is off 12 percent from its recent high. The company said on Tuesday that it would halt tests of its autonomous driving technology on public roads after an Uber self-driving car hit and killed a pedestrian in Arizona.Tesla is not a tech stock, but it is included in the FANG+ index, and its supporters believe deeply in its power to revolutionize the auto industry. Growing fears about Tesla’s ability to finance its expansion have helped drag its stock down 33 percent from its recent high. Ominously, the price of Tesla’s bonds is also falling, signaling that the company is losing the confidence of creditors.Of course, on their march higher, tech stocks overcame obstacles, like management problems at Uber and the poor performance of Snap’s initial public offering.But the latest problems have raised deeper, broader doubts, and that may keep the uncertainty around longer. Investors have viewed automated driving technology as a huge potential source of growth for some companies. But after the Uber incident in Arizona, those companies may take a more realistic look at what they have to spend to create a technology that is efficient and safe, and conclude that they have to pull out of the race or pare back. Users of social media and regulators may prevent social media companies from sharing so much of their data with advertisers, and that could restrain revenue growth.And if the passion for two or three big tech companies wanes, the cooling may spread.— Peter EavisAmazon has shed more than $50 billion in market value.The reason?

Reports that President Trump wants to rein in the e-commerce giant.Jonathan Swan of Axios, citing anonymous sources, reported:“Trump has talked about changing Amazon’s tax treatment because he’s worried about mom-and-pop retailers being put out of business.”Mr. Swan added:“Trump’s wealthy friends tell him Amazon is destroying their businesses. His real estate buddies tell him — and he agrees — that Amazon is killing shopping malls and brick-and-mortar retailers.”Shares of Amazon have tumbled more than 7 percent at one point Wednesday, but they pared those losses after a White House official told Reuters there were no specific policy changes related to Amazon being considered at the moment. But the official added that the administration is always looking at different options on a range of policy issues.How concerned should investors be?GBH Insights analyst Daniel Ives writes:“While it’s now a hand holding time for Amazon given this new regulatory potential threat, we believe the reality of these worries altering the company’s business model and future tax structure are low and we would be buyers of the name on weakness.”Guess which companies are benefiting from Amazon's woes? Retailers, the FT points out.On a day when the stocks on Wall Street are flat, Macy’s was up 3.5 percent, J.C. Penney has gained 5.5 percent, Walmart rose 1.7 percent, Target increased 1.8 percent, and Kohl’s was up 2.4 percent.Photo

            Are investors waking up to Tesla’s real problem?The electric carmaker’s shares are down 7 percent Wednesday, after plunging 8 percent on Tuesday.Tuesday’s slide was driven, in part, by the National Transportation Safety Board’s announcement that it was investigating a fatal crash last week involving a Tesla vehicle in California. News that Jaguar Land Rover was teaming up with Alphabet Inc.’s Waymo unit probably didn't help either.But the continued decline in Tesla’s stock — its shares are down more than 20 percent since mid-March — speaks to the bigger concern surrounding Tesla: How it funds itself.Investors have grown increasingly worried as Tesla burns through cash and struggles to meet its own production goals for the Model 3. Late Tuesday, Moody’s downgraded Tesla’s credit rating further into junk territory and said its outlook on the company is negative. The credit ratings agency cited production delays and said Tesla may soon need to raise more than $2 billion.Those concerns can be seen not just in Tesla’s stock price but also in the trading of its debt. The FT points out that “Tesla’s eight-year bond maturing in 2025 traded on Wednesday at 87.6 cents to the dollar, the lowest since issuance. The yield has surged to 7.5 percent from 6.59 percent on Monday.”Liam Denning of Bloomberg Gadfly writes:“Challenges on the factory floor and the balance sheet are converging. Drawing inexorably closer to a refinancing wall, Tesla needs a real shot of confidence, and capital, to keep its money machine turning over this year.
“Given Tuesday’s bond blowout, that almost certainly means tapping the equity market again. Nothing like being a motivated seller to put a floor under a stock price, right?”Is Twitter vulnerable to privacy regulation?The fallout from Facebook’s Cambridge Analytica scandal has spread to Twitter.The stock tumbled 12 percent Tuesday after Citron Research’s Andrew Left said he was betting against the social media company because of its vulnerability to regulation around how it handles user data.

            Why the first Trump trade deal may not lead to othersPresident Trump has scored a significant trade deal with South Korea.But with Mr. Trump preparing to meet with North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un — who just took an armored train trip to Beijing — and the North apparently pressing on with nuclear developments, an “America first” trade stance was far from the only thing pushing the South to sign. More from Michael D. Shear and Alan Rappeport:The political success of the trade agreement — and its ability to be replicated in other negotiations — is not guaranteed. Many countries have reacted coolly to Washington’s pugilistic approach to trade, viewing the president’s preference to punch first and negotiate later as counter to global interests.The Trump administration continues to ramp up its trade rhetoric with China. Unidentified sources told Bloomberg that it is considering invoking an emergency law to restrict Chinese investments in sensitive U.S. tech. A separate plan to enact tariffs on $60 billion of Chinese goods has left companies wondering which industries will be targeted. Other Asian countries increasingly fear being caught in the crossfire of a trade war, the WSJ reports.And nations are already reacting to Trump’s trade moves, erecting  barriers to stop the steel and aluminum that faces tariffs in the U.S. being dumped in their markets.

The man who started all this, the Cambridge Analytica whistle-blower Christopher Wylie, spoke to British lawmakers on Tuesday and revealed that an employee of Palantir Technologies had suggested that Cambridge Analytica build an app to gain access to Facebook networks. Palantir was co-founded by Peter Thiel, who sits on the Facebook board.Separately, New Zealand’s privacy commissioner has accused Facebook of breaking a law by refusing to give a man information about him held in other users’ accounts.

            The self-driving slowdown continuesNvidia — the chip maker whose autonomous-vehicle technology is used by Volkswagen, Tesla, Audi and hundreds of other firms — said it would halt its own tests on self-driving cars, after an autonomous Uber vehicle struck and killed a pedestrian in Arizona. Its shares dropped 7.8 percent.Here’s Roger Lanctot, an automotive technology analyst with Strategy Analytics:Nvidia has no choice but to take steps in the context of the fear, uncertainty and outrage likely to be stimulated by a robot car killing a human being. This is precisely the type of event that is capable of slaying a nascent industry in the crib.Tesla also tumbled 8.2 percent, after the National Transportation Safety Board said it was conducting its second crash investigation of the year involving one of the company’s cars. There’s also anxiety about whether it will hit production goals.

        FRANKFURT —  Anyone tempted to #DeleteFacebook after the personal data of millions of users fell into the hands of a political consultancy is still likely to be monitored by the social network, which tracks nearly 30 percent of global website traffic.And Google, in various guises, shadows 64 percent of all web-browsing worldwide, a recent study (https://www.ghostery.com/lp/study) of 200,000 German users by Cliqz, using its anti-tracking product Ghostery, said.Neither Facebook nor Google responded to emails asking whether they viewed the Cliqz research as representative.A larger study (https://webtransparency.cs.princeton.edu/webcensus) of web trackers by researchers at Princeton University in 2016 produced similar results, with Google Analytics and other Google trackers taking the top five places, followed by Facebook.

        ""We prevent companies like this from spying on you,"" chief executive Marc Al-Hames told Reuters.From private browsers like Cliqz to anti-trackers and ad blockers, such firms seek to shield users from intrusion. Mainstream providers in Europe are also trying to differentiate themselves by stressing privacy.""Every time there is a scandal like this at the U.S. companies it boosts our business,"" Ralph Dommermuth, founder and CEO of Germany's United Internet, told Reuters. The company offers encrypted email services, hosted in Germany under its strict privacy laws, and does not sell users' data.United Internet and others recently formed a 'Login Alliance' offering a single, secure way for their 50 million users to give consent in compliance with new European Union privacy rules that enter into force in May.That contrasts with rampant use in the past of Facebook Login by companies to tap personal data.VOLCANIC ERUPTIONPrivacy advocates have warned for years that Facebook's terms of use left it open to data harvesting.Psychologist Aleksandr Kogan collected data on 50 million Facebook by creating a personality quiz taken by a few hundred thousand people. In consenting to its terms, they let the app collect information on their Facebook 'friends' - without their knowledge or consent.The U.S. academic passed that data to Cambridge Analytica, which applied data science and psychographic profiling to back Donald Trump's election campaign - violating Facebook's rules.

AdBlock Plus has 100 million users seeking protection from ads such as auto-play videos. It is not a privacy product as such, although users can tweak settings to increase protection.Most people do not mind normal search advertising, but object to intrusive third-party ads, Williams said.LOSS OF FACEBOOKThe Facebook leak shows that the data should never have been collected, Cliqz's Al-Hames said:""We should all be outraged but nobody should be surprised. Everybody who has data will eventually lose that data.""Cliqz has an icon that shows how many private data points trackers are trying to access when you visit a site.Its anti-tracking feature substitutes private data with random information to throw them off your trail, while there is also an anti-phishing feature to thwart data theft.Cliqz does store browsing history at the 'edge' - on desktops and smartphones – and uses this to personalize search.Without giving direct access, it also lets firms use that information to target adverts using its MyOffrz product in a way that complies with the new EU privacy rules.""We can deliver a targeted ad - but it doesn't mean that there is information about you on our servers,"" Al-Hames said.Cliqz has around half a million active users, while Ghostery, the browser extension that monitors which web servers are being called from a given page, has around 7 million users.

Here’s what we’re watching:• So you want to be Deutsche Bank’s next C.E.O...• Investors are selling tech again.• Will Wall Street’s top regulator keep going after bad bankers?• More potential limits on gun sales• Facebook’s growing political troubles• Uber’s self-driving travailsGet this in your inbox each morning. Sign up here.So you want to be Deutsche Bank’s next C.E.O...Imagine you are applying to be the C.E.O. of Deutsche Bank now that it’s reportedly seeking a successor to John Cryan, the bank’s current chief.You survey the bank’s numbers to get a sense of the opportunities and challenges you’d face.Staring you in the face is the stock price, down nearly 30 percent this year. Ugly, but it could be a good entry point. It gives you time to try out some tough measures aimed at improving Deutsche Bank’s performance. Even if those moves produce near-term losses, the stock may not dive, given how far it’s already fallen.

Then you look at the strength of Deutsche Bank’s capital, as expressed by a regulatory measure called the common equity tier 1 capital ratio. That’s at 14 percent, a solid-looking level, achieved in part by an €8 billion equity raise last year. In theory, you have something to spend on your chosen plans.

        But then you realize that Deutsche Bank’s share price is now back at the level at which the bank sold those shares. Shareholders must be livid. Not only that, Deutsche Bank’s stock market value is less than 40 percent of its net worth as stated on its balance sheet (its stock price is €11.30 and its book value per share is €30.16.) When a company trades at a hefty discount to its net worth, it either needs to raise a lot of new capital, which doesn’t seem to be the case at Deutsche Bank, or investors have serious doubts about the company’s business model.“So, I’ll rejig the bank’s business model,” you say to yourself, “that’s what new C.E.O.’s do!”You look for ways and stumble upon an unavoidable obstacle. Deutsche Bank is heavily dependent on Wall Street revenue, which can be far more unpredictable than revenue from other businesses. Last year, revenue from Deutsche Bank’s corporate and investment bank, which has struggled to keep up with its peers, accounted for 54 percent of the bank’s overall revenue. Compare that with JPMorgan Chase, whose investment bank accounted for a third of its revenue last year. And you are stuck with the Wall Street operations; no one wants to buy an investment bank with €1.2 trillion in assets.Maybe you can cut costs, another go-to tactic of an incoming C.E.O. Indeed, Deutsche Bank’s investment bank employees seem better paid than their counterparts at other firms. Going by a back of the envelope calculation, the unit’s compensation expense is equivalent to 44 percent of its revenue (excluding the interest the investment bank earns on its assets.) That’s higher than the 39 percent ratio for JPMorgan’s investment bank last year, and 41 percent for Goldman Sachs. Maybe you could slash the pay of bankers and traders.Sorry, Mr. Cryan tried that.— Peter Eavis

Investors are selling tech again.The roller coaster ride in tech continues.The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite tumbled nearly 3 percent, while the Dow Jones industrial average and the S.&P. 500 fell 1.4 percent and 1.7 percent.Tech companies in the S.&P. 500 tech sector slid 3.4 percent, the steepest decline among the index’s 11 main sectors.Chip makers were among the hardest hit on the day. Shares of Nvidia dropped 7.8 percent after it said it was halting tests on self-driving cars.

Nvidia’s slide weighed on the shares of rival chip makers. Micron Technologies fell 5.7 percent, and AMD dropped 4.2 percent.But semiconductor companies were hardly the only ones getting pummeled. The famed FANG stocks, among the biggest gainers over the past year, tumbled Tuesday. Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google-parent Alphabet all finished down more than 4.5 percent.Tesla tumbled 8.2 percent on news that the National Transportation Safety Board is conducting its second investigation this year into a Tesla car crash. The stock is off nearly 20 percent since March 12 on increasing concerns that the electric-car maker will fall short of its production goals for the Model 3.Twitter dropped 12 percent after Andrew Left’s Citron Research said it was shorting the social media company.Tuesday’s fall continued the recent volatility in American stocks, and specifically, the shares of tech companies. Enthusiasm about the technology sector had long propelled stock markets to new heights. But the specter of intensifying regulation of the industry has taken the sheen off. Last week tech stocks dragged the broader markets to their worst week in more than two years. The selling took a break on Monday as the S.&P. 500’s tech sector rose 4 percent pushing the index to its best day in almost three years.Photo

            Will Wall Street’s top regulator keep going after bad bankers?A vigorous debate is taking place over who should become the next head of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, a powerful regulator on Wall Street’s front lines.Contenders for the post should address one question: What will you do to clean up the culture at banks?William C. Dudley, the outgoing president of the New York Fed, had made improving the culture at the firms he oversaw a key initiative of his tenure of at the institution.

When Mr. Dudley took the helm in 2009, the financial crisis had left the New York Fed’s reputation as a regulator damaged. The institution had not done enough to address the severe weaknesses at the banks it oversaw, like Citigroup. Early on, Mr. Dudley commissioned a review of the New York Fed’s bank supervision department and then overhauled it. But in 2012, JPMorgan Chase, also overseen by the New York Fed, suffered huge trading losses in what was known as the London Whale scandal. The New York Fed was faulted.Following the embarrassing London Whale imbroglio, Mr. Dudley used his bully pulpit to focus on bankers’ ethics. Banks were stronger financially, but recent scandals showed that the culture of their firms still needed to improve, he observed. And if a cleanup didn’t occur, it may be a sign that they needed to be reduced in size, Mr. Dudley said in a 2014 speech that rattled Wall Street.The next big banking scandal — Wells Fargo’s widespread mistreatment of customers, which came to light in 2016 – strongly supported Mr. Dudley’s arguments. Wells Fargo was considered one of the most stable “too big to fail” banks, with its focus on plain vanilla lending, but in fact, its retail sales culture had degraded. The Fed earlier this year slapped relatively harsh sanctions on the bank, including a limit on its size.The example of Wells Fargo is pertinent for John C. Williams, a top candidate to replace Mr. Dudley. Mr. Williams is head of the San Francisco Fed, which oversees Wells Fargo.And there is still work to do to fulfill Mr. Dudley’s initiative. He proposed a “database of banker misconduct,” similar to the one for brokers, that would track a banker’s record on ethics and compliance. Banks could consult it before hiring. But this idea has not taken off. In a speech at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce on Monday, Mr. Dudley explained why: “Understandably, firms are concerned about legal risk if they share information about banker misconduct, but there may be ways to address these concerns through legislation.”Mr. Dudley had also pressed banks’ boards of directors to focus on ethical culture. On Monday, he said the boards had set up separate committees to focus on culture and conduct. “We’ve made part of the journey but I think more could be done,” Mr. Dudley said. Whether it will, depends on who steps into his shoes.— Peter EavisHow worrying is the flattening yield curve?The yield curve is near its flattest level since the financial crisis. The difference between the yields on the two-year and 10-year Treasury notes is at 0.52 percentage points, not far off its post-crisis low of 0.50 percentage points hit in January.That has some asking if the nine-year-old economic recovery is at risk.Since the end of World War II, no barometer has done a better job of predicting a recession than the yield curve. A flattening yield curve tends to indicate slowing economic growth in the near future. But what is more worrisome is if the yield curve goes beyond flattening and into outright inversion.

The chances of a recession when the yield curve is flattening is just 20 percent, according to the calculations of Jim Paulsen, the chief investment strategist at the Leuthold Group. That jumps to 72 percent when the curve inverts.“Unless the yield curve actually inverts, however, the probability of recession remains quite low. While a flatter curve may have implications for the pace of future economic growth, it does not materially raise recession risk.”There is another reason not to be too concerned about a flattening yield curve, and it has to do with the actions of central banks around the world. The unprecedented stimulus from the Fed, Bank of Japan and E.C.B. have brought down long-term rates. That means the yield curve might not be the predictor it once was.

Nvidia halts tests on self-driving cars.A week after a self-driving Uber vehicle hit and killed a woman in Arizona, the fallout continues to spread.Nvidia on Tuesday said it had suspended self-driving tests in New Jersey, Santa Clara, Japan and Germany. A Nvidia spokesperson said in a statement, using A.V. as an abbreviation for automated vehicles :“Ultimately A.V.s will be far safer than human drivers, so this important work needs to continue. We are temporarily suspending the testing of our self-driving cars on public roads to learn from the Uber incident. Our global fleet of manually driven data collection vehicles continue to operate.”Nvidia’s artificial intelligence platform is the autonomous industry’s leader. The chip maker has partnered with auto makers such as Volkswagen, Tesla and Audi. Around 320 firms - from software developers, automakers and their suppliers, sensor and mapping companies - use Nvidia’s platform, Reuters reports.Nvidia is just the latest company to halt tests on self-driving cars in the wake of the accident in Arizona. Toyota, nuTonomy and Uber have all already done so.Roger Lanctot, an automotive technology analyst with Strategy Analytics, wrote:“Nvidia has no choice but to take steps in the context of the fear, uncertainty and outrage likely to be stimulated by a robot car killing a human being. This is precisely the type of event that is capable of slaying a nascent industry in the crib.”Photo

            How else banks can limit gun salesCitigroup became the biggest Wall Street firm thus far to take actions to limit gun sales. Others, like JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Visa and Mastercard, are studying options. (Bank of America and JPMorgan are two of the bankruptcy lenders to Remington Outdoor, along with Wells Fargo, which is the N.R.A.’s bank of choice.)In his latest column, Andrew suggests these new tactics:• Credit-card issuers and banks could give gun sellers who have announced restrictions on sales, like Walmart and Dick’s Sporting Goods, a special merchant category code. That could help financial firms decide with whom they want to do business.• Payment processors could geofence gun shows and enforce restrictions on transactions coming from those GPS coordinates.

Here’s what Citi’s C.E.O., Mike Corbat, told Andrew about his firm’s actions:He said had expected to hear from customers who planned to “take their Citi card and put it in a drawer or cut it up” — and that Citi had received such responses. But ultimately “the positives have significantly outweighed the negatives,” he said. For every negative note, he said, he has gotten many more “saying that ‘I’m moving everything I have to Citi as a response to this.’”Photo

            The heat on Facebook is rising, but do shareholders care?Where to begin? The company faces inquiries from the Federal Trade Commission, the Senate Judiciary Committee, several state attorneys general and the watchdog group Common Cause. And Britain’s Parliament asked Mark Zuckerberg to testify (he’s sending a deputy).Facebook’s stock overall is headed for its worst monthly performance in nearly five years. Yet the company’s shares recovered from another beating, closing up slightly yesterday. And just two analysts have “sell” ratings on the stock, compared to 44 who have “buy” ratings.In Cambridge Analytica news: Did a Brexit campaign group violate election laws by not declaring some of its spending with AggregateIQ, a digital marketer with ties to Cambridge Analytica?Critics’ corner: Nir Kaissar of Gadfly thinks that the big question is how many users value privacy more than having a Facebook account. Charlie Warzel of BuzzFeed argues the Cambridge Analytica scandal could lead to “a full-scale personal and public reckoning that looks at the way we’ve used the internet for the last decade.”

Is Amazon behind another health care deal?Bankers and deal lawyers may want to send some of their bonus to Amazon this year. M.&A. activity is running at record levels and concerns about the e-commerce giant have played a role in driving a number of the largest deals.The latest? GlaxoSmithKline’s decision to buy out Novartis’s stake in their consumer health joint venture, which includes Sensodyne toothpaste, for $13 billion.Amazon may not have been the main reason, but its impact on the pricing of consumer health products likely played a role.Historically, such products have lower margins than prescription drugs, but customers that keep coming back. Sales, though, are slowing, up just 3 percent over the past two years, half the rate of the previous two, according to Morgan Stanley. Price competition from online retailers like Amazon has some worried it could decelerate further.

That partly helps explain why Novartis was willing to exit the business.So why was Glaxo willing to pay up for the business?1) Starting this month Novartis had the right to require Glaxo purchase its stake in the joint venture. Doing the deal now removes uncertainty.2) The deal will allow its new chief executive to “get on with fixing GSK’s pharmaceutical division, which suffers from a relatively lackluster pipeline of new drugs,” writes Neil Unmack of Breakingviews. Shares of Glaxo have gained 6.3 percent.Photo

            A reality check on the White House’s tariff tacticsThe S.&P. 500 rose 2.7 percent yesterday, its best day in nearly three years (as President Trump would be happy to tell you). Maybe it’s because, as Peter Eavis writes, the president’s threats of a trade war with China might be merely negotiating tactics.More from Peter: According to this view, the tariff proposal was a jarring move partly aimed at getting China to see that the U.S. was serious about shifting trade terms. If China doesn’t show real signs that it will do more to open its markets, Mr. Trump could up the ante — roiling the markets again. But the White House’s more conciliatory tone yesterday after last week’s sell-off suggests there is not a strong desire for a full trade war.But remember that Beijing is firmly committed to its industrial policy, while the U.S. is equally adamant about letting American companies operate more freely in China. (Even if G.M. and Ford, who have joint ventures with Chinese companies, wouldn’t benefit from a lower tariff on U.S. car imports.) And Stephen Roach of Yale thinks that the U.S.-China trade deficit will keep widening.Elsewhere in trade: The U.S. is near a deal with South Korea, after winning concessions on steel exports and imports of U.S. cars. Betting on trade wars is risky. Hedge funds are taking refuge in southern European stocks. And the Western world’s economic institutions are being attacked from within.The political flyaround• White House lawyers are examining whether more than $500 million of loans to Kushner Companies may have violated criminal laws or federal ethics regulations.

        (Reuters) - Facebook Inc is giving users more control over their privacy by making data management easier and redesigning the settings menu, the company said on Wednesday, in the wake of a scandal over a breach that exposed the personal information of millions and was allegedly used by a political consultancy.The company also said it would propose in the coming weeks updates to the social media website's terms of service and data policy to better spell out what information it collects and how it uses it.The company has faced a global outcry after a whistleblower said that data from millions of users was improperly harvested by consultancy Cambridge Analytica to target U.S. and British voters in close-run elections.Facebook shares are down nearly 18 percent since March 16, when it first acknowledged that user data had been improperly channeled to Cambridge Analytica, eating away nearly $100 billion of the company's market value.

"33","Timeline: Facebook and Google Under Regulators’ Glare","AdvertisementTechnologySupported byTimeline: Facebook and Google Under Regulators’ GlareIn 2011, the F.T.C. first required a company to create a comprehensive data privacy program for consumers. Europe will soon take another big step.ImageMark Zuckerberg, Facebook's chief executive, speaking in Barcelona, Spain, on the eve of the Mobile World Congress there last year. In May, the European Union will put into effect the General Data Protection Regulation, a comprehensive privacy law.CreditDavid Ramos/Getty ImagesBy Natasha SingerMarch 24, 2018Over the years, regulators on both sides of the Atlantic have cracked down on Facebook and Google for privacy violations. But as the European Union prepares to introduce comprehensive new data protection regulation in May, European regulators have been stepping up investigations into tech industry data practices.MARCH 2011The Federal Trade Commission for the first time requires a company to institute a comprehensive program to protect consumer data privacy Google reaches a settlement with the F.T.C., which charged the company with using deceptive tactics and violating its own privacy promises to consumers. Google had enrolled Gmail users in its social network, Buzz, without effective ways for them to opt out of the service or limit the sharing of their personal details, the agency said. NOVEMBER 2011The F.T.C. goes after Facebook for exposing users’ informationFacebook agrees to settle charges by the F.T.C. that it deceived users by telling them that they could keep their profile information private and then repeatedly allowing it to be shared and made public.AUGUST 2012 The F.T.C. fines Google $22.5 million for Safari privacy violationsGoogle agrees to pay $22.5 million to settle F.T.C. charges that the company misled people who used Apple’s Safari browser by placing advertiser tracking codes, called cookies, on their computers after Google told them that they would be opted out of such tracking. Google also violated a previous settlement that prohibited it from misleading consumers over how they could control collection of their data, the agency said.SEPTEMBER 2012Facebook turns off facial recognition in Europe after complaints that the company failed to ensure user consentAfter an audit by Ireland’s data protection commissioner, regulators report that Facebook turned off its photo-tagging facial recognition feature for new users in the European Union and will delete facial template data it had already collected from users there. The commissioner’s office said Facebook had not sufficiently notified users or obtained their explicit consent to use the feature.May 2017 The European Commission fines Facebook $122 million, saying the social network misled regulators about WhatsAppThe European Commission fines Facebook $122 million for misleading regulators during their investigation of the company’s acquisition of the WhatsApp messaging service. The commission, the executive arm of the European Union, says Facebook told regulators that it would be unable to automatically match an individual user’s Facebook account with his or her WhatsApp account. But WhatsApp later announced that it would begin sharing user data with Facebook.In December, the French Data Protection Authority orders WhatsApp to stop sharing data with Facebook or face penalties. And in March, a German court bars Facebook from using data from German users of WhatsApp for Facebook’s own purposes, upholding the ruling of a lower court.DECEMBER 2017German antitrust regulators censure Facebook’s data practicesIn a preliminary finding, Germany’s Cartel Office reports that Facebook has abused its dominant position in the country by requiring users to allow it to endlessly amass data by tracking them through other online services. In February, the regulator says it planned to investigate whether the ability of large platforms like Facebook and Google to set up closed advertising systems and have access to user data was limiting market competition.FEBRUARY 2018 A Belgian court tells Facebook to stop tracking users around the webA court in Belgium rules that Facebook must stop tracking users on third-party sites and delete the data it had already collected. The court says Facebook hadn’t sufficiently informed users about the data it gathered on their use of sites outside the social network or how it used that data.  May 2018 A sweeping data privacy law is set to take effect in Europe, reshaping data collection practices  The European Union will put into effect a comprehensive privacy law, called the General Data Protection Regulation, that requires companies to obtain consent from users before processing their data and allows the authorities to fine companies up to 4 percent of their annual revenue if they fail to comply.Natasha Singer is a business reporter covering health technology, education technology and consumer privacy.  @natashanytA version of this article appears in print on , on Page A26 of the New York edition with the headline: Feeling Regulators’ Glare  On Both Sides of the Atlantic.

        NEW YORK —  Mozilla, Tesla and other companies are distancing themselves from Facebook following revelations of a major leak of user data to political consultants associated with the 2016 Trump campaign.While the actions will not likely be permanent and won't have much of an effect on Facebook's bottom line, they're the latest fallout the social-media giant has to contend with from the ever-spiraling scandal — along with a tumbling stock price and a #deletefacebook movement.""We're taking a break from Facebook,"" Mozilla said in a blog post on Wednesday. The company, which created the Firefox web browser, said it is ""pressing pause"" on its Facebook advertising and won't be posting on its Facebook page. But it did not delete its page and said it will consider returning if Facebook takes stronger actions to protect users' data and improves privacy settings.German bank Commerzbank also said it was putting Facebook advertising ""on hold"" as it evaluates data security. And Sonos, which makes speakers and other electronics, said it is pulling advertising from Facebook, Instagram, Google, and Twitter for a week.

        While the actions are likely temporary, they're one more piece of the growing headache for Facebook since news of the leak broke a week ago. It has faced criticism because CEO Mark Zuckerberg and COO Sheryl Sandberg did not speak out until five days after the story broke. The company's stock price shed 14 percent of its value this week. And the grumblings by users, and now, businesses shows no sign of abating.

""The Cambridge Analytica scandal, like many recent headlines coming out of Silicon Valley, raises questions about whether Big Tech is doing enough to balance its own interests with one of its biggest responsibilities: safeguarding your privacy,"" Sonos wrote in a blog post.But Facebook downplayed the actions by the businesses.""Most of the businesses we've spoken with this week are pleased with the steps we've outlined to better protect people's data, and they have confidence that we'll respond to these challenges and become a better partner and company as a result,"" the company said in a statement when asked about the advertiser defection.The fact is, most advertisers need Facebook as a platform because its reach is so great, so any break is likely to only be temporary, said Allen Adamson, founder of brand-marketing consultancy Metaforce.""Companies can take a short-term hiatus to get some positive spin in the market, but there's no other alternative for digital marketing today,"" he said.

        WASHINGTON —  U.S. lawmakers on Friday formally asked Facebook Inc's Mark Zuckerberg to explain at a congressional hearing how 50 million users' data got into the hands of political consultancy Cambridge Analytica.The world's largest social media network is under growing pressure from governments, investors and advertisers. This follows allegations by a whistleblower that British political consultancy Cambridge Analytica improperly accessed users' information to build profiles on American voters that were later used to help elect U.S. President Donald Trump in 2016.""The hearing will examine the harvesting and sale of personal information from more than 50 million Facebook users, potentially without their notice or consent and in violation of Facebook policy,"" chairman Representative Greg Walden, a Republican who chairs the panel, and Frank Pallone, the top Democrat, and other committee leaders wrote in the letter.The House Energy and Commerce Committee did not say when they planned the hearing but it will not happen until Congress returns from a two-week recess.

        A Facebook spokesman confirmed the company had received the House letter and was reviewing it, but did not say whether or not Zuckerberg would agree to testify.Separately, the leaders of the U.S. Senate Commerce Committee also asked Zuckerberg to testify. Senator John Thune, the committee chairman, and Bill Nelson, the top Democrat, said the committee would work with Facebook ""to find a suitable date for Mr. Zuckerberg to testify in the coming weeks.""Facebook executives spent Wednesday and Thursday on Capitol Hill briefing congressional committee staffers.

Two senators also asked the Federal Trade Commission, the leading U.S. consumer regulator, to investigate if other firms improperly obtained user data from Facebook users. The FTC is reviewing whether Facebook violated a 2011 consent decree it reached with the authority over its privacy practices, a person briefed on the matter told Reuters this week.Zuckerberg apologized on Wednesday for the mistakes his company had made and promised to restrict developers' access to user information as part of a plan to protect privacy.His apology has failed to appease investors and advertisers.Facebook shares fell on Friday, although not at the pace of earlier in the week. After opening higher, they were down 1.6 percent at $162, and have fallen around 12 percent since last Friday. The company has lost more than $50 billion in market value since the allegations surfaced.Advertisers Mozilla and German bank Commerzbank have suspended ads on the service and the hashtag #DeleteFacebook remained popular online.On Friday, electric carmaker Tesla Inc's and its rocket company SpaceX's Facebook pages - each with more than 2.6 million followers - were deleted after Chief Executive Elon Musk promised to do so.""I didn't realize there was one. Will do,"" Musk wrote on Twitter, responding to a person urging him to delete the SpaceX page. The Tesla page was taken down shortly afterwards. ""Definitely. Looks lame anyway,"" Musk tweeted.

        SAN FRANCISCO/ FRANKFURT —  Facebook faces substantial business risks from new European Union privacy rules set to take effect in May, a looming reality that came into stark relief over the weekend with revelations that a controversial political consulting firm had improperly obtained personal data on 50 million Facebook users.Privacy experts said the disclosure that a researcher had  sold Facebook data collected via a personality quiz to the consulting firm Cambridge Analytica is a prime example of the kinds of practices that the new General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, is supposed to prevent or punish.The danger faced by Facebook going forward is two-fold: Complying with the rules means letting European users opt out of the highly targeted online ads that have made Facebook a money machine. Violating GDPR mandates could subject the California company to fines of up to 4 percent of annual revenues.Had the Cambridge Analytica incident happened after GDPR becomes law on May 25, it ""would have cost Facebook 4 percent of their global revenue"", said Austrian privacy campaigner and Facebook critic Max Schrems. Because a UK company was involved and because at least some of the people whose data was misused were almost certainly European, GDPR would have applied.

        Schrems first raised concerns in 2011 about how easy it would be for third-party apps to harvest data from the unwitting friends of Facebook users. Facebook says it has tightened its controls on such practices since it discovered the alleged abuses by Cambridge Analytica in 2015.Schrems has founded a non-profit, called None Of Your Business (NOYB), that is hiring lawyers and exploring avenues for ""strategic litigation"" over GDPR privacy violations.According to whistleblower Christopher Wylie, who formerly worked with Cambridge Analytica, the consulting firm used the data to help then-U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump to predict and influence choices at the ballot box.“The fact of the matter is that Facebook lost control of the data and wasn't adequately monitoring what third-parties were doing,"" said Scott Vernick, a partner and an expert in privacy and data security at the Philadelphia law firm Fox Rothschild.Vernick said the maximum GDPR fine could come into play in an incident like this because of the number of users affected and what appears to have been inadequate monitoring of third-party data practices.Facebook said it changed its policies in 2014 to ""to give much less data, especially about friends,"" Facebook Vice President Andrew Bosworth said in a Facebook post on Monday.""We conduct a robust review to identify potential policy violations and to assess whether the app has a legitimate use for the data,"" the company said on Monday. ""We actually reject a significant number of apps through this process.”

Compliance with GDPR rules could cost Facebook a significant amount of money. Deutsche Bank analysts in January estimated that Facebook’s overall revenue could be lowered by 4 percent in a scenario in which 30 percent of EU users opt out of targeted ads, reducing the effectiveness and likely price of ads shown by 50 percent.The EU represents 24 percent of Facebook's ad revenue, so multiplying those figures, the bank said the regulations could have a 4 percent impact on overall Facebook revenue.""If this regulatory approach spreads to other countries or if GDPR ever becomes more onerous over the medium or long term, it would pose more risk,"" Deutsche Bank warned.The firestorm over Cambridge Analytica has prompted a furious response from lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic, raising the prospect of just such an expansion of privacy protections.

Pivotal Research analyst Brian Wieser reiterated his 'sell' rating on Facebook after the weekend reports. Wieser expressed concerns that the company's regulatory risks would intensify and that its sophisticated use of data in advertising was in jeopardy.A December 2017 survey found that only 21 percent of European consumers know what GDPR is. But after the regulation was explained, 82 percent of respondents said they plan to exercise their new rights, according to the survey of 7,000 Europeans conducted by Cambridge, Mass.-based Pegasystems Inc, which makes sales and marketing software.PageFair, an Irish startup that helps websites deliver targeted ads without using personal data, estimates that only 3 percent of European social media users will opt-in to targeted ads, a potentially ""devastating"" blow for Facebook and other platforms, says Johnny Ryan, PageFair's head of ecosystem.GIVING CONSUMERS CONTROLThe quandary for Facebook is readily apparent from a video it began showing customers in February: it teaches people how to delete their accounts.GDPR gives users the right to access their data, delete it or transfer it to competing companies. Social networks will also need to regain Europeans' consent every time they want to use their data in new ways, including for targeted advertising.

Lawmakers had social networks in mind when drafting GDPR, said Helen Dixon, the data protection commissioner of Ireland, which is the lead GDPR regulator for numerous tech companies including Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn.""There was very big consideration of these newer types of platforms,"" she told Reuters.Tough European rules stand in sharp contrast to the lack of privacy regulation in the United States and many other countries, raising the prospect that Facebook will begin to look much different from one country to the next.For example, the social media giant in 2017 released new artificial intelligence features that detect when a user is at risk of suicide or when someone else uploads a picture of their face.The company did not make those features available in Europe. Facebook did not specify a reason. But heightened scrutiny in Europe over such practices with GDPR looming may have been a factor.Another challenge for social networks are GDPR provisions mandating how companies must obtain permissions. The regulation demands that requests for consent be presented ""in an intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language.""In other words, the days of extensive ""terms of service"" agreements written in small text will no longer pass muster in Europe, numerous data privacy lawyers told Reuters.In practice, social network users may find themselves seeing more ""permissions screens"" and being asked to check boxes every time a social network rolls out a new feature.That could depress usage, Facebook Chief Financial Officer David Wehner said at an investor conference last month.    ""Whenever you walk people through permission screens, there's some potential that people decide they're not going to use the product,"" Wehner said. ""We don't think it will be big, but there could be some implication there.""(This version of the story was refiled to correct description of PageFair's business in 19th paragraph)(Additional reporting by Foo Yun Chee in Brussels, and Paul Sandle and Eric Auchard in London; Editing by Jonathan Weber and Marla Dickerson)        Continue reading the main story

        Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa says the April 10 hearing will cover how consumer data is collected, retained and distributed for commercial use. He says the hearing also will examine what steps companies like Facebook can do to better protect personal information.Grassley's committee is the third congressional panel to seek Zuckerberg's testimony in the wake of a privacy scandal involving Cambridge Analytica, a Trump-connected data-mining company.Several Judiciary Committee members had pressed Grassley to hold the hearing.Grassley says he's also invited Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey.___12:15 p.m.The chief law enforcement officers for 37 U.S. states and territories are demanding to know when Facebook learned of a huge breach of privacy protections.The officers say in a letter Monday to CEO Mark Zuckerberg that users' trust in the social media platform is ""broken.""The attorneys general are asking how Facebook monitored what these developers did with all the data they collected and whether Facebook had safeguards to prevent misuse.They also asked Zuckerberg for an update on how Facebook will allow users to more easily control the privacy of their accounts.

___11:55 a.m.Germany's justice minister says she wants closer oversight of companies such as Facebook, following a meeting with executives about the abuse of users' private data.Katarina Barley says Facebook representatives assured her Monday that such breaches wouldn't occur again and pledged to inform those users who were affected.She added that ""promises aren't enough, though. We will need to monitor companies such as Facebook much more strictly in future and also punish breaches of data protection strongly, swiftly and painfully.""Barley said Facebook reacted ""favorably"" to her demand for greater transparency about the algorithms that underpin the company's data collection.She said campaigns such as ""Delete Facebook"" would likely make a strong impression on the company because ""in the end the currency that Facebook works with is trust.""___10:50 a.m.The Federal Trade Commission is investigating Facebook's privacy practices following a week of privacy scandals including whether the company engaged in ""unfair acts"" that cause ""substantial injury"" to consumers.Facebook's stock, which already took a big hit last week, plunged as a result.Facebook said in a statement on Monday that the company remains ""strongly committed"" to protecting people's information and that it welcomes the opportunity to answer the FTC's questions.News outlets have reported on the FTC investigation last week, but the FTC hadn't confirmed it until Monday. Facebook reached a settlement with the FTC in 2011 offering privacy assurances.___5 a.m.Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is promising to do a better job protecting user data following reports that a political consultant misused the personal information of millions of the company's subscribers. The fact is, European regulators are already forcing him to do so.

A similar data breach in the future could make Facebook liable for fines of more than $1.6 billion under the European Union's new General Data Protection Regulation, which will be enforced from May 25. The rules, approved two years ago, also make it easier for consumers to give and withdraw consent for the use of their data and apply to any company that uses the data of EU residents, no matter where it is based.

        NEW YORK —  To get an idea of the data Facebook collects about you, just ask for it. You'll get a file with every photo and comment you've posted, all the ads you've clicked on, stuff you've liked and searched for and everyone you've friended — and unfriended — over the years.Now, the company is under fire for collecting data on people's phone calls and text messages if they used Android devices. While Facebook insists users had to specifically agree, or opt in, to have such data collected, at least some users appeared surprised.Facebook's trove of data is used to decide which ads to show you. It also makes using Facebook more seamless and enjoyable — say, by determining which posts to emphasize in your feed, or reminding you of friends' birthdays.Facebook claims to protect all this information, and it lays out its terms in a privacy policy that's relatively clear and concise. But few users bother to read it. You might be surprised at what Facebook's privacy policy allows — and what's left unsaid.

Facebook's privacy practices have come under fire after a Trump-affiliated political consulting firm, Cambridge Analytica, got data inappropriately from millions of Facebook users. While past privacy debacles have centered on what marketers gather on users, the stakes are higher this time because the firm is alleged to have created psychological profiles to influence how people vote or even think about politics and society.

        Facebook defends its data collection and sharing activities by noting that it's adhering to a privacy policy it shares with users. Thanks largely to years of privacy scandals and pressure from users and regulators, Facebook also offers a complex set of controls that let users limit how their information is used — to a point.You can turn off ad targeting and see generic ads instead, the way you would on television or in a newspaper. In the ad settings, you'd need to uncheck all your interests, interactions with companies and websites and other personal information you don't want to use in targeting. Of course, if you click on a new interest after this, you'll have to go back and uncheck it in your ad preferences to prevent targeting. It's a tedious task.As Facebook explains, it puts you in target categories based on your activity. So, if you are 35, live in Seattle and have liked an outdoor adventure page, Facebook may show you an ad for a mountain bike shop in your area.But activity isn't limited to pages or posts you like, comments you make and your use of outside apps and websites.

""If you start typing something and change your mind and delete it, Facebook keeps those and analyzes them too,"" Zeynep Tufekci, a prominent techno-sociologist, said in a 2017 TED talk.And, increasingly, Facebook tries to match what it knows about you with your offline data, purchased from data brokers or gathered in other ways. The more information it has, the fuller the picture of you it can offer to advertisers. It can infer things about you that you had no intention of sharing — anything from your ethnicity to personality traits, happiness and use of addictive substances, Tufekci said.These types of data collection aren't necessarily explicit in privacy policies or settings.What Facebook does say is that advertisers don't get the raw data. They just tell Facebook what kind of people they want their ads to reach, then Facebook makes the matches and shows the ads.Apps can also collect a lot of data about you, as revealed in the Cambridge Analytica scandal. The firm got the data from a researcher who paid 270,000 Facebook users to complete a psychological profile quiz back in 2014. But the quiz gathered information on their friends as well, bringing the total number of people affected to about 50 million.

Facebook says Cambridge Analytica got the data inappropriately — but only because the app said it collected data for research rather than political profiling. Gathering data on friends was permitted at the time, even if they had never installed the app or given explicit consent.Ian Bogost, a Georgia Tech communications professor who built a tongue-in-cheek game called ""Cow Clicker"" in 2010, wrote in The Atlantic recently that abusing the Facebook platform for ""deliberately nefarious ends"" was easy to do then. What's worse, he said, it was hard to avoid extracting private data.If ""you played Cow Clicker, even just once, I got enough of your personal data that, for years, I could have assembled a reasonably sophisticated profile of your interests and behavior,"" he wrote. ""I might still be able to; all the data is still there, stored on my private server, where Cow Clicker is still running, allowing players to keep clicking where a cow once stood.""Facebook has since restricted the amount of types of data apps can access. But other types of data collection are still permitted. For this reason, it's a good idea to check all the apps you've given permissions to over the years. You can also do this in your settings.        Continue reading the main story

The Reader Center is one way we in the newsroom are trying to connect with you, by highlighting your perspectives and experiences and offering insight into how we work.Last weekend, Alyssa Severson, a member of our Reader Center Facebook Group, posed a question to her fellow group members: “Are you emotionally affected by the news? Sometimes reading about politics, human rights infringements, war zones, etc. can make me feel anxious or hopeless in a big way. What are some coping strategies you employ?”Coincidentally, a story published the same day profiled an Ohio man who has unplugged from news media entirely and describes himself as “bored” yet happy. But our roundup of reactions to the story suggested many readers don’t consider such a drastic solution acceptable.What’s the alternative? Reader Center Facebook Group members shared a mélange of ideas for keeping news-generated stress at bay. After you read them, tell us some of the ways you tackle this kind of anxiety.

Comments below have been condensed and edited for clarity.Alyssa Severson (Thailand): Sometimes I’ll put a moratorium on a certain subject if it’s bringing up really negative feelings. (Right now, no Myanmar ethnic cleansing articles!) Sometimes realizing how many things are wrong with the world gives me a serious existential crisis, but I think that’s just part of life when you care about others.

        Abby Leafe (Newtown, Pa.): How do I cope? I detach. And I remind myself that it’s a long game. Plus, I’m running for office!Stacie Birchett (Richmond, Va.): Outlander reruns.Marjie Gowdy (Callaway, Va.): I’ve watched La La Land more times than I can count.Jeffrey Itell (Vietnam): I read the news in the context that good “news” is happening always. I read The Times to find out when Mount Agung is spewing lava ... and not for the magnificent view it provides from Gili Trawangan. The Times reports the news, which includes important events I want to know about. But it doesn’t provide me a complete snapshot of the world.Shasta Gaughen (Escondido, Ca.): When it gets to be too much, I’ll delete my sources without reading and take a timeout. Cats help. And ice cream. Lots of ice cream. Here’s one of my cats encouraging me to take a break.Photo

            Elaine Tanzman: Sometimes reading disturbing news will inspire me to contribute to organizations that I have forgotten about. For example, after reading about the Neo Nazi riots in Charlottesville, I donated to the Southern Poverty Law Center.Daniel Mainz (Brooklyn, NY): I’ve appreciated a couple of news sources that combine research and commentary with practical, actionable steps readers can take to make their voices heard. They are DCReport.org from Pulitzer winner David Cay Johnston and Lauren Duca’s columns in Teen Vogue. Yes, I admit it. Teen Vogue: I read it for the politics.Deb Amlen (New York Times crossword columnist): I do regular news fasts and have tried not to wallow on places like Twitter. Also, did you know that the crossword puzzle was originally run in newspapers as an escape from the news pages during World War II? It still allows readers to keep their brains sharp and talk about something other than world events.

Anna Núñez (Houston, Texas): Dealing with daily barbaric immigration news is part of my job (copywriter for America’s Voice). At the end of the day, baking and cooking soothes me and I was grateful for this recent NYT recipe that I highly recommend to calm you, too!Photo
    
            
    Fadi BouKaram (Lebanon): Thankfully, I’ve been reading Reader’s Digest since I was a kid. It might be perceived as cheesy, but the “positive news” in it is a good reminder that the frequency of what’s covered by media does not reflect the reality of how the world is.Deborah Suraya (New York City): Having dinner together with friends really helps because there is usually a lot of laughter, chatter, etc. I also follow comedians on Twitter/Instagram, not just pure news outlets.

Julia Lansford (from Russia; living in NYC): World can seem a horrible place at a glance. However, NYT has a great project: The Week in Good News. When down from all the negativity, I also remember that dialogue between Frodo and Sam Gamgee in Peter Jackson’s “The Lord of the Rings”:FRODO: What are we holding on to, Sam?SAM: That there’s some good in this world, Mr. Frodo. And it’s worth fighting for.Alexandra Velasco (Queens, NY): I’m a democrat and, at the time, I couldn’t understand why anyone would vote for Trump. But since he got elected, I’ve been fascinated by reasons why people voted for him, and have been trying to find some understanding in their reasoning. Trying to understand people with different viewpoints has helped me cope.

I don’t need to tell you that something is wrong with social media.You’ve probably experienced it yourself. Maybe it’s the way you feel while scrolling through your Twitter feed — anxious, twitchy, a little world weary — or your unease when you see a child watching YouTube videos, knowing she’s just a few algorithmic nudges away from a rabbit hole filled with lunatic conspiracies and gore. Or maybe it was this month’s Facebook privacy scandal, which reminded you that you’ve entrusted the most intimate parts of your digital life to a profit-maximizing surveillance machine.Our growing discomfort with our largest social platforms is reflected in polls. One recently conducted by Axios and SurveyMonkey found that all three of the major social media companies — Facebook, Twitter and Google, which shares a parent company with YouTube — are significantly less popular with Americans than they were five months ago. (And Americans might be the lucky ones. Outside the United States, social media is fueling real-world violence and empowering autocrats, often with much less oversight.)But it would be a mistake to throw up our hands and assume that it has to be this way. The original dream of social media — producing healthy discussions, unlocking new forms of creativity, connecting people to others with similar interests — shouldn’t be discarded because of the failures of the current market leaders. And lots of important things still happen on even the most flawed networks. The West Virginia teachers’ strike and last weekend’s March for Our Lives, for example, were largely organized on Facebook and Twitter.The primary problem with today’s social networks is that they’re already too big, and are trapped inside a market-based system that forces them to keep growing. Facebook can’t stop monetizing our personal data for the same reason that Starbucks can’t stop selling coffee — it’s the heart of the enterprise.

Many of the fixes being proposed involve regulation. The Honest Ads Act, a bill in the Senate, would require greater transparency for online political ads. The European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation, which goes into effect in May, aims to give users greater control of their digital information trails.

        But these efforts don’t touch the underlying problems, and in fact could make it harder for start-ups to compete with the giants.If we’re really serious about changing how social networks operate, far more radical interventions are required. Here are three possible ways to rescue social media from the market-based pressures that got us here.Give Power to the PeopleIn their book “New Power,” which comes out next week, Jeremy Heimans and Henry Timms write about the struggle between centralized, top-down institutions, which represent “old power,” and decentralized, bottom-up movements, which represent “new power.”Facebook, they write, is an example of a new power institution that serves old power interests. It harvests the creative output of billions of people and turns it into a giant, centralized enterprise, with most users sharing none of the economic value they create and getting no say in the platform’s governance.Instead, the authors ask, what if a social network was truly run by its users?“If you’re contributing economic value to something of this much social consequence, you should share in the value you’re creating,” Mr. Heimans told me.Nathan Schneider, a professor of media studies at the University of Colorado, had a similar idea in 2016, when he proposed that Twitter users band together to buy the platform from its shareholders and convert it into a user-run collective, similar to the way a local credit union is run. People who made valuable contributions to the network, such as employees and power users, would receive bigger stakes and more voting power. And users would have a seat at the table for major decisions about the platform’s operations.It’s exceedingly unlikely that Mark Zuckerberg, who has fought hard to keep control of Facebook, will ever convert the company into a user-owned and run collective. But Mr. Schneider believes that giving more control to responsible users could help restore trust in the network, and signal the kind of values Mr. Zuckerberg says he wants Facebook to represent.

“He could show that he takes democracy seriously enough to start with his own baby,” Mr. Schneider said.

Create a Social FederationAnother radical approach would be to make social networks work more like email — so that independent apps could seamlessly work together with one another, across a common protocol.Instead of one big Facebook, a federated social network would look like clusters of independent nodes — Mombook and Athletebook and Gamerbook — all of which could be plugged into the umbrella network when it made sense. Rather than requiring a one-size-fits-all set of policies that apply to billions of users, these nodes could be designed to reflect users’ priorities. (A network for privacy hawks and one for open-sharing maximalists could have different data-retention rules, and a network for L.G.B.T. users and one for evangelical pastors could have different hate speech rules.) If a node became too toxic, it could be removed without shutting down the entire network.“Email is the most resilient social network on the internet,” Mr. Schneider said, “and the thing that allows it to adapt is that it’s an open protocol, and people build apps on top of it, and we evolve how we use it.”Versions of this kind of network already exist. Mastodon, a decentralized Twitter-like social network, has gotten more than a million registered users since its debut in 2016. And various social networks based on the blockchain — the ledger system that underlies virtual currencies like Bitcoin — have sprung up in recent months.To be sure, decentralized networks have their own problems. They’re messy to administer, and they can still be gamed by bad actors. They can also fall prey to the same kind of privacy issues that Facebook is being criticized for. (In fact, part of the reason users are angry at Facebook right now is that the company’s data infrastructure was too open, and made it overly simple for third-party app developers to take user information outside Facebook.)None of this is a panacea. But experimenting with more decentralized models could give social media users a sense that platforms represented their interests, rather than those of a faceless corporation.Put Expiration Dates on Social GraphsA single friend of mine once remarked that the major difference among dating apps like OKCupid, Tinder and Bumble wasn’t the way they were designed or the companies behind them — it was how long they had existed.

New apps, she said, were more likely to attract interesting and smart people who were actually looking for dates. Older apps, by contrast, were eventually overrun with creeps and predators, no matter how well built they were.A similar theory might apply to social networks. Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Instagram and Snapchat all had plenty of issues in their early years, but they were by and large cleaner, with fewer types of exploitation and malicious behavior. Today, the enormous size and influence of these platforms have made them irresistible honey pots for bad actors, and many of our “social graphs” — Facebook’s term for the webs of digital connections we create — are clogged with years’ worth of clutter.In a blog post last year, the venture capitalist Hunter Walk proposed an interesting idea: a legally mandated “start over” button that, when pressed, would allow users of social networks to delete all their data, clear out their feeds and friend lists, and begin with a fresh account.

I’d go even further, and suggest that social networks give their users an automatic “self-cleaning” option, which would regularly clear their profiles of apps they no longer used, friendships and followers they no longer interacted with, and data they no longer needed to store. If these tools were enabled, users would need to take affirmative action if they didn’t want their information to disappear after a certain number of months or years.Making social graphs temporary, rather than preserving them forever by default, would undoubtedly be bad for most social networks’ business models. But it could create new and healthy norms around privacy and data hygiene, and it would keep problems from piling up as networks get older and more crowded. It might even recapture some of the magic of the original social networks, when things were fresh and fascinating, and not quite so scary.
    
         Correction: March 29, 2018  An earlier version of this article misstated the number of registered users on Mastodon. It is more than a million, not more than 140,000.

A parade of regulators, politicians and law enforcement officials demanded to know more about Facebook’s privacy practices on Monday, as the fallout from the company’s relationship with a political data firm continued to spread.Early in the day, the Federal Trade Commission confirmed reports that it was investigating how Facebook handles information about its users.Soon after, Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa and chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, invited Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, to testify about privacy standards next month. He also extended invitations to Google’s chief executive, Sundar Pichai, and Twitter’s chief executive, Jack Dorsey.And a group of 37 attorneys general sent Mr. Zuckerberg a letter asking for details about Facebook’s privacy safeguards.

But one group of people interested in Facebook — investors — had a muted reaction to the growing regulatory threat. Shares of Facebook fell sharply after the F.T.C. confirmed its investigation but ended the day up 0.4 percent as overall trading on Wall Street recovered from a big drop last week.

        The federal investigation and threats followed recent news that the data collection firm Cambridge Analytica, which worked on the 2016 Trump presidential campaign, gained access to the personal data of more than 50 million Facebook users.The F.T.C. said it planned to determine whether the social media giant had violated a consent decree it signed in 2011 to protect users’ privacy.The decree required Facebook to notify and receive explicit permission from users before sharing their personal information beyond the limits dictated by their privacy settings. Each violation of the agreement, which the agency reached with Facebook as part of a settlement over third-party apps, carries a penalty of up to $40,000 a day.The agency’s acknowledgment of its investigation helped push Facebook’s stock down as much as 6.5 percent on Monday morning before it recovered. Facebook said last week that it was anticipating an inquiry by the agency.The F.T.C. said in a statement on Monday that it “takes very seriously recent press reports raising substantial concerns about the privacy practices of Facebook.”Lawmakers have repeatedly called for Mr. Zuckerberg to appear in hearings on Capitol Hill. Last week, the Republican and Democratic leaders of the House and Senate commerce committees formally invited him to testify.“I’m sure this is much bigger than Cambridge Analytica, and I’m sure there are other Cambridge Analyticas out there,” Senator John Kennedy, Republican from Louisiana, said in an interview. “Facebook isn’t just a company. It is so powerful it is like a country.”

Some lawmakers, such as Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat from Connecticut, asked the F.T.C. to look into whether Facebook should pay damages to users.“The sphere of scrutiny must be broader than just the consent decree,” he said in a statement. “There is no excuse for delay.”

Cambridge Analytica is facing intense criticism, too. On Monday, Common Cause, a government watchdog group in Washington, filed complaints seeking federal investigations into allegations that the company violated federal election law.In an article that detailed how Cambridge Analytica obtained information about millions of Facebook users, The New York Times reported this month that employees of the data research firm with European or Canadian citizenship had worked extensively for its American clients during the 2014 and 2016 elections, despite a warning from its own election lawyer.The employees worked on polling, message development, and the designing of target audiences for digital ads and fund-raising appeals.The company said the work was permissible because none of the foreign employees had “strategic” or “operational” roles. But former employees contradicted that account, suggesting that the work violated laws in the United States that strictly limit what non-Americans can do for American political campaigns.Common Cause filed one complaint with the Justice Department, which has authority to investigate “knowing and willful” violations of campaign law. The group also filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission, which has day-to-day jurisdiction over enforcing election rules.“It defies belief that even after their own attorney warned them that they would be violating the prohibition on performing certain election-related activities in U.S. elections that they did so anyway,” said Paul S. Ryan, Common Cause’s vice president for policy and litigation.In the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco, lawyers appealed two lawsuits that challenged the social media company’s privacy and user data policies. One lawsuit claims that Facebook violates the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (Wiretap Act) and state law equivalents because of the way it monitors its users on and off the platform.

The second suit claims that Facebook has been capturing and selling the details of users’ browsing of third-party health sites. Any site with a Facebook “like” button, including those of medical institutions such as the American Cancer Society and the American Society of Clinical Oncology, could be used to track users as they browsed outside Facebook, according to the lawsuit.Facebook also has been targeted by several shareholder lawsuits since the reports detailing Cambridge Analytica’s use of Facebook user information.Video


    
    Why Leaving Facebook Doesn’t Always Mean Quitting

        
            
                In the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, in which data from over 50 million Facebook profiles was secretly scraped and mined for voter insights, many Facebook users have decided to delete their accounts — but untangling yourself from a site like Facebook is not as easy as pressing “delete.”

    Many users have threatened to deactivate or delete their accounts to protest Facebook’s stewardship of their personal data. The #deletefacebook campaign, as it has been called, has even received support from a creator of WhatsApp, one of Facebook’s most popular services, who sold his company to the social media giant for $19 billion in 2014. Elon Musk, the chief executive of SpaceX and Tesla, removed the Facebook pages of both companies on Friday.While the Cambridge Analytica revelations have renewed regulatory interest in Facebook in the United States, pressure on the company in other countries has been building for years.The company has been the subject of several privacy investigations and charges by European regulators. And Europe has approved a new privacy law, which takes effect in May, that will give users of Facebook, Google and other internet services more control over how their data is collected and what Silicon Valley companies know about them.

 (Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.)Good morning.Here’s what you need to know:Facebook’s “trust issue”• Mark Zuckerberg, the social media giant’s chief executive, publicly addressed the crisis facing his company, five days after reports about the misuse of data from 50 million of its users.“We also made mistakes, there’s more to do, and we need to step up and do it,” he wrote in a statement outlining the steps Facebook would take to better protect users’ information. He also spoke to The Times about his plans for change.Given that the gathering of user data is fundamental to the company’s operations, lawmakers and researchers were unimpressed by Mr. Zuckerberg’s mea culpa: “He avoided the big issue, which is that for many years, Facebook was basically giving away user data like it was handing out candy,” a Columbia University researcher said.• Disillusioned Facebook users  have been leaving the service.

            Trump takes on China• President Trump has said the country is an “economic enemy” of the U.S. that has “taken advantage of us like nobody in history.”Today, he plans to announce tariffs on at least $50 billion of annual Chinese imports and to impose other penalties in response to the theft of technology and trade secrets. Previously announced tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, which will also affect China, go into effect on Friday.China’s staggering economic growth has indeed been propelled by unfair trade practices, but experts worry that the president’s go-it-alone approach undermines the potential for collective action.• On Wednesday, Mr. Trump appeared to endorse a $1.3 trillion spending deal reached by Congress. Lawmakers must approve the bill by midnight Friday to avoid a government shutdown. Trump lawyer for Russia inquiry resigns• President’s Trump’s lead lawyer for the special counsel investigation resigned today, according to two people briefed on the matter.The lawyer, John Dowd, who took over the president’s legal team last summer, had considered leaving several times and ultimately concluded that Mr. Trump was increasingly ignoring his advice, one of the people said.

• The president has said that he would agree to an interview with the office of the special counsel, Robert Mueller, but Mr. Dowd has said that was a bad idea.F.B.I. investigated Sessions• At the request of Congress, the bureau investigated Attorney General Jeff Sessions for possible perjury last year, after he inaccurately said that he had no contacts with Russians during the presidential campaign, according to three people familiar with the case.Andrew McCabe, the F.B.I.’s deputy director at the time, was said to have authorized the inquiry. Mr. McCabe was recently fired — by Mr. Sessions — for showing “lack of candor” in an internal investigation.• Separately, John Brennan, a former C.I.A. director and a pointed critic of President Trump, said that he thought Russia may have compromising information on the president. He later said that his opinion wasn’t based on inside knowledge.

Justice William Brennan held that the law violated the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment because it discriminated between married and unmarried people.The case became an important precedent for landmark rulings by the Supreme Court, including the 1973 decision in Roe v. Wade that recognized abortion rights, and, more recently, the 2015 decision guaranteeing a right to same-sex marriage.A movie about Mr. Baird’s case is in development.Mr. Baird has continued working as an activist, but his legacy is complicated by what The Times described in 1993 as an “unapologetic zealotry” and a willingness to criticize “even his ideologic allies.” Planned Parenthood once called him an “embarrassment.”Jillian Rayfield contributed reporting._____Your Morning Briefing is published weekdays and updated all morning.

        NEW YORK —  In the wake of a privacy scandal involving a Trump-connected data-mining firm, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg embarked on a rare media mini-blitz in an attempt to take some of the public and political pressure off the social network.But it's far from clear whether he's won over U.S. and European authorities, much less the broader public whose status updates provide Facebook with an endless stream of data it uses to sell targeted ads.On Wednesday, the generally reclusive Zuckerberg sat for an interview on CNN and conducted several more with other outlets, addressing reports that Cambridge Analytica purloined the data of more than 50 million Facebook users in order to sway elections. The Trump campaign paid the firm $6 million during the 2016 election, although it has since distanced itself from Cambridge.Zuckerberg apologized for a ""major breach of trust,"" admitted mistakes and outlined steps to protect users following Cambridge's data grab.

""I am really sorry that happened,"" Zuckerberg said on CNN. Facebook has a ""responsibility"" to protect its users' data, he added, noting that if it fails, ""we don't deserve to have the opportunity to serve people.""        Continue reading the main story

        His mea culpa on cable television came a few hours after he acknowledged his company's mistakes in a Facebook post , but without saying he was sorry.Zuckerberg and Facebook's No. 2 executive, Sheryl Sandberg, had been quiet since news broke Friday that Cambridge may have used data improperly obtained from roughly 50 million Facebook users to try to sway elections. Cambridge's clients included Donald Trump's general-election campaign.Facebook shares have dropped some 8 percent, lopping about $46 billion off the company's market value, since the revelations were first published.While several experts said Zuckerberg took an important step with the CNN interview, few were convinced that he put the Cambridge issue behind hm. Zuckerberg's apology, for instance, seemed rushed and pro forma to Helio Fred Garcia, a crisis-management professor at NYU and Columbia University.""He didn't acknowledge the harm or potential harm to the affected users,"" Garcia said. ""I doubt most people realized he was apologizing.""Instead, the Facebook chief pointed to steps the company has already taken, such as a 2014 move to restrict the access outside apps had to user data. (That move came too late to stop Cambridge.) And he laid out a series of technical changes that will further limit the data such apps can collect, pledged to notify users when outsiders misuse their information and said Facebook will ""audit"" apps that exhibit troubling behavior.That audit will be a giant undertaking, said David Carroll, a media researcher at the Parsons School of Design in New York — one that he said will likely turn up a vast number of apps that did ""troubling, distressing things.""

But on other fronts, Zuckerberg carefully hedged otherwise striking remarks.In the CNN interview, for instance, he said he would be ""happy"" to testify before Congress — but only if it was ""the right thing to do."" Zuckerberg went on to note that many other Facebook officials might be more appropriate witnesses depending on what Congress wanted to know.

At another point, the Facebook chief seemed to favor regulation for Facebook and other internet giants. At least, that is, the ""right"" kind of rules, such as ones requiring online political ads to disclose who paid for them. In almost the next breath, however, Zuckerberg steered clear of endorsing a bill that would write such rules into federal law, and instead talked up Facebook's own voluntary efforts on that front.""They'll fight tooth and nail to fight being regulated,"" said Timothy Carone, a Notre Dame business professor. ""In six months we'll be having the same conversations, and it's just going to get worse going into the election.""Even Facebook's plan to let users know about data leaks may put the onus on users to educate themselves. Zuckerberg said Facebook will ""build a tool"" that lets users see if their information had been impacted by the Cambridge leak, suggesting that the company won't be notifying people automatically. Facebook took this kind of do-it-yourself approach in the case of Russian election meddling, in contrast to Twitter, which notified users who had been exposed to Russian propaganda on its network.In what has become one of the worst backlashes Facebook has ever seen, politicians in the U.S. and Britain have called for Zuckerberg to explain its data practices in detail. State attorneys general in Massachusetts, New York and New Jersey have opened investigations into the Cambridge mess. And some have rallied to a movement that urges people to delete their Facebook accounts entirely.Sandy Parakilas, who worked in data protection for Facebook in 2011 and 2012, told a U.K. parliamentary committee Wednesday that the company was vigilant about its network security but lax when it came to protecting users' data.He said personal data including email addresses and in some cases private messages was allowed to leave Facebook servers with no real controls on how the data was used after that.Paul Argenti, a business professor at Dartmouth, said that while Zuckerberg's comments hit the right notes, they still probably aren't enough. ""The question is, can you really trust Facebook,"" he said. ""I don't think that question has been answered.""Cambridge Analytica headquarters in central London was briefly evacuated Thursday as a precaution after a suspicious package was received. Nothing dangerous was found and normal business resumed, police said.___AP reporters Danica Kirka and Gregory Katz in London and Michael Liedtke in San Francisco contributed to this story.

        NEW YORK —  After a jittery afternoon of trading, major U.S. stock indexes fell Wednesday while smaller companies fared better. The Federal Reserve raised interest rates, as investors expected, and said it could raise rates at a quicker pace next year.Stocks traded higher early in the day and jumped after the Fed announced its decision. The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 250 points, but gave it all up as new Fed Chairman Jerome Powell addressed reporters. At the end of trading it wobbled and ended lower. The dollar weakened and bond yields turned lower. Yields had risen earlier in the afternoon.The Fed said the U.S. economy and the job market continued to improve over the last two months. It still expects to raise interest rates three times this year, and said it might raise rates three more times next year instead of two.Brent Schutte, the chief investment strategist for Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management, said Powell is trying to tell Wall Street what the Fed's plans are without worrying investors too much. He said stocks dropped after Powell said rates might rise higher than the Fed expects.

""The market will have to get to know Jerome Powell a little bit and will have to test his credibility as Fed chairman,"" he said. ""I would imagine the bar is higher for him in the shorter term because he is not a trained economist,"" unlike Janet Yellen and other predecessors.

        Small and mid-size companies climbed. Energy companies led the way as oil prices jumped for the second day in a row. Homebuilders advanced following a report that sales of previously occupied homes increased in February. Cereal and packaged foods companies slumped after General Mills reported rising expenses and cut its annual profit forecast and airlines skidded after Southwest said its revenue is suffering as it cuts fares to compete with other companies.The S&P 500 index slid 5.01 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,711.93. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 44.96 points, or 0.2 percent, to 24,682.31. The Nasdaq composite fell 19.02 points, or 0.3 percent, to 7,345.29. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies gained 8.90 points, or 0.6 percent, to 1,579.30.Bond prices edged lower. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note declined to 2.88 percent from 2.90 percent Tuesday. It had risen as high as 2.93 percent as investors expected quicker gains in interest rates.David Kelly, the chief global strategist for JPMorgan Asset Management, said stocks usually do well when rates are rising, but only up to a point.""If interest rates are rising from a low level, there's more optimism about the economy, and that generally is a more positive thing,"" he said. That's the case right now, but with an important difference: the economy has been growing for almost a decade, and interest rates have been historically low for the whole time.Kelly added that the Fed and the government need to be careful to focus on smooth growth, as the recent tax cuts will dump some short-lived stimulus into the economy.""The overall effect of the tax cut is to deliver another keg to a keg party at 2 a.m.,"" he said. ""The party is probably going to go a little longer but the hangover is going to be worse.""

Good morning.(Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.)More than 10 years ago, Arnold Schwarzenegger, then the Republican governor of California, told an audience of conservative leaders that the California Republican Party had moved too far to the right and was “dying at the box office.”“How right I was,” Mr. Schwarzenegger said in a rare return public appearance on Wednesday. “The party was going down and down and down. Today we are the Titanic after it hit the iceberg — but before the last bit of the ship submerged.”Mr. Schwarzenegger was speaking at a youth center in East Los Angeles marking the start of an organization of moderate California Republicans trying to move the way-out-of-power state party to the center — and back, organizers said, into being a player in state governance. The organization is called New Way California and was put together by Assemblyman Chad Mayes, who was ousted as the Republican minority leader after voting with Democrats on extending the cap-and-trade automobile emission program.“We seek to shed the stereotype of the intolerant Republican Party that serves only the rich and big business,” Mr. Mayes said.

Mr. Schwarzenegger was not the only Republican firepower on stage: John Kasich, the governor of Ohio, who is considering challenging President Trump for the Republican nomination in 2020, was also on hand.        Continue reading the main story

        In Sacramento, the former governor — and occasional actor — broke with national Republicans (at least of today) when he championed environmental protection efforts, including stringent emission controls. In sentiments also reflected by Mr. Kasich and Mr. Mayes, Mr. Schwarzenegger said the Republican Party had to be “environmentally progressive, socially liberal and fiscally conservative” in order to be competitive.“Our party is giving them Twitter fights instead of answers,” Mr. Schwarzenegger said. “And it is sinking us. It is time to return to the issues.”“The politics of division and anger and resentment can drive a strong base to the polls, yes,” he said. “But it is tearing our country apart at the seams. And nothing is getting done.”

        “Whenever there’s an issue where someone’s data gets passed to someone who the rules of the system shouldn’t have allowed it to, that’s rightfully a big issue and deserves to be a big uproar,” Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, said in an interview.

            • Mark Zuckerberg on whether he’s concerned about Facebook users deleting their accounts. “I think it’s a clear signal that this is a major trust issue for people, and I understand that. And whether people delete their app over it or just don’t feel good about using Facebook, that’s a big issue that I think we have a responsibility to rectify.” Full interview.• You can quit Facebook if you simply find no joy in it. But if you’re looking to leave for philosophical reasons concerning privacy, it’s a futile effort. You may be better off tweaking your privacy settings on the site. [The New York Times]• Mayor Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles hasn’t made it official yet. But he visited New Hampshire last year and is traveling to Iowa in April.

[The New York Times]And Finally ...The Times reporter David Streitfeld had an article Wednesday on Facebook’s plans to build a community with housing and retail in its hometown, Menlo Park in Silicon Valley. But if reader comments are any indication, the project faces an uphill battle to acceptance.Many commenters referenced the escalating crisis over Cambridge Analytica and the company’s lax approach to privacy as reason enough to stay away. Facebook might have two billion users, but many are wary of living in Facebookland:• “That sounds great: a whole city full of ‘Ready Player One’ arrogant nerds closing ranks against reality. We can measure their success by the zeroed-out birthrate and the truckloads of Amazon boxes full of inflatable companionship.”

• “Much like smart speakers, this new model community is a Faustian bargain, where you sacrifice your personal privacy and private data rights in exchange for high-end centrally located conveniences all too willingly provided by a company whose sole intent is to monetize the details of your daily life by auctioning off your information to the highest bidder.”But a few readers celebrated the efficiency of Big Tech:• “I’ve been much more pleased with my dealings with Facebook — and Google, and Apple, and Amazon — than any city, county, or state government. I’ve gotten extreme value from tech, while I’ve mostly got waste, incompetence and corruption from government.”

Revelations that a voter-profiling company that worked Donald J. Trump’s presidential campaign harvested private information from 50 million Facebook profiles have many people wondering: What, if anything, can they do to protect their data connected to the social network?Here’s the harsh truth: Not much, short of ceasing to browse the web entirely or deleting your Facebook account.Yet there are some best practices you can employ to help safeguard your data, such as installing software to block web tracking technologies and carefully vetting the apps that you use on Facebook.But it also helps to understand what exactly happened with those 50 million profiles in order to determine how you can better protect your data. Here’s what you need to know.

So what happened?An academic researcher at Cambridge University built an app called thisisyourdigitallife, which offered to pay Facebook users to take a personality test and agree to share that data for academic use. About 270,000 people participated in the study — enough to extract information on tens of millions of Facebooks users.        Continue reading the main story

        How did Cambridge Analytica get data on 50 million people when only 270,000 people had agreed to hand over their information to a third party? Facebook said people who downloaded the app gave consent for the app to collect limited information about their friends whose privacy settings were set to allow it.That information was eventually paid for by Cambridge Analytica, the voter profiling company that worked with the Trump campaign.

O.K., so what do I do now?There is a multipronged approach you can take to protect yourself from data-harvesting apps and programs. That includes tools you can install in your browser and settings you can tweak on Facebook. Here’s a run down of what you should do:• Audit your Facebook apps. If you used Facebook to sign in to a third-party website, game or app, those services may continue to access your personal data. On Facebook, go to the settings page and click on the Apps tab to see which apps are connected to your account. From there, you can take a closer look at the permissions you granted to each app to see what information you are sharing. Remove any apps that you find suspicious or no longer use. (Facebook has also made some changes to prevent the gathering of detailed information of friends of users.)On the App Settings page there is another setting called Apps Others Use. This is where you choose which details are shared about you when your friends use apps. Make sure to uncheck all the boxes if you don’t want any of your information, like your birthday or hometown, accessed by your friends’ apps.• Audit your Facebook privacy settings. If you are concerned about what details apps can see about you and your Facebook friends, now is a good time to check your privacy settings and minimize the information you share publicly. For example, you can make sure that only your friends can see your Facebook posts, or that only you can see your friends list.• Read privacy policies. When you sign up for a new app or web tool, the company typically asks you to agree to its terms of service. Make it a habit to peruse the terms and pay particular attention to the privacy policy. If you see language that suggests your data could be shared in a way that makes you uncomfortable, don’t use the program.• Install a tracker blocker. There are add-ons that you can install in your browser that try to block trackers embedded on websites. But be aware that in some cases, they will make parts of websites work improperly. In our tests, Disconnect and Privacy Badger were useful tools for blocking trackers on Google’s Chrome browser.

Here’s a primer on how tracking works, to give you a sense of why blockers are important: When you engage with an app on Facebook, it may plant a tracker in your web browser, like a cookie, that collects information from you. Even when you close out of the app, the tracker can continue to follow your activities, like the other sites you visit or the people you interact with through status updates, according to Michael Priem, chief executive of Modern Impact, an advertising firm in Minneapolis.“It doesn’t go away after you’ve stopped looking at the ad,” he said.• Install an ad blocker. Another way to block trackers is to prevent ads from loading altogether. Ad blockers are also add-ons that you can install for your browser on your mobile device or computer. Mobile ads are fully functioning programs, and they sometimes include malware that harvest some of your data. Even the largest websites do not have tight control over the ads that appear on their sites — and sometimes malicious code can appear inside their ad networks. A popular ad blocker among security researchers is uBlock Origin.• Clear your browsing data. Periodically, you can clear your cookies and browsing history. Apple, Google and Microsoft have published instructions on how to clear data for their browsers Safari, Chrome and Internet Explorer. That will temporarily delete cookies and trackers, though they will probably reappear over time.• Be wary of unknown brands. Even if you read the privacy policies, you still may have to take them with a grain of salt. In the case of the thisisyourdigitallife app, the fine print said the information would be collected for academic use, not commercial purposes. So think twice before sharing information with unfamiliar companies or organizations. (Then again, the researcher came from Cambridge University, one of the world’s top schools — so who can you really trust?)

Sign up here.Mark Zuckerberg has broken his silence on the Cambridge Analytica crisis.Facebook’s chief executive posted a statement on his Facebook page, saying he was taking action to prevent people’s data on the social network from being misused.

“We have a responsibility to protect your data, and if we can’t then we don’t deserve to serve you,” Mr. Zuckerberg wrote. “I’ve been working to understand exactly what happened and how to make sure this doesn’t happen again.”        Continue reading the main story

        Here are the steps the company is taking to address the issue:• “We will investigate all apps that had access to large amounts of information before we changed our platform to dramatically reduce data access in 2014, and we will conduct a full audit of any app with suspicious activity.”• “We will restrict developers’ data access even further to prevent other kinds of abuse.”• “We want to make sure you understand which apps you’ve allowed to access your data. In the next month, we will show everyone a tool at the top of your News Feed with the apps you’ve used and an easy way to revoke those apps’ permissions to your data.”Mr. Zuckerberg had drawn criticism for his response to how Cambridge Analytica improperly obtained data on 50 million Facebook users. In the days since the news first broke this weekend, he had not commented publicly on the crisis.That contrasts with how other tech chief executives have addressed crises at their firms.Kevin Roose and Sheera Frenkel of the NYT report:When a former engineer revealed a pattern of sexual harassment at Uber last year, Travis Kalanick, then the company’s chief executive, said he would immediately open an investigation.
When users complained about bugs and problems with the Apple Maps app in 2012, Tim Cook, the company’s chief executive, released a statement that said “we fell short.”
And in 2011, when Netflix tried to split off its mail-order DVD business into a company called Qwikster, its chief executive, Reed Hastings, wrote a letter to the public. “I messed up,” he said. “I owe everyone an explanation.”So why did it take so long for Mr. Zuckerberg to respond? Kate Losse, an early Facebook employee and Mr. Zuckerberg’s former speechwriter, told the NYT: “My guess is that what is giving Zuckerberg pause at this point is the question of how to acknowledge and explain this state of affairs while at the same time mitigating the concerns that will come from people finally understanding how this all worked.”Peter Eavis’s take: There was something missing from Mark Zuckerberg’s response – a full explanation of why Facebook took so long to disclose the misuse of its data. As Mr. Zuckerberg noted, Facebook found out in 2015 that Aleksandr Kogan had violated company policies by sharing user data with Cambridge Analytica. Facebook users might ask why the abuse wasn’t disclosed at the time. Often it has taken pressure from outsiders to get Facebook to reveal abuses of its network. An alternative approach would have been for Facebook to proactively disclose as much information as possible about the wrongdoing. Facebook users would most likely welcome a strong commitment from Mr. Zuckerberg to do just that.Photo

            Takeaways from Powell’s first Fed meeting.The Federal Reserve, as widely expected, raised interest rates on Wednesday by a quarter of a percentage point. The bigger questions were about the strength of the economy and pace of future rate increases.On those matters, the Federal Reserve has expressed more confidence in the strength of the economy.Dot plot: Fed officials signaled they would raise rates at a quicker pace over the next three years. Policymakers now expect to hike rates three times this year, three times in 2019 and twice in 2020. At its December meeting, policymakers expected three rate hikes this year, but just two in 2019.

Economic projections: Officials raised their median estimates for economic growth this year to 2.7 percent, up from 2.5 percent in December. Fed policymakers also expect inflation to run above 2 percent by 2019 and 2020.Mr. Powell’s news conference: The new Fed chairman expressed optimism about the current economic picture and said officials were trying to strike a balance between raising rates too slowly or too quickly. “We’re trying to take that middle ground.”Mr. Powell left the door open to more or fewer than three increases this year, depending on economic conditions. “Like any set of forecasts, those forecasts will change over time,” he said. “It could change up. It could change down”On inflation, he added: “There is no sense in the data that we’re on the cusp of an acceleration of inflation. We have seen moderate increases in wages and price inflation. And we seem to be seeing more of that.”Photo

            Why driverless cars are essential to Uber’s future.The answer has to do with car ownership. For years, Uber and its rivals have promoted the idea that people living in urban areas will turn to Uber to get to and from work and to run errands rather than buy a car.If Uber can become an alternative to car ownership, that would greatly increase its potential market.A study last year from the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute, Texas A&M Transportation Institute, and Columbia University suggested that people might make the switch.But for people give up their cars, the cost of using Uber would most likely have to fall far below current levels. The need for this drop in costs came up when Dara Khosrowshahi, the C.E.O. of Uber, recently sat down for an interview with David Solomon, president and C.O.O. of Goldman Sachs.

Here’s the write-up of the autonomous car portion of their conversation in a recent Goldman note to clients:“Uber stressed the importance not only of autonomous technology for the future of the company, but also the value it can create from developing that technology within its existing network. In order for Uber to truly become a legitimate alternative to car ownership it must take its per mile cost below the cost of car ownership, or $0.80-$0.90/mile, from the $2.50/mile it costs on average today for an UberX, according to management. While initiatives like pooling (50% of rides in some cities) and driver density can help to lower costs, autonomous is the single most transformative piece of the equation. Uber expects to partner aggressively on this front, noting that ‘winning’ is making sure every single autonomous player is plugged into its network.”Calculating the fallout from the Uber self-driving car death.The pedestrian fatality in Arizona is perhaps Dara Khosrowshahi’s first major test as Uber’s C.E.O., leaving him with a difficult choice: keep spending on a technology that Uber considers essential to its future, or dial back to reduce risks ahead of an I.P.O.?Investigators are also looking into whether the victim’s actions — suddenly stepping onto a darkened street — could limit Uber’s liability.Toyota has paused its self-driving tests; Ford and G.M. have yet to do so. Separately, Uber has hired Tammy Albarran from Covington and Burling as its deputy general counsel, replacing Angela Padilla.Elsewhere in tech: The Russian cybersecurity company Kaspersky Labs has reportedly exposed a U.S. cyberespionage operation focused on ISIS. Expect a merger frenzy in lithium. Expedia’s Orbitz disclosed a breach that affects about 880,000 payment cards. And Amazon has surpassed Alphabet as the second-biggest publicly traded company by market value.Tesla’s shareholders approve Musk’s pay package.The electric car maker’s investors backed the board’s proposal to grant Elon Musk, its C.E.O., stock options valued at $2.6 billion, Bloomberg reports.The stock options won’t vest unless a set of ambitious financial goals are met. “Mr. Musk will earn one-12th of the options every time Tesla hits a pair of goals: one tied to its market value and the other linked to either revenue or earnings excluding certain charges. For Musk to get all the options, Tesla would have to become worth $650 billion — more than Facebook Inc. — and produce more revenue than Procter & Gamble Co.,” Bloomberg reports.Photo

            Pete Peterson is dead at 91The billionaire — whose career highlights include being C.E.O. of a major industrial company at 36, serving in the Nixon administration, running Lehman Brothers, cofounding the Blackstone Group and doggedly arguing for reducing the U.S. deficit — died yesterday.Mr. Peterson was always self-deprecating, once describing himself to the NYT as a “kind of a closet, second-rate intellectual.” And this is from a 2007 Lunch with the FT:“Let’s be honest,” he says, “dumb luck can play a huge role in life. It is all too easy in the 1990s for people to say I must be a genius investor because I got returns of 30 percent or whatever. If you combine a lot of leverage with a booming stock market it isn’t all that difficult to make a lot of money, so I don’t think we should get carried away with ourselves, frankly.”What to expect from the forthcoming spending billCourtesy of our colleague Tom Kaplan:

The deal is still awaiting approval from American regulators, with the German chemicals giant saying on Wednesdaythat it was “working closely” with the Justice Department and other United States authorities. Bayer hopes to close the transaction by the end of the second quarter.To win approval of European regulators, the companies said they would sell a variety of businesses, including agreeing to sell parts of Bayer’s crop science business to BASF for about $7 billion in October.Bayer has committed to sell its entire vegetable seeds business as part of its concessions, European regulators said in a news release on Thursday. Bayer previously said it was in exclusive talks with BASF about the sale of that business.— Chad BrayPhoto

The Federal Trade Commission is investigating whether it has violated a privacy agreement. Britain’s data protection watchdog has warned Facebook away from its Cambridge Analytica investigation. And a founder of WhatsApp urged his Twitter followers to delete their accounts.Given all that, Paul Ford asks in Bloomberg Businessweek whether the U.S. needs a digital protection agency, comparing its potential scope to that of the Environmental Protection Agency.Mark Zuckerberg, silent so far, is expected to speak about Facebook’s latest scandal within the next 24 hours, according to Axios.Critics’ corner• Sandy Parakilas, a former Facebook employee involved in its apps platform, writes: “Facebook has systematically failed to enforce its own policies. The only solution is external oversight.” (WaPo)• Shira Ovide says the damage may be permanent. (Gadfly)• Nick Thompson and Fred Vogelstein say Facebook may have taken the wrong lesson from past scandals: “All of those crises have passed with limited damage. And perhaps that’s why the company appears to have underestimated the power of the storm clouds moving in.” (Wired)

            The race to avoid U.S. tariffsAt the Group of 20’s meeting in Buenos Aires, finance ministers from France, Argentina, South Korea and elsewhere peppered Steven Mnuchin with requests for exemptions from President Trump’s forthcoming tariffs on imported metal. The U.S. Treasury secretary said, “This is all about free and fair and reciprocal trade.”The problem: The White House hasn’t said exactly what would qualify a country for an exemption (it has made vague references to protecting national security and reducing bilateral trade deficits).Meanwhile, the White House is ready to announce more tariffs and limits on Chinese investments as soon as tomorrow — risking a trade war that it can’t win on its own, Michael Schuman argues on Bloomberg View.Elsewhere in trade: The White House’s efforts to renegotiate Nafta now include a bid to limit warning labels on junk food, according to the NYT.The political flyaround• Congress continues to discuss its $1.3 trillion spending bill.

For much of the past week, Facebook has been embroiled in a controversy involving Cambridge Analytica, a political consulting firm with ties to Donald J. Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign, and how the firm improperly obtained and exploited personal data from 50 million Facebook users.On Wednesday, following widespread questions about his whereabouts, Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Facebook, spoke with two New York Times reporters, Sheera Frenkel and Kevin Roose, about the controversy and the steps he was taking to make the social network less prone to abuse.Video

                Recent reports of a Facebook data breach by Cambridge Analytica has caused some to reconsider staying with the social media platform. Following a conversation with Mark Zuckerberg, NYT tech reporter, Kevin Roose, chatted with Facebook live viewers about whether or not they plan to sign-off for good.

    Below is a transcript of the conversation, edited for length and clarity.Sheera Frenkel: Did it come as a surprise to you, the user response to the news that Cambridge Analytica had accessed this trove of data?Mark Zuckerberg: Privacy issues have always been incredibly important to people. One of our biggest responsibilities is to protect data. If you think about what our services are, at their most basic level, you put some content into a service, whether it’s a photo or a video or a text message — whether it’s Facebook or WhatsApp or Instagram — and you’re trusting that that content is going to be shared with the people you want to share it with. Whenever there’s an issue where someone’s data gets passed to someone who the rules of the system shouldn’t have allowed it to, that’s rightfully a big issue and deserves to be a big uproar.

Frenkel: It took quite a few days for your response to come out. Is that because you were weighing these three action points that you noted in your post?        Continue reading the main story

        Zuckerberg: The first thing is, I really wanted to make sure we had a full and accurate understanding of everything that happened. I know that there was a lot of pressure to speak sooner, but my assessment was that it was more important that what we said was fully accurate.The second thing is, the most important thing is that we fix this system so that issues like this don’t happen again. It’s not like there aren’t going to be other different kind of things we’ll also have to fix. But when there’s a certain problem, we have a responsibility to at least make sure we resolve that problem.So the actions here that we’re going to do involve first, dramatically reducing the amount of data that developers have access to, so that apps and developers can’t do what Kogan did here. The most important actions there we actually took three or four years ago, in 2014. But when we examined the systems this week, there were certainly other things we felt we should lock down, too. So we’re going ahead and doing that.Even if you solve the problem going forward, there’s still this issue of: Are there other Cambridge Analyticas out there, or other Kogans who, when the platform worked a certain way in the past, were there apps which could have gotten access to more information, and potentially sold it without us knowing, or done something that violated people’s trust? We also need to make sure we get that under control. That’s why we spent a lot of time figuring out, O.K. here’s what it’s going to take to do a full investigation of every app that got access to a large amount of information before we changed the platform policies to dramatically reduce the data access that developers had. For any app that we uncover that has any suspicious activity, we’re going to go do a full forensic audit, and make sure we have the capacity to do that, to make sure that other developers aren’t doing what Kogan did here.The third thing is, it’s really important that people know what apps they’ve authorized. A lot of people have been on Facebook now for five or 10 years, and sometimes you signed into an app a long time ago and you may have forgotten about that. So one of the steps we’re taking is making it so apps can no longer access data after you haven’t used them for three months.But it’s also just really important to put in front of people a tool of, here are all the apps you’ve connected to and authorized, here’s an easy way to deauthorize them, to revoke their permission to get access to your activity.Kevin Roose: Is Facebook planning to notify the 50 million users whose data was shared with Cambridge Analytica?

Zuckerberg: Yes. We’re going to tell anyone whose data may have been shared.Now, there’s a question of whether we have the exact record in our systems today of who your friends were on that day when there was access three and a half or four years ago, so we’re going to be conservative on that and try to tell anyone whose data may have been affected, even if we don’t know for certain that they were. It’s likely that we’ll build a tool like we did with the Russian misinformation investigation, that anyone can go to it and see if their data was affected by this.Roose: Do you have a preliminary estimate of how many apps you’ll be investigating?Zuckerberg: It will be in the thousands.Frenkel: Were those app developers notified that you’ll be investigating this yet?Zuckerberg: Just when I posted. And we’ll be reaching out in the near term.Frenkel: Are you going to be hiring people to help conduct those investigations?Zuckerberg: Yes, I would imagine we’re going to have to grow the team to work on this.Roose: You mentioned a contract that developers will have to sign in order to ask anyone for access to broader profile information. What will be the terms of that contract, and what will be the penalties for violating it?Zuckerberg: So, the important thing there is that it’s a high-touch process. The specific point we were trying to make is that it’s not going to be some terms of service that a developer can sign up for just on their computer when developing something. I guess technically, that would be a contract as well.The point of what we’re trying to do here is to create a situation where we have a real person-to-person relationship with any developer who is asking for the most sensitive data. That doesn’t mean that — if you’re a developer and you want to put Facebook Login on your website, you can do that. If you want to get access to ask people for their religious affiliation, or their sexual orientation, for data that could be very sensitive, we want to make sure we have a clear relationship with those people.Frenkel: We understood that Cambridge Analytica had reached out to Facebook and asked that its ban on the platform be reconsidered. Are you giving any thought to allowing Cambridge Analytica back in?

Zuckerberg: The first thing we need to do is conduct this full forensic audit of the firm, that they don’t have any people’s data from our community and that they’ve deleted anything, including derivative data, that they might have. We’re working with the regulator in the U.K. on this, so our forensic audit was actually paused in the near term to cede the way for the ICO there to do their own government investigation. We’re certainly not going to consider letting them back onto the platform until we have full confirmation that there’s no wrongdoing here.Roose: There were reports as far back as 2015 that Cambridge Analytica had access to this data set. Why didn’t you suspend them then?Zuckerberg: So, we actually heard, I think it was at the end of 2015 — some journalists from The Guardian reached out to us and told us what you just said. And it was not just about Cambridge Analytica, it was about this developer, Aleksandr Kogan, who had shared data with them.

We took action immediately at that point. We banned Kogan’s app from the platform, we demanded that Kogan and Cambridge Analytica and a couple other parties that Kogan had shared the data with would legally certify that they didn’t have the data, and weren’t using it in any of their operations. They gave us that formal certification. At the time, they told us they never had gotten access to raw Facebook data, so we made that decision.Frenkel: In retrospect, do you wish you had demanded proof that the data had been deleted?Zuckerberg: Yes. They gave us a formal and legal certification, and it seems at this point that that was false.Again, we haven’t done our full investigation and audit yet so I can’t say definitively that they actually have data. I’ve just read all the same reports that you have, including in The New York Times, that says that journalists have seen evidence that they have the data, which is a strong enough signal for us to go on, and take action here.That’s the basic driver behind us now needing to go and do a full investigation into any app that had access to a large amount of data before we locked down the platform policies in 2014. Just having folks tell us that they were using the data correctly, I think, does not satisfy our responsibility to our community to protect their data.Frenkel: Are you actively looking at some of these dark web data brokers that have been in news reports recently, that say that other independent researchers are potentially trading in this data?

Zuckerberg: Yes, we’re investigating that too.Roose: Are you worried about the #DeleteFacebook campaign that’s been going around? Have you seen meaningful numbers of people deleting their accounts, and are you worried that will be a trend?Zuckerberg: I don’t think we’ve seen a meaningful number of people act on that, but, you know, it’s not good. I think it’s a clear signal that this is a major trust issue for people, and I understand that. And whether people delete their app over it or just don’t feel good about using Facebook, that’s a big issue that I think we have a responsibility to rectify.Frenkel: We’re now heading into the 2018 midterms. Could you speak about what Facebook is going to do ahead of the 2018 midterms to make people feel more confident that the platform won’t be used this way again?Zuckerberg: This is an incredibly important point. There’s no doubt that in 2016, there were a number of issues including foreign interference and false news that we did not have as much of a handle on as we feel a responsibility to for our community.Now, the good news here is that these problems aren’t necessarily rocket science. They’re hard, but they’re things that if you invest and work on making it harder for adversaries to do what they’re trying to do, you can really reduce the amount of false news, make it harder for foreign governments to interfere.One of the things that gives me confidence is that we’ve seen a number of elections at this point where this has gone a lot better. In the months after the 2016 election, there was the French election. The new A.I. tools we built after the 2016 elections found, I think, more than 30,000 fake accounts that we believe were linked to Russian sources who were trying to do the same kind of tactics they did in the U.S. in the 2016 election. We were able to disable them and prevent that from happening on a large scale in France.In last year, in 2017 with the special election in Alabama, we deployed some new A.I. tools to identify fake accounts and false news, and we found a significant number of Macedonian accounts that were trying to spread false news, and were able to eliminate those. And that, actually, is something I haven’t talked about publicly before, so you’re the first people I’m telling about that.I feel a lot better about the systems now. At the same time, I think Russia and other governments are going to get more sophisticated in what they do, too. So we need to make sure that we up our game. This is a massive focus for us to make sure we’re dialed in for not only the 2018 elections in the U.S., but the Indian elections, the Brazilian elections, and a number of other elections that are going on this year that are really important.

Frenkel: The Times reported that [Facebook chief security officer Alex] Stamos will be leaving toward the end of this year. Is there a broader plan for how Facebook is going to structure security on its platform ahead of all these important elections?Zuckerberg: Sure. One of the important things we’ve done is, we want to unify all of our security efforts. And you reported on a reorg around Alex Stamos, and I’ll say something about him in a second. He’s been a very valuable contributor here and was a really central figure in helping us identify the foreign interference with Russia. And I think he has done very good work, and I’m hopeful he’ll be engaged for a while here on that.One of the big things we needed to do is coordinate our efforts a lot better across the whole company. It’s not all A.I., right? There’s certainly a lot that A.I. can do, we can train classifiers to identify content, but most of what we do is identify things that people should look at. So we’re going to double the amount of people working on security this year. We’ll have more than 20,000 people working on security and community operations by the end of the year, I think we have about 15,000 now. So it’s really the technical systems we have working with the people in our operations functions that make the biggest deal.The last thing I’d add on this. Take things like false news. You know, a lot of it is really spam, if you think about it. It’s the same people who might have been sending you Viagra emails in the ’90s, now they’re trying to come up with sensational content and push it into Facebook and other apps in order to get you to click on it and see ads. There are some pretty basic policy decisions we’ve made, like O.K., if you’re anywhere close to being a fake news site, you can’t put Facebook ads on your site, right? So then suddenly, it becomes harder for them to make money. If you make it hard enough for them to make money, they just kind of go and do something else.Roose: Is the basic economic model of Facebook, in which users provide data that Facebook uses to help advertisers and developers to better target potential customers and users — do you feel like that works, given what we now know about the risks?Zuckerberg: Yeah, so this is a really important question. The thing about the ad model that is really important that aligns with our mission is that — our mission is to build a community for everyone in the world and to bring the world closer together. And a really important part of that is making a service that people can afford. A lot of the people, once you get past the first billion people, can’t afford to pay a lot. Therefore, having it be free and have a business model that is ad-supported ends up being really important and aligned.Now, over time, might there be ways for people who can afford it to pay a different way? That’s certainly something we’ve thought about over time. But I don’t think the ad model is going to go away, because I think fundamentally, it’s important to have a service like this that everyone in the world can use, and the only way to do that is to have it be very cheap or free.Roose: Adam Mosseri, Facebook’s head of News Feed, recently said he had lost some sleep over Facebook’s role in the violence in Myanmar. You’ve said you’re “outraged” about what happened with Cambridge Analytica, but when you think about the many things that are happening with Facebook all over the world, are you losing any sleep? Do you feel any guilt about the role Facebook is playing in the world?

Zuckerberg: That’s a good question. I think, you know, we’re doing something here which is unprecedented, in terms of building a community for people all over the world to be able to share what matters to them, and connect across boundaries. I think what we’re seeing is, there are new challenges that I don’t think anyone had anticipated before.If you had asked me, when I got started with Facebook, if one of the central things I’d need to work on now is preventing governments from interfering in each other’s elections, there’s no way I thought that’s what I’d be doing, if we talked in 2004 in my dorm room.

I don’t know that it’s possible to know every issue that you’re going to face down the road. But we have a real responsibility to take all these issues seriously as they come up, and work with experts and people around the world to make sure we solve them, and do a good job for our community.It’s certainly true that, over the course of Facebook, I’ve made all kinds of different mistakes, whether that’s technical mistakes or business mistakes or hiring mistakes. We’ve launched product after product that didn’t work. I spend most of my time looking forward, trying to figure out how to solve the issues that people are having today, because I think that’s what people in our community would want.

WASHINGTON — The political action committee founded by John R. Bolton, President Trump’s incoming national security adviser, was one of the earliest customers of Cambridge Analytica, which it hired specifically to develop psychological profiles of voters with data harvested from tens of millions of Facebook profiles, according to former Cambridge employees and company documents.Mr. Bolton’s political committee, known as The John Bolton Super PAC, first hired Cambridge in August 2014, months after the political data firm was founded and while it was still harvesting the Facebook data.In the two years that followed, Mr. Bolton’s super PAC spent nearly $1.2 million primarily for “survey research,” which is a term that campaigns use for polling, according to campaign finance records.But the contract between the political action committee and Cambridge, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times, offers more detail on just what Mr. Bolton was buying. The contract broadly describes the services to be delivered by Cambridge as “behavioral microtargeting with psychographic messaging.”

To do that work, Cambridge used Facebook data, according to the documents and two former employees familiar with the work.        Continue reading the main story

        “The data and modeling Bolton’s PAC received was derived from the Facebook data,” said Christopher Wylie, a data expert who was part of the team that founded Cambridge Analytica. “We definitely told them about how we were doing it. We talked about it in conference calls, in meetings.”Cambridge Analytica, which rose to prominence through its work with Mr. Trump’s 2016 election campaign, has found itself confronting a deepening crisis since reports this past weekend in The New York Times and The Observer of London that the firm had harvested the data from more than 50 million Facebook profiles in its bid to develop techniques for predicting the behavior of individual American voters.Cambridge’s so-called psychographic modeling techniques, which were built in part with the data harvested from Facebook, underpinned its work for Mr. Trump’s campaign in 2016, setting off a furious — and still unsettled — debate about whether the firm’s technology worked. The same techniques were also the focus of its work for Mr. Bolton’s super PAC.“The Bolton PAC was obsessed with how America was becoming limp wristed and spineless and it wanted research and messaging for national security issues,” Mr. Wylie said.“That really meant making people more militaristic in their worldview,” he added. “That’s what they said they wanted, anyway.”Using the psychographic models, Cambridge helped design concepts for advertisements for candidates supported by Mr. Bolton’s PAC, including the 2014 campaign of Thom Tillis, the Republican senator from North Carolina, according to Mr. Wylie and another former employee, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid being dragged into the investigations that now appear to be engulfing Cambridge.One advertisement, a video that was posted on YouTube, was aimed at people who scored high for conscientiousness, and were thought to respect hard work and experience. It emphasized Mr. Bolton’s time working for Ronald Reagan and how Mr. Tillis embodied the spirit and political ethos of the late president.

Cambridge Analytica, which grew out of the London-based SCL Group, was founded in 2014 with a $15 million investment from Mr. Mercer, whose daughter Rebekah sits on the firm’s board of directors. Stephen K. Bannon was also a co-founder.At the same time, Mr. Mercer was financially supporting Mr. Bolton’s PAC, donating $5 million between April 2014 and September 2016, according to Federal Election Commission filings. The Mercers also backed Mr. Trump in the presidential election.The Mercer family has not publicly commented since the reports about the misuse of Facebook data by Cambridge first surfaced in The Times and The Observer.The reports have prompted calls from lawmakers in Britain and the United States for renewed scrutiny of Facebook, and at least two American state prosecutors have said they are looking into the misuse of data by Cambridge Analytica.The company also suspended its chief executive, Alexander Nix, after a television broadcast this week in which he was recorded suggesting that the company had used seduction and bribery to entrap politicians and influence foreign elections.But it is the harvesting of Facebook data that has cast the harshest spotlight on Cambridge, and Mr. Bolton’s experience with the company appears to have provided a model for how it sold itself to future political campaigns, including Mr. Trump’s.

The firm took the psychographic profiles it was building off the Facebook data at the time and combined them with voter databases and other sets of data. Staff from SCL’s elections division, which through a convoluted corporate structure was interchangeable with Cambridge, discussed what they were doing at a meeting in July 2014 with another contractor for the Bolton PAC, according to an agenda of the meeting obtained by The Times.The profiles would be used to “identify the personality traits of individuals” in states to be targeted by the Bolton PAC, said the agenda, which was prepared for SCL and Cambridge staff. “Individuals can be targeted with the right message,” it said.The agenda also included a line, in boldfaced text, that said SCL wanted to use voter contact lists available to Bolton’s campaign to direct people “toward the FB app.” Cambridge, working through an outside researcher, used a Facebook app to harvest data from the social network’s profiles. The app claimed to be collecting data for academic research, and users were not aware of its true purpose.Months later, the relationship between Cambridge and the Bolton PAC had grown so close that the firm was writing up talking points for Mr. Bolton. In an email dated Oct. 1, 2014, Cambridge staff outlined a few sentences that Mr. Bolton could use to describe the work the new firm was doing for his super PAC.“It’s not just about how much you spend. It’s also about how smart you spend,” the email advised Mr. Bolton to say.

“One way we’re doing that is by enlisting an outside firm” — Cambridge Analytica — “to provide deepdive research into who makes up our audience of target voters,” it continued. “We are producing ads specifically designed for voters of a certain personality and demographic profile. So if you’re a young woman in New Hampshire with a specific kind of personality and a particular set of issues that you care about, our research allows us to connect with that voter in a way that truly resonates with her.”The subject line of the email: “Did Bannon come back to you on this?”

    Cambridge Analytica Whistleblower Testifies in U.K.

        
            
                Christopher Wylie told British lawmakers that President Trump’s election made him realize the wider impact of the techniques used by the data analytics firm he helped found.

    LONDON — The whistle-blower Christopher Wylie held a roomful of British lawmakers rapt for three and a half hours on Tuesday, like a pink-haired, nose-ringed oracle sent from the future to explain data.In testimony to the House of Commons’ select committee on culture, Mr. Wylie, a 28-year-old Canadian, described the inner workings of SCL, a political consultancy that gave its clients access to a vast collection of personal information harvested from Facebook.In one of the longest sessions in recent memory, Mr. Wylie made a number of jaw-dropping assertions, most significantly that the company’s exploitation of personal data had swung the results of Britain’s 2016 referendum on leaving the European Union. He also suggested that his predecessor at Cambridge Analytica was murdered.But mostly, Mr. Wylie tried to explain data-mining. He looked like a cerebral skate-rat, which might in other circumstances have undermined his credibility, but in this case it seemed to help. He was polite. He resembled, as one journalist put it, “a patient grandson trying to set up a Skype call with his gran.”

His message was clear: If you aren’t already worried about how your personal data is being used, now would be a good time to start. “The way I like to think of it, data is the electricity of our new economy, and electricity can be quite dangerous,” he said. “We enjoy the benefits of electricity, despite the fact that it can literally kill you.”        Continue reading the main story

        Cambridge Analytica released a statement describing Mr. Wylie as “a part-time contractor who left in July 2014 and has no direct knowledge of our work or practices since then.” It said Cambridge Analytica, a subsidiary of the SCL political consultancy, did not use its cache of data in Donald J. Trump’s 2016 campaign, and had no involvement in the European Union referendum that ended with a victory for those who support withdrawal, or Brexit, from the bloc.Mr. Wylie’s testimony bluntly contradicted that of his former boss, Alexander Nix, who has recently appeared before the same committee twice. Mr. Wylie said a cluster of pro-Brexit organizations employed a Canadian subsidiary company, Aggregate IQ, which provided them with SCL’s store of data.“I think it is completely reasonable to say that there could have been a different outcome of the referendum had there not been, in my view, cheating,” he said.He also suggested that Russian intelligence agencies could have easily scooped up the company’s vast library of data on American voters in advance of the 2016 elections in the United States, because Aleksandr Kogan, the scientist who collected it, made regular return trips to Russia.“Put a key logger in Kogan’s computer in Russia and you’ve got everything,” Mr. Wylie said. He added: “It would make it incredibly easy for them to get access to this data. For me, that’s concerning and I think it should be looked into.”Mr. Wylie’s appearance has coincided with a surge of collective dismay over data-mining, and many found themselves riveted by his testimony on Tuesday. Georgia Rakusen, 33, a user researcher at a technology firm in London, urged her Twitter followers to tune into the hearing, which she called “absolutely gripping stuff.”His testimony, she said, “was something that, as a lay person, you could watch and start to grasp the enormity of how your data is used.”

“I think maybe people are just beginning to open up, to realize that maybe it’s not just about ads, maybe it’s not just what bands I like,” she said. Ms. Rakusen, who described her own work as “a space where we are supposed to make people click more,” said she hoped that employees of large technology companies would come forward more, looking at whistle-blowers like Mr. Wylie and Edward J. Snowden.

“I didn’t watch the whole three and a half hours,” she said. “But I basically didn’t get any other work done during that time.”Mr. Wylie, who has described himself a “gay Canadian vegan,” dropped out of high school but discovered a genius for coding and, still in his teens, began working for political campaigns. He came close to losing his composure at only one moment on Tuesday, when he was asked what prompted him to turn against the technology he had helped create. He said his views had changed when Mr. Trump was elected.“It was no longer this niche, shady firm,” he said. “It was a firm that was making a massive impact on the world. It’s a process of coming to terms with what you have created, and the impact that has had.”“I am incredibly remorseful for my role in setting it up,” he added, his voice wavering. “I’m the first person to say that I should have known better. But what’s done is done.”He was caustic on the subject of his former boss, Mr. Nix, who he said enjoyed the colonial challenge of manipulating the affairs of less developed countries. He recalled that once, they were late to a meeting because Mr. Nix had to collect a chandelier he had bought for $283,000.“You have to remember that a lot of these people are very wealthy already,” he said. “The thing that I learned is for certain wealthy people, they need something to keep them occupied. They need projects. And for certain wealthy people, going into the developing world and running a country is something that appeals to them.”At times, he seemed slightly pitying of British officials who are investigating data-mining, saying they did not have enough resources and lacked a “robust technical background.”“I have had to explain and re-explain and re-explain and re-explain, you know, how relational databases work, what is an eigenvector, what is dimensionality reduction,” he said.“They have been working really, really hard. But as a point of observation, one of the weak points that I’ve seen — again, this is an empathetic criticism — is the lack of technical people,” he said, apparently searching for a polite way to say it. “They have had to ask me a lot of questions that a database engineer would not ask.”

        NEW YORK —  Facebook's CEO apologized for the Cambridge Analytica scandal with ads in multiple U.S. and British newspapers Sunday, saying the social media platform doesn't deserve to hold personal information if it can't protect it.The ads signed by Mark Zuckerberg said a quiz app built by a Cambridge University researcher leaked Facebook data of millions of people four years ago. ""This was a breach of trust, and I'm sorry we didn't do more at the time. We're now taking steps to make sure this doesn't happen again,"" the ads said.Facebook's privacy practices have come under fire after Cambridge Analytica, a political consulting firm affiliated with President Donald Trump's 2016 election campaign, got data inappropriately. The firm is alleged to have created psychological profiles to influence how people vote or even think about politics and society.Facebook's stock value has dropped more than $70 billion since the revelations were first published.Among the newspapers with the ads were The New York Times and The Washington Post in the U.S. and The Sunday Times and The Sunday Telegraph in the United Kingdom.

The ads said Facebook is limiting the data apps receive when users sign in. It's also investigating every app that had access to large amounts of data. ""We expect there are others. And when we find them, we will ban them and tell everyone affected,"" the ads stated.Zuckerberg closed the ads by saying: ""I promise to do better for you.""Cambridge Analytica got the data from a researcher who paid 270,000 Facebook users to complete a psychological profile quiz back in 2014. But the quiz gathered information on their friends as well, bringing the total number of people affected to about 50 million.        Continue reading the main story

        LONDON —  Britain's information regulator said Saturday it was assessing evidence gathered from a raid on the office of data mining firm Cambridge Analytica, part of an investigation into alleged misuse of personal information by political campaigns and social media companies like Facebook.More than a dozen investigators from the Information Commissioner's Office entered the company's central London office late Friday, shortly after a High Court judge granted a warrant. The investigators were seen leaving the premises early Saturday after spending about seven hours searching the office.The regulator said it will ""consider the evidence before deciding the next steps and coming to any conclusions.""""This is one part of a larger investigation by the ICO into the use of personal data and analytics by political campaigns, parties, social media companies and other commercial actors,"" it said.

The footage also showed Nix saying Cambridge Analytica played a major role in securing Donald Trump's victory in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

        WASHINGTON —  Special counsel Robert Mueller is scrutinizing the connections between President Donald Trump's campaign and the data mining firm Cambridge Analytica, which has come under fierce criticism over reports that it swiped the data of more than 50 million Facebook users to sway elections.Mueller's investigators have asked former campaign officials about the Trump campaign's data operations, particularly about how it collected and utilized voter data in battleground states, according to a person with direct knowledge of the line of inquiry but not authorized to discuss it publicly.The investigators have also asked some of Trump's data team, which included analysts at the Republican National Committee, about its relationship with Cambridge Analytica, according to two former campaign officials. The campaign paid the firm just under $6 million for its work in 2016, according to federal records.Authorities in Britain and the United States are investigating whether Cambridge Analytica may have used data improperly obtained from Facebook to try to influence elections, including the 2016 White House race.

        The Trump campaign has distanced itself from the data mining firm, which had been financed by major Republican donors and, for a time, employed Steve Bannon, the conservative provocateur who later became Trump's campaign chief executive.Trump turned to Twitter on Thursday to boast about his campaign's social media efforts compared with those of his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, but it was not clear what prompted the declaration.""Remember when they were saying, during the campaign, that Donald Trump is giving great speeches and drawing big crowds, but he is spending much less money and not using social media as well as Crooked Hillary's large and highly sophisticated staff. Well, not saying that anymore!"" Trump wrote.A request for an explanation from the White House was not returned.The exact role that Cambridge Analytica played for the Trump campaign has remained murky.Staffers at Cambridge Analytica made several overtures to the Trump campaign before eventually being retained. They first requested a meeting in spring 2015, before the celebrity businessman officially announced his candidacy, according to four former campaign officials who were not authorized to publicly discuss internal operations and spoke on condition of anonymity.Alexander Nix, the Cambridge Analytica CEO captured on a sting video released this week, met with then-campaign manager Corey Lewandowski to make a pitch for the data-mining company's voter target products, including its so-called psychographic method.Lewandowski passed, in part because the staff believed Trump would not be willing to make a sizable financial investment in an analytics firm, according to two of the campaign officials.

Cambridge then went to work for the campaign of Trump's Republican rivals Ben Carson and Ted Cruz. But after Trump became the GOP's presumptive nominee, the data firm reached out again, this time to Paul Manafort, who had replaced Lewandowski to become campaign chairman.Manafort was also skeptical about the effectiveness of the firm's methods, but Cambridge was hired, in part as a friendly gesture to the Mercer family, heavyweight Republican donors who helped fund the company's launch a few years earlier, according to one of the former campaign officials.With the Trump campaign concerned that the RNC might not fully invest in Trump — he had clashed repeatedly with the organization — Cambridge was retained. Campaign finance records indicate that the Trump campaign's first payment of $100,000 to the firm came in July 2016.

Five of the firm's staff members were assigned to work with the campaign's digital director, Brad Parscale, at his Texas-based firm, where much of the campaign's digital operation was located.Parscale and Jared Kushner, the candidate's son-in-law, emphasized using social media — and particularly Facebook — to better target voters and pressed its importance on Trump.The campaign tapped Cambridge to build out a database of small-dollar GOP donors, a dataset the company had from its prior work for the Cruz and Carson campaigns.But when it became clear the RNC would share its much-improved data operation with the Trump campaign, Cambridge became de-emphasized. Two of the former campaign officials said their tools were not useful, though Parscale, during a Google forum a month after the election, said the firm became involved in daily tracking polls and helped inform the campaign's decisions on where to spend its resources.Another of the campaign officials said Cambridge was kept around mostly to placate the Mercers and their allies on Trump's staff.All told, the Trump campaign paid Cambridge just under $6 million, according to Federal Election Commission records. The largest payment to Cambridge Analytica — $5 million on Sept. 1, 2016 — was made about two weeks after Bannon was appointed the chief executive of the Trump campaign, according to FEC records. At that same time, another Mercer ally, pollster Kellyanne Conway, was named his campaign manager to replace Manafort.

Bannon, with the Mercers' backing, served as vice president of the firm from June 2014 to August 2016, when he joined the Trump campaign. He has since had a falling-out with the Mercers and with Trump over disparaging comments he made about the president's family.He attempted to draw a line between the campaign and Cambridge while appearing at a Financial Times panel in New York on Thursday. Bannon said he had no knowledge of the data mining operation and instead put the blame on Facebook, saying the social network cared more about profits than privacy and ""takes your data for free and creates huge margins.""Chris Wylie, a former Cambridge Analytica employee who became a whistleblower, told The Washington Post that Cambridge had begun testing phrases like ""drain the swamp"" and ""deep state"" well before Trump launched his campaign. The president began incorporating those concepts into his stump speech in the stretch run of the campaign, soon after Bannon came on board.Wylie has said he fears the data was turned over to Russians who aimed to interfere with the U.S. election.Parscale, who has been appointed Trump's 2020 campaign manager, has slammed the firm on Twitter for taking credit for Trump's victory. ""So incredibly false and ridiculous,"" he wrote this week, declaring Cambridge's comments ""an overblown sales pitch.""Lawmakers have demanded answers from both Cambridge Analytica and Facebook, as Sen. Mark Warner, the Virginia Democrat who is vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, declared this week that the blooming scandal was ""more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West.""""Whether it's allowing Russians to purchase political ads, or extensive micro-targeting based on ill-gotten user data, it's clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency,"" Warner tweeted.The news of Mueller's interest in Cambridge Analytica was first reported by ABC News.___Follow Lemire on Twitter at http://twitter.com/@JonLemire        Continue reading the main story

        LONDON —  The chief executive of data mining firm Cambridge Analytica told a reporter posing as a potential client that his company played a big role in getting Donald Trump elected, a British news program revealed Tuesday.""We did all the research, all the data, all the analytics, all the targeting. We ran all the digital campaign, the television campaign and our data informed all the strategy,"" Nix said during a secretly recorded meeting with the undercover Channel 4 News reporter.The broadcaster aired the comments as Cambridge Analytica's board of directors announced Nix's immediate suspension pending an independent investigation.The board cited recent allegations by a former employee that the firm improperly used information from more than 50 million Facebook accounts to help Trump , as well as unguarded comments Nix made during his meeting with the journalist he thought was a client.

        The Channel 4 reporter posed as a wealthy potential client interested in hiring Cambridge Analytica to influence campaigns in Sri Lanka. Nix claimed to have met Trump ""many times,"" but did not provide details.As part of a sales pitch, Nix said the firm sent emails with a ""self-destruct timer"" during the Trump campaign to make its role more difficult to trace.""So you send them and after they've been read, two hours later, they disappear,"" the broadcaster recorded him saying. ""There's no evidence, there's no paper trail, there's nothing.""

He also said U.S. officials would not investigate his foreign clients because ""they have no jurisdiction.""In another segment from its undercover investigation broadcast Monday, Channel 4 News showed Nix suggesting the company could tarnish political rivals by offering them large amounts of money or tempting them into compromising sexual situations. He suggested incriminating videos could be posted on the internet.He responded by saying he was the victim of media harassment and has denied misleading British authorities or inappropriate information.Channel 4 also quoted Mark Turnbull, another senior figure at Cambridge Analytica, as saying the company could create ""proxy organizations"" to feed negative material about opposition candidates onto the internet and social media.Turnball said ""charities or activist groups"" were useful for such a purpose. The unflattering material could be spread through the internet, but without branding or other identifiers that could be traced back Cambridge Analytica.The company said it has complied with all regulations and is cooperating with British information officials.

        BRASILIA —  Brazilian prosecutors on Wednesday said they had opened an investigation into whether London-based political consultancy Cambridge Analytica acted illegally in Brazil, as controversy over the firm's data harvesting practices spreads across the globe.Prosecutors for Brazil's Federal District, which includes Brasilia, the capital, said in a written statement that they will look into whether the firm, through its partnership with Sao Paulo-based consulting group A Ponte Estratégia Planejamento e Pesquisa LTDA, illegally used the data of millions of Brazilians to create psychographic profiles.Calls to CA Ponte, as the partnership is called, were not answered.Prosecutors from a specialized data unit will look into whether there were security breaches that allowed the firm to illegally access personal data.Regulators and lawmakers in the United States and Europe have demanded an explanation of how the consulting firm, which worked on U.S. President Donald Trump's election campaign, gained access to data on 50 million Facebook Inc  users in order to build voter profiles.Reports on Monday said that the firm may have improperly gained access to the data, and Cambridge Analytica has since suspended its chief executive Alexander Nix, while Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has said his company made mistakes in its handling of user data.By many measures, Brazil is Facebook's third largest market.(Reporting by Ricardo Brito; Writing by Gram Slattery; Editing by Leslie Adler and James Dalgleish)        Continue reading the main story

        NAIROBI, Kenya —  Lawyers for Kenya's opposition are poring through a British broadcaster's investigation to see whether legal action is possible against data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica over its role in last year's disputed presidential election, an official said Wednesday.Cambridge Analytica already is being investigated by British and U.S. authorities over allegations the firm stole data from 50 million Facebook users and used it to manipulate elections.A legal team will look into whether Cambridge Analytica was involved in what Kenya's opposition claims is a hack of the electoral commission and manipulation of results in favor of President Uhuru Kenyatta in the August election, National Super Alliance chief executive Norman Magaya said.In the Channel 4 report this week based on undercover video, Cambridge Analytica took credit for stage-managing Kenyatta's campaign. It denied any involvement in inflammatory videos targeting Kenyatta's opponents. There was no discussion of mining Facebook data.

""This is sophistications that have not been there in the Kenyan elections,"" Magaya said of the opposition claim of hacking. ""This is where Cambridge Analytica came in to help (Kenyatta's party) and even after running the propaganda campaign they were not sufficient to win an election and they resorted to manipulating election results,"" Magaya said.

        Kenyatta ended up winning a fresh election after the Supreme Court nullified the August vote over ""illegalities and irregularities."" The court said it did so partly because the electoral commission refused to allow court-appointed technology experts to scrutinize its servers.

The Cambridge Analytica developments come after Kenyatta and opposition leader Raila Odinga this month shook hands and appeared to make peace after sometimes deadly political turmoil. After Odinga boycotted the fresh election, he held a mock inauguration in January as the ""people's president.""The longtime rivals Kenyatta and Odinga announced a new initiative to deal with deep-seated hatred among communities in the East African nation, which have led to sometimes deadly tensions along ethnic lines.Odinga has been silent about Cambridge Analytica's involvement in the elections. His spokesman Dennis Onyango did not respond to requests for comment.But Odinga's party on Wednesday urged Kenyatta's party to ""come clean"" on the role Cambridge Analytica played, ""especially in the newfound spirit of dialogue in the country, so that we can openly deal with the rifts created by these political mercenaries on the fabric of Kenyan society.""

        LONDON —  Officers from Britain's information regulator are raiding the London offices of data firm Cambridge Analytica after being granted a warrant as part of an investigation into alleged misuse of personal information.A High Court judge granted the warrant Friday evening. Soon afterward, 18 people, some in Information Commissioner's Office jackets, entered the company's central London offices.The information commissioner is investigating whether the firm improperly used data from some 50 million Facebook users to target voters with ads and political messages.Cambridge Analytica, best known for working on President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign, is at the center of an international storm over privacy and political manipulation.Authorities in the United States and Britain are investigating whether it and Facebook broke the law in their use of personal information.

        BOGOTA —  Colombia, which will hold presidential elections in May, on Wednesday blocked access to a cell phone application it said might be connected with Cambridge Analytica, the political consultancy that has been accused of violating Facebook users' privacy to influence elections in Britain and the United States.Lawmakers in the United States and Europe are demanding to know more about Facebook's privacy practices after a whistleblower said Cambridge Analytica improperly accessed data to target U.S. and British voters in close-run elections.Colombia's commerce regulator said in a statement it would block an application called Pig.gi, which gives users free top-ups in exchange for receiving ads and recommending their friends. The app has more than a million downloads in Colombia and Mexico combined, the regulator said.The app, which users download via the Google Play store and sign into using their Facebook account, is administered by Farrow Colombia S.A.S and Farrow Mexico S.A.P.I. de CV, the statement said.

The regulator did not specify what evidence it had of a connection between Cambridge Analytica and Farrow. The application will be blocked on the Google Play app store and on social media, as will websites where it can be downloaded.The regulator added it has requested cooperation and information from its counterparts in the United States, United Kingdom, European Union and Mexico.Facebook announced a series of changes on Wednesday to give users more control over their data, after the scandal wiped more than $100 billion from its stock market value.Cambridge Analytica has said it did not use Facebook data in U.S. President Donald Trump's campaign, and that it had deleted all Facebook data it obtained from a third-party app in 2014 after learning the information did not adhere to data protection rules.Colombia will hold presidential elections on May 27.(Reporting by Julia Symmes Cobb and Nelson Bocanegra; Editing by David Gregorio)        Continue reading the main story

        LONDON —  Efforts by Britain's information watchdog to investigate Cambridge Analytica - the company at the center of a storm over its use of Facebook data - were delayed on Thursday when a judge adjourned for 24 hours its application to search the company's head office.The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) declined to comment on the reason for the delay.""A High Court judge has adjourned the ICO's application for a warrant relating to Cambridge Analytica until Friday,"" a spokeswoman said.ICO head Elizabeth Denham said three days ago she was seeking a warrant to access the offices of Cambridge Analytica after Britain's Channel 4 news secretly recorded its executives boasting of their ability to sway elections.Denham said then it would not take long for her organization to obtain the warrant.Several Twitter users have been questioning the delay, including Channel 4 News anchor Jon Snow who wrote before Thursday's adjournment: ""Surely unbelievable that the UK's information commissioner is STILL waiting to see a judge who will grant a warrant to go in and search the premises ... by the time she gets in there how much evidence will be left?""

The political consultancy improperly accessed Facebook users' information to build profiles on millions of American voters that were later used to help elect U.S. President Donald Trump in 2016, a whistleblower said on Saturday.Facebook's own forensic auditors - Stroz Friedberg - were in Cambridge Analytica's offices in central London on Monday to determine whether the firm still had the data, but left at the request of the British authorities.The data protection regulator had already demanded access to Cambridge Analytica's records and data - on March 7 - as part of an ongoing inquiry into how data was being used to target political messages.The Information Commissioner can currently impose fines of up to 500,000 pounds ($700,000) but will gain the power to fine an organization up to 4 percent of its global turnover when new data protection legislation comes into force in May.(Reporting by Paul Sandle; editing by Costas Pitas)        Continue reading the main story

        NEW DELHI —  India has set a March 31 deadline for London-based political consultancy Cambridge Analytica to respond to a query on whether it was engaged to improperly harvest Facebook data on Indian citizens, the information technology ministry said.India's information technology minister last week warned against any abuse of social media in elections, following reports that the analytics firm improperly accessed information on millions of Facebook users to target U.S. voters.Friday's notice to the firm followed local media reports that Indian political parties had used the data analytics firm during elections.India is preparing for a general election in 2019 and several states will elect new assemblies this year and the next.

        LONDON —  Britain's information commissioner plans to apply for a warrant to access the servers of Cambridge Analytica, which allegedly used data mined from Facebook to help Donald Trump win the 2016 presidential election.Commissioner Elizabeth Denham said in a statement Monday that she would request the warrant because Cambridge Analytica had been uncooperative with her investigation into whether the company illegally acquired and used Facebook data.""This is a complex and far-reaching investigation for my office and any criminal or civil enforcement actions arising from it will be pursued vigorously,"" she said.Denham launched her investigation after weekend reports that Cambridge Analytica improperly used information from more than 50 million Facebook accounts. Facebook has suspended the company from the social network while it investigates the claims.

        The New York Times and the U.K.'s Guardian newspaper reported that the U.K.-based company obtained Facebook account data without the users' knowledge and retained it after claiming it had been deleted. Chris Wylie, who once worked for Cambridge Analytica, was quoted as saying the company used the data to build psychological profiles so voters could be targeted with ads and stories.Cambridge Analytica says the information was acquired from a contractor who was contractually obligated to comply with data-protection laws. None of the data was used in the Trump campaign, the company said.""I'm not accepting their response so therefore I'll be applying to the court for a warrant,"" Denham told Britain's Channel 4. ""We need to get in there, we need to look at the databases, we need to look at the servers and understand how data was processed or deleted by Cambridge Analytica.""

        LONDON —  Britain is investigating whether Facebook did enough to protect data after a whistleblower said a London-based political consultancy hired by Donald Trump improperly accessed information on 50 million Facebook users to sway public opinion.Facebook shares closed down nearly 7 percent on Monday, wiping nearly $40 billion (£28.58 billion) off its market value as investors worried that damage to the reputation of the world's largest social media network would deter users and advertisers.Elizabeth Denham, the head of Britain's Information Commission, is seeking a warrant to search the offices of consultancy Cambridge Analytica after a whistleblower revealed it had harvested the private information of millions of people to support Trump's 2016 U.S. presidential campaign.""We are looking at whether or not Facebook secured and safeguarded personal information on the platform and whether when they found out about the loss of the data they acted robustly and whether or not people were informed,"" Denham told BBC Radio.

        In Washington, the Republican chairman of the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee sent a letter on Monday to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg requesting information and a briefing on the Facebook user data.""The possibility that Facebook has either not been transparent with consumers or has not been able to verify that third party app developers are transparent with consumers is troubling,"" read the letter which was also addressed to Nigel Oakes, chief executive of Cambridge Analytica's affiliate SCL.Bloomberg reported that the U.S. Federal Trade Commission is investigating Facebook. Its shares fell a further 1.8 percent.In London, the head of Britain's cross-party Media parliamentary committee also wrote to Zuckerberg asking for more information. ""We would like to receive your response by Monday 26 March,"" lawmaker Damian Collins wrote.In Dublin, Ireland's privacy watchdog said it was following up with Facebook to clarify its oversight. The Irish body is the lead regulator for Facebook in the European Union because the network's European headquarters are in Dublin.Created in 2013, Cambridge Analytica markets itself as a source of consumer research, targeted advertising and other data-related services to both political and corporate clients.According to the New York Times, it was launched with $15 million in backing from billionaire Republican donor Robert Mercer and a name chosen by the-then future Trump White House adviser Steve Bannon.

Facebook says the data were harvested by a British academic, Aleksandr Kogan, who created an app on the platform that was downloaded by 270,000 people, providing access not only to their own personal data but also their friends'.Facebook said Kogan then violated its policies by passing the data to Cambridge Analytica. Facebook has since suspended both the consulting firm and SCL (Strategic Communication Laboratories), a government and military contractor.Facebook said it had been told that the data were destroyed.Kogan says he changed the terms and conditions of his personality-test app on Facebook from academic to commercial part way through the project, according to an email to Cambridge University colleagues obtained and cited by CNN.

Kogan says Facebook made no objection, but Facebook says it was not informed of the change, CNN reported. Kogan was not immediately reachable for comment.GRAVE VIOLATION""If this data still exists, it would be a grave violation of Facebook's policies and an unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments these groups made,"" Facebook said.Cambridge Analytica has denied all the media claims and said it deleted the data after learning the information did not adhere to data protection rules.On Tuesday people were seen carrying multiple plastic storage containers into and out of the building that houses Cambridge Analytica's London office, among other companies. It was not clear which firm they were going to.""We are not alone in using data from social media sites to extract user information,"" Cambridge Analytica said. ""No Facebook data was used by our data science team in the 2016 presidential campaign.""Denham, head of the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO)  said on Monday she was seeking a warrant to access the offices of Cambridge Analytica after seeing an investigation by Britain's Channel 4 news which secretly recorded its executives boasting of their ability to sway elections.

She said it would not take long to obtain the warrant.""We have offered to share with the ICO all the information that it asked for and for the ICO to attend our office voluntarily, subject to our agreeing the scope of the inspection,"" Cambridge Analytica said.Facebook said it had hired forensic auditors from the firm Stroz Friedberg to investigate and determine whether Cambridge Analytica still had the data. The auditors were in Cambridge Analytica's offices on Monday night but left at the request of the British authorities.The Information Commissioner can currently impose fines of up to 500,000 pounds but will gain the power to fine an organisation up to 4 percent of its global turnover when new data protection legislation comes into force in May.The criticism of Cambridge Analytica presents a new threat to Facebook, which is already under attack over Russia's alleged use of Facebook tools to sway U.S. voters with divisive and false news posts before and after the 2016 election.""This story comes on the back of increasing scrutiny and societal unease with FB's potential impact on kids as well as increasing concerns around the power of mega cap Internet names, setting the stage for deeper investigation,"" Deutsche Bank analyst Lloyd Walmsley wrote in a note, keeping his ""buy"" rating on Facebook stock.Walmsley said he was worried ""about how scrutiny could ultimately impact Facebook's ability to gather and deploy data for ad targeting, which has been critical to ad efficacy and budget growth"".The company said last month it had 1.4 billion active daily users, up 14 percent from a year earlier. But the number of daily users in the United States and Canada fell for the first time in its history, dipping in the company's home market by 700,000 from a quarter earlier to 184 million.(Additional reporting by Doina Chiacu in Washington; editing by David Stamp; Editing by Guy Faulconbridge and David Stamp)        Continue reading the main story

        LONDON —  Britain is very concerned over allegations that the data firm Cambridge Analytica exploited Facebook data to use millions of people's profiles without authorization, a spokesman for Prime Minister Theresa May said on Monday.""The allegations are clearly very concerning. It is essential that people can have confidence that their personal data will be protected and used in an appropriate way,"" the spokesman told reporters.""So it is absolutely right that the Information Commissioner is investigating this matter. We expect Facebook, Cambridge Analytica and all the organizations involved to cooperate fully.""(Reporting By Elizabeth Piper.

        LONDON —  Cambridge Analytica, the UK political consultancy at the center of Facebook's election manipulation scandal, ran the campaigns of President Uhuru Kenyatta in the 2013 and 2017 Kenyan elections, according to video secretly recorded and broadcast by Britain's Channel 4 News on Monday.The company denied all allegations made by Channel 4 News regarding its business practices.The news channel said it mounted a “sting operation” in which it said had secretly recorded top Cambridge Analytica executives saying they could use bribes, former spies and Ukrainian sex workers to entrap politicians around the world.The New York Times and the British Observer newspaper reported on Saturday that Cambridge Analytica had acquired private data harvested from more than 50 million Facebook users to support Donald Trump's 2016 presidential election campaign.Mark Turnbull, a managing director for Cambridge Analytica and sister company SCL Elections, told Channel 4's undercover investigative reporting team that his firm secretly stage-managed Kenyatta's hotly contested campaigns to run the East African nation.

""We have rebranded the entire party twice, written the manifesto, done research, analysis, messaging. I think we wrote all the speeches and we staged the whole thing - so just about every element of this candidate,"" Turnbull said of his firm's work for Kenyatta's political party, known as the National Alliance until 2016, and subsequently as the Jubilee Party.

        Kenyatta came to power in 2013 and won a second and final term last August, defeating opposition leader Raila Odinga by 1.4 million votes. The Supreme Court nullified the vote citing procedural irregularities and ordered a second election.Last September, former U.S. presidential candidate Hillary Clinton called the second election a ""project"" of Cambridge Analytica. The Jubilee Party has not commented.Odinga did not contest the repeat vote on Oct. 26, saying it would be unfair because the election commission had failed to implement reforms and Kenyatta won with 98 percent of the vote.At a prior meeting, Turnbull told the reporters: ""Our job is to really drop the bucket further down the well than anybody else to understand what are these really deep-seated fears, concerns. ""It is no good fighting an election campaign on the facts, because actually it is all about emotion.""

        LONDON —  A British parliamentary committee has recalled the suspended chief executive of Cambridge Analytica to face further questions over his role in the harvesting of Facebook data after finding ""inconsistencies"" in his previous testimony.The world's largest social media network has been rocked this week by a whistleblower who said that the London-based political consultancy Cambridge Analytica improperly accessed user information to build profiles on American voters that were later used to help elect U.S. President Donald Trump in 2016.The media select committee said they wanted to put more questions to Alexander Nix, the suspended CEO of Cambridge Analytica, after he previously told the parliamentary group he had not received Facebook data from a third party.""Giving false statements to a Select Committee is a very serious matter,"" Damian Collins, the chair of the committee, wrote in a letter to Nix.

            2. Other comings and goings in Washington:Andrew McCabe, above, who was fired as F.B.I. deputy director days before his retirement, kept contemporaneous memos on his interactions with President Trump and his former boss, James Comey. Mr. McCabe was among the first officials to scrutinize the possible links between Russia and the Trump team and came under repeated attack from Mr. Trump.

        There were rumors that the president would fire other members of his cabinet, but they didn’t materialize. Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, made it known that he’d be ready to replace Attorney General Jeff Sessions should the position open.____Photo

            3. President Trump boasted that he insisted to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada, above, that the U.S. runs a trade deficit with his country — without knowing whether that was true.Our White House correspondent says the episode goes to the heart of a fundamental debate about Mr. Trump: When does he know the things he says are false and when is he simply misinformed?And Mr. Trump’s lawyers filed court papers claiming that Stephanie Clifford, the pornographic film actress who alleges she had an affair with him, could be liable for $20 million in damages for violating a nondisclosure pact.____Photo

            4. Just hours before a pedestrian bridge collapsed in Miami on Thursday, the company that engineered it told university officials a crack had not compromised its structural integrity.At least six people were killed when the newly installed bridge, intended to connect Florida International University and the city of Sweetwater, collapsed onto the roadway below. It had not yet opened to the public.We talked to people who saw the bridge come down and looked at how it was built, using a method called accelerated construction.

            5. Russia goes to the polls on Sunday, and Vladimir Putin is expected to win a fourth presidential term by a wide margin. The question is how high turnout will be. Above, a campaign billboard.Meanwhile, the diplomatic crisis over the poisoning of a former Russian spy in Britain intensified.Britain’s foreign minister, Boris Johnson, said it was “overwhelmingly likely” that Mr. Putin had personally ordered the attack, which was carried out using a military-grade nerve agent. After Britain ordered 23 Russian diplomats to leave, Moscow responded in kind.____Photo

            6. A $100 million federal study is now underway that could provide medical evidence needed to recommend a daily alcoholic drink as part of a healthy lifestyle. (Above, a happy drinker in Philadelphia in 1907.)And alcohol companies are paying for most of it, through donations to a private foundation that raises money for the National Institutes of Health.Using a Freedom of Information Act request, we obtained documents showing that the institute waged a vigorous campaign to court the alcohol industry. It even paid for scientists to travel to meetings with executives, where they gave talks strongly suggesting that the study’s results would endorse moderate drinking as healthy.____Photo

            7. March Madness saw the ultimate upset.A No. 16 seed — the Retrievers of the University of Maryland, Baltimore County — beat the top-seeded Virginia Cavaliers, 74-54, on Friday.Our college sports reporter said the defeat was a long time coming. “The Retrievers played on the vulnerabilities Virginia had all along, and that had made many doubt whether the Cavaliers could truly make a deep tournament run,” he wrote.U.M.B.C. is better known for academics than for team sports. “The symbolism of last night is that my young men went out there to be the best that they can be, and believed in themselves, against all odds,” its president said.

            8. Tuesday is the vernal equinox in the Northern Hemisphere, otherwise known as the first day of spring.In this season, our minds turn to preparations for summer. And while some of us might grimace thinking of that lapsed gym membership, imagine what hibernating animals go through.Here’s a look at what black bears, bees and other creatures do when they wake from winter’s long slumber.____Photo

        NEW YORK —  Facebook Inc and the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica have been sued in the United States for obtaining information belonging to 50 million of the social media company's users without permission.The proposed class-action complaint filed late Tuesday night by Lauren Price, a Maryland resident, is the first of what could be many lawsuits seeking damages over Facebook's ability to protect user data, and Cambridge Analytica's exploitation of that data to benefit President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign.""Every Facebook user has an interest in this lawsuit, and the enforcement of their privacy rights,"" John Yanchunis, a lawyer for Price, said in a phone interview on Wednesday.The complaint was filed in the U.S. District Court in San Jose, California, several hours after Facebook was blamed in a shareholder lawsuit filed in nearby San Francisco for the drop in its stock price after the data harvesting was revealed. Nearly $50 billion of market value was wiped out in two days.

""Our client saw a tremendous uptick in political messaging during the campaign on her Facebook page, which she had never seen,"" Yanchunis said. ""She had a glimmer of understanding at the time, but now sees there was an attempt to influence her vote.""The complaint seeks unspecified damages, including possible punitive damages.Yanchunis, who has also been suing Verizon Communications Inc over data breaches at its Yahoo Internet business affecting 3 billion accounts, said it should be a ""fairly easy exercise"" to identify potential Facebook class members.He said cybersecurity experts can assist with the case, and that Facebook ""leaves a footprint of what was taken that cannot be erased.""The case is Price v Facebook Inc et al, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 18-01732. The shareholder case is Yuan v Facebook Inc et al in the same court, No. 18-01725.(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Additional reporting by Eric Auchard in London; Editing by Nick Zieminski)        Continue reading the main story

        LONDON —  Cambridge University said it wanted Facebook to confirm its academic Alex Kogan used no university data, resources or facilities at a time when the social network says he violated its rules by passing user information on to Cambridge Analytica.The data was used by Cambridge Analytica, a company unconnected to the British university, to target the delivery of political messages in Donald Trump's presidential campaign, according to a whistleblower.""We have previously sought and received assurances from Dr Kogan that no University data, resources or facilities were used as the basis for his work with GSR or the company's subsequent work with any other party,"" the university said on Tuesday, referring to Kogan's own commercial enterprise.""We have to date found no evidence to contradict Dr Kogan's previous assurances. Nevertheless, we are writing to Facebook to request all relevant evidence in their possession.""(Reporting by Paul Sandle; editing by Kate Holton)        Continue reading the main story

        LONDON —  Brexit campaigner Arron Banks said Cambridge Analytica pitched for work with the Leave.eu campaign ahead of the 2016 Brexit referendum but that ultimately it never did any work - paid or otherwise - for the campaign.""We did have dealings with Cambridge Analytica – they put forward a pitch that went into the designation document submitted to the electoral commission,"" Banks told Reuters.As Leave.eu did not win the designation as the official leave campaign and due to concerns about the London-based consultancy, no work was done with Cambridge Analytica, Banks said.""Of course we didn't win the designation therefore we didn’t go ahead with them,"" Banks said by telephone. ""We had plenty of talks with them but we never did any work paid or otherwise.""

        It was the first known pedestrian fatality from a driverless vehicle on a public road.While autonomous cars are expected to ultimately be safer, they face a serious challenge in trying to match the human ability to adjust for unpredictable driving or behavior. In this case, the woman was crossing the street outside of a crosswalk.____Photo

            3. Some of the targets of President Trump’s insult-laden attacks are striking back.Among them are James Comey and Andrew McCabe, whose firings from the F.B.I. by Mr. Trump are being examined by the special counsel. John Brennan, a former C.I.A. director, used particularly harsh language, responding to a Trump tweet this way: “When the full extent of your venality, moral turpitude, and political corruption becomes known, you will take your rightful place as a disgraced demagogue in the dustbin of history.”Above, the president in New Hampshire on Monday.Here’s what we know about Mr. McCabe’s firing last week, and The Daily podcast talks to Matt Apuzzo, our reporter following Mr. Trump’s attacks on the F.B.I._____Photo

            4. Austin, Tex., is on high alert as the police search for a “serial bomber” responsible for four explosions this month, including one on Sunday night.Here’s a quick rundown of the blasts, which have killed two people and hurt four others.The latest explosion came hours after law enforcement officials made an unusually direct appeal to the perpetrator of the first three blasts._____Photo

            5. A 31-year-old college dropout may be in line to become Italy’s next prime minister.The unlikely rise of Luigi Di Maio, above at center left, reflects the country’s newly turbulent politics. There is a very real possibility that his Five Star Movement, which won a stunning victory in recent elections, will ally with the anti-immigrant, hard-right League.In the U.S., another political newcomer wants to shake things up: Cynthia Nixon, an education activist known for her acting in “Sex and the City,” will challenge Gov. Andrew Cuomo in New York’s Democratic primary.

            6. Six months after two big hurricanes blitzed through the Caribbean, our Travel desk sent writers there to measure the recovery.They report from Vieques; St. Martin; St. John; and Dominica, above. Our story from San Juan will be posted Tuesday.Despite the pain, some found notes of hope. “If you take the long view, Vieques will end up better off,” a biologist there said. “We have a chance to create tourism that’s more community-oriented, more nature-oriented, that can preserve and conserve the island, that’s more sustainable.”_____Photo

            7. Player trades have an enormous role in professional sports. They shake up teams, excite fans and make or break front offices’ reputations.But now they could be a lot more expensive. A single word in the Republican tax law — “real” — may prevent sports organizations from avoiding taxes when they exchange players. Above, Justin Verlander._____Photo
    
            
    8. A sweeping new study shows the punishing effects of racism on black boys.White boys who grow up rich are likely to remain that way. But black boys raised at the top are more likely to become poor as adults than to stay wealthy. And that gap is not replicated for white and black girls.In Minneapolis, school officials are struggling to figure out why the district suspends an inordinate number of black students compared with white ones._____Photo

That’s the voice of Hannah Gadsby, an Australian stand-up comedian who has channeled the righteous anger of the #MeToo movement. Our columnist writes that “the laughs of her show are a means to an end, which is, at its core, a ferocious attack on comedy itself.”Mocking the saying that comedy is the best medicine, she says: “I reckon penicillin might give it a nudge. Your baby is sick? Just give it a tickle.”

            10. Finally,  here’s a positive story about internet sleuthing.This half-century-old photo is of 38 scientists, 37 of them men. The only person not named for all this time was a young black woman, partly obscured above at center left.An illustrator doing research for a book asked Twitter for help. The move paid off: Sheila Minor Huff, now 71, is a retired grandmother of five who lives in Virginia and does a bit of belly dancing.She wasn’t especially bothered about going unnamed. “It’s kind of like, no big deal,” she said. “When I try to do good, when I try and add back to this wonderful earth that we have, when I try to protect it, does it matter that anybody knows my name?”Have a great night._____

SAN FRANCISCO — Facebook’s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, on Wednesday publicly addressed for the first time the misuse of data belonging to 50 million users of the social network and described the steps the company would take to safeguard the information of its more than two billion monthly users.Although his statement addressing a chorus of criticism fell short of a full-throated apology, Mr. Zuckerberg said that Facebook would contact users whose data had been harvested through a personality quiz app and passed along to the political data firm Cambridge Analytica.“We have a responsibility to protect your data,” Mr. Zuckerberg said Wednesday in a Facebook post, “and if we can’t then we don’t deserve to serve you.”Mr. Zuckerberg, 33, was trying to quell the crisis over the disclosure last weekend that Cambridge Analytica had used data that had been improperly obtained from Facebook as the firm worked on behalf of Donald J. Trump’s presidential campaign.

“Are there other Cambridge Analyticas out there?” Mr. Zuckerberg said later in an interview with The New York Times. He added, “Were there apps which could have gotten access to more information and potentially sold it without us knowing or done something that violated people’s trust? We also need to make sure we get that under control.”        Continue reading the main story

        Mr. Zuckerberg said the company would investigate apps like the third-party quiz app that had previously obtained access to “large amounts of information” from the social network. He also said the company would restrict third-party developers’ access.Video


    
    Why Leaving Facebook Doesn’t Always Mean Quitting

        
            
                In the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, in which data from over 50 million Facebook profiles was secretly scraped and mined for voter insights, many Facebook users have decided to delete their accounts — but untangling yourself from a site like Facebook is not as easy as pressing “delete.”

    “We also made mistakes, there’s more to do, and we need to step up and do it,” he wrote in his Facebook statement.The Cambridge Analytica revelations added to the questions that have been raised about Facebook’s handling of user data and security. Those questions have only intensified as the company has faced criticism over the role its platform played in Russian attempts to influence the 2016 presidential election and the way it has been used to spread misinformation on the internet.The resulting backlash is Facebook’s worst crisis since it was founded by Mr. Zuckerberg and others in 2004. The information, photos and other content that users post and their frequent engagement with the platform is crucial to the social network, and to the company’s profitability. Questions about user privacy and security threaten the company’s standing at a time when people are already uneasy about whether the use of technology can bring good or ill.Last Friday, after The New York Times, The Observer of London and Channel 4 in Britain told Facebook that Cambridge Analytica had not deleted all of the data it had obtained, the social network banned the political consulting firm and Aleksandr Kogan, the Cambridge University researcher who created the personality quiz app that was used to harvest user data.“This was a breach of trust between Kogan, Cambridge Analytica and Facebook,” Mr. Zuckerberg wrote on Wednesday. “But it was also a breach of trust between Facebook and the people who share their data with us and expect us to protect it.”Facebook representatives confirmed that Cambridge Analytica representatives met with Facebook on Tuesday to discuss lifting the ban. Mr. Zuckerberg told The Times he did not rule out allowing Cambridge Analytica back, saying Facebook must first conduct a “full forensic audit of the firm” and “have full confirmation that there’s no wrongdoing here.”

The reaction to the Cambridge Analytica disclosure has been severe. Politicians in the United States and Britain have called for Mr. Zuckerberg to explain how his company handles user data, and state attorneys general in Massachusetts and New York have begun investigating Cambridge Analytica and Facebook. A #DeleteFacebook movement calling on people to close their accounts has also gathered steam.

In Washington, there have been more calls for regulation of internet companies like Facebook. Mr. Zuckerberg’s troubles there were illustrated by the final passage on Wednesday of a bill to combat sex trafficking. The bill would lift liability protections that internet companies have enjoyed for content that users post on their platforms. Facebook and other internet giants had quietly fought the bill for more than a year, but eventually dropped their opposition.Lawmakers who have demanded that Mr. Zuckerberg testify before Congress about Facebook’s relationship with Cambridge Analytica were not appeased by his statement.“You need to come to Congress and testify to this under oath,” Senator Ed Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, tweeted in response to Mr. Zuckerberg’s post.Independent researchers who have used data from Facebook said that Mr. Zuckerberg’s statement did not acknowledge how the gathering of user data was fundamental to the company’s operations.“He avoided the big issue, which is that for many years, Facebook was basically giving away user data like it was handing out candy,” said Jonathan Albright, research director at the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University. “There is no question that handing out that data made Facebook the success it is as a company. This has to be recognized as part of their business model and not just a one-off problem.”In his statement, Mr. Zuckerberg laid out a timeline of Facebook’s dealings with Cambridge Analytica. He traced the information-sharing issue to 2007, when Facebook decided to become an open platform — enabling people to use Facebook to log into other apps and share detailed personal information about themselves and their friends.In 2013, Mr. Kogan, the Cambridge researcher, created a personality quiz app that about 300,000 people installed, Mr. Zuckerberg wrote. Because Facebook was an open platform, Mr. Kogan was able to collect data on tens of millions of friends of those users who had installed the personality quiz app.

A year later, Mr. Zuckerberg said, Facebook changed its policy to limit how much data third-party apps could access. “These actions would prevent any app like Kogan’s from being able to access so much data today,” he wrote.By 2015, Mr. Kogan had shared his data and findings with Cambridge Analytica, which later used the material to single out American voters. Mr. Zuckerberg said Facebook had banned Mr. Kogan’s app and demanded that the researcher and Cambridge Analytica formally certify that the data had been deleted. He did not address in his post why Facebook had not already disclosed those activities to its users whose data had been harvested by Mr. Kogan and Cambridge Analytica.“Whenever there’s an issue where someone’s data gets passed to someone who the rules of the system shouldn’t have allowed it to, that’s rightfully a big issue and deserves to be a big uproar,” Mr. Zuckerberg said in the interview.For Mr. Zuckerberg, the outcry over Cambridge Analytica has been personally damaging. Inside Facebook, even his staunch supporters have described a tense atmosphere. Some employees have sought to transfer to other divisions, such as the messaging app WhatsApp and the photo-sharing platform Instagram, calling their work on Facebook’s main product “demoralizing.”Mr. Zuckerberg spent part of the past week hunkered down with a small group of engineers to discuss how to make information on Facebook’s users more secure, and to potentially give them more control of their data, according to two Facebook employees who declined to be named because the proceedings were confidential.His silence on the matter has prompted mounting criticism in the past few days. Facebook held a staff meeting on Tuesday to answer questions about Cambridge Analytica and the surrounding outcry, but Mr. Zuckerberg did not appear at the event. He was scheduled to appear at a staff meeting that was set for Friday.

In his interview with The Times, Mr. Zuckerberg said that the company’s efforts to safeguard its platform from bad behavior — which includes preparing for possible interference attempts in the 2018 midterm elections — were an important part of a larger transformation at the company, which has had to adjust from its roots as a social network for college students into a powerful global information hub.“If you had asked me, when I got started with Facebook, if one of the central things I’d need to work on now is preventing governments from interfering in each other’s elections, there’s no way I thought that’s what I’d be doing if we talked in 2004 in my dorm room,” Mr. Zuckerberg said.

LONDON — Two senior advisers to Prime Minister Theresa May might have conspired to bypass electoral spending laws when they were leading a campaign for Britain to leave the European Union, a former employee of their effort said this week, in an interview and in testimony he gave to the country’s elections regulator.The allegations led to a heated exchange, conducted in the British news media, involving allegations of hard feelings over an old romance and of the deliberate outing by the prime minister’s office, No. 10 Downing Street, of the former employee as gay.The former employee, Shahmir Sanni, said in the interview and in a witness statement submitted to the regulator, the Electoral Commission, that the two advisers had funneled more than $900,000 in campaign spending through a puppet organization that they had set up. They did so, he said, by paying the money to a digital advertising firm that was indirectly linked to the Trump campaign and also worked on the push to exit the European Union.Mr. Sanni volunteered at Vote Leave, the main campaign led in part by the two advisers to the prime minister, and then at the organization that he now says was a puppet, called BeLeave. He spoke with The New York Times for a joint reporting project with The Observer of Britain.

The allegations are the latest of many raised on both sides of the referendum about the possible diversion of money through allied organizations to get around funding limits on each of them, and campaign finance experts said the multitude of such claims pointed to holes and ambiguities in the regulations that governed the referendum.

        In response, one of the two Downing Street advisers, Stephen Parkinson, said that Vote Leave had adhered to all relevant laws. Mr. Parkinson also suggested that Mr. Sanni was lashing out because the two had “dated for 18 months, before splitting up — I thought amicably — in September 2017.”He said he had not spoken to Mr. Sanni as a supervisor from the Vote Leave campaign, but as a friend. “That is the capacity in which I gave Shahmir advice and encouragement, and I can understand if the lines became blurred for him,” Mr. Parkinson said in the statement, “but I am clear that I did not direct the activities of any separate campaign groups.”The other adviser, Cleo Watson, could not be reached for comment.Mr. Sanni said his relationship with Mr. Parkinson had been a short fling that started after the referendum. In a statement, he said the disclosure of his sexual orientation had endangered his family, who live in Pakistan, and he accused Mr. Parkinson of intimidation.“I never imagined that he, with the help of No. 10, would choose to tell the world I am gay, in a last, desperate attempt to scare me,” Mr. Sanni said.His lawyer, Tamsin Allen, said in a statement, “We believe this is the first time a Downing Street official statement has been used to out someone.”British campaign finance experts said the allegations about Vote Leave underscored the porousness and ineffectiveness of rules on spending around referendums like the vote in 2016 to exit the European Union.Photo

            “They were useless,” said Justin Fisher, a professor of political science at Brunel University London who has studied the regulations for the Electoral Commission, which oversees elections and regulates political finance in Britain.

Multiple organizations, each with its own spending limit, were allowed to campaign in parallel on either side of the referendum issue, and they were allowed to work together in ill-defined ways, allowing donors on either side many ways to sidestep spending limits, Mr. Fisher noted.The rules “had never really been tested before because we never had a referendum of any consequence before,” Mr. Fisher said, noting that in total the supporters of remaining in the European Union had outspent the advocates of leaving.Mr. Sanni’s allegations have come to light because of a tangle of connections to an online consulting company with ties to the campaign that elected President Trump — Cambridge Analytica.Mr. Sanni is friends with Christopher Wylie, a former research director of Cambridge Analytica who has recently provided information to journalists indicating that the company improperly obtained  the data of 50 million Facebook users in order to help target voters.The Vote Leave campaign relied heavily for online ad placement on a Canadian company called AggregateIQ, which according to documents and testimony submitted to the Electoral Commission by Mr. Wylie was a satellite business set up to support Cambridge Analytica.Public filings also show that Vote Leave provided virtually the entire $990,000 budget of BeLeave — 625,000 pounds — which took the form of additional spending paid directly to AggregateIQ.As Mr. Wylie was coming forward with his disclosures about Cambridge Analytica, he encouraged his friend Mr. Sanni to come forward with his claims about Vote Leave and BeLeave as well.

Testimony and documents provided by Mr. Wylie in his filing to the Electoral Commission show that AggregateIQ was founded in 2013 in discussion with executives at Cambridge Analytica’s parent company, initially licensed all its software from that company, and for a time received virtually all its income from the company.In a statement this week, Jeff Silvester, one of the founders of AggregateIQ, said it was a “digital advertising, web and software development company” and “has never managed, nor did we ever have access to, any Facebook data or database allegedly obtained improperly by Cambridge Analytica.”

Mr. Silvester did not address the company’s work for Vote Leave and BeLeave. A spokesman for Cambridge Analytica did not respond to a request for comment.An initial investigation by the Electoral Commission found nothing improper in the relationship between the two organizations, but a court appeal last fall prompted the commission to reopen its inquiry. Mr. Sanni’s testimony is additional information recently submitted to that ongoing inquiry.Photo

            He and Mr. Wylie also gave the commission records showing that anyone at Vote Leave continued to have access to the Google Drive used for BeLeave’s strategy, planning and internal discussion after the referendum, on June 23, 2016.Mr. Sanni graduated from the University of East Anglia at the end of 2015, and began volunteering the next March for the Vote Leave campaign. He worked with a small team of young volunteers in what was then a unit of Vote Leave called BeLeave that tried to craft messages to turn young and liberal people against the European Union by arguing, for example, that it closed doors to the non-European world.The small BeLeave team initially worked in the same office as Vote Leave and under the oversight of its senior staff, including Mr. Parkinson and Ms. Watson, as did two AggregateIQ employees managing the campaign’s online advertising, Mr. Sanni testified to the commission.By mid-May, however, with the referendum little more than a month away, the Vote Leave campaign was nearing its spending cap.At about the same time, the leaders of the Vote Leave campaign instructed their lawyers to draw up a charter for BeLeave to become an independent group. Mr. Sanni was named its secretary and research director while another friend, Darren Grimes, was named its principal and campaign director.Mr. Sanni told the commission he was surprised to learn that the leaders of Vote Leave had also decided to direct $900,000 to BeLeave, given that it was overseen by two unpaid, inexperienced people: He and Mr. Grimes were then both 22. But then his friend Mr. Grimes explained that virtually all of that money would be paid directly to AggregateIQ for online advertising.

In practice, Mr. Sanni said, nothing changed. The BeLeave staff continued to work inside the Vote Leave office. The senior officials of Vote Leave continued to approve their messages. And the same AggregateIQ workers continued to place BeLeave’s online advertisements while providing the same service to Vote Leave.“We never saw ourselves as a separate organization from the get-go,” Mr. Sanni said in an interview, echoing his testimony. “We were just volunteers.”The money paid to AggregateIQ for online advertising produced few results for BeLeave — 1,164 email sign-ups and 1,005 mobile phone numbers for more than $900,000 — leading Mr. Sanni to suspect the money may have gone to promote the larger Vote Leave campaign instead.He insisted in the interview that the reason he provided testimony to the commission was not about any past feelings for Mr. Parkinson, now at No. 10.Instead, he said, it was out of concern for Mr. Grimes, the other young volunteer. By making Mr. Grimes the nominal owner of BeLeave, the leaders of Vote Leave had made him a target of critical news coverage and potential legal claims, Mr. Sanni argued. “He is getting thrown to the dogs,” Mr. Sanni said. “Everything I am doing is to protect Darren.”“I now feel sick about what happened,” Mr. Sanni said in his testimony. The officials of Vote Leave “used two 22-year-olds to cheat in the referendum.”Mr. Grimes did not respond to messages seeking comment.

"77","Facebook’s Apology, and Next Steps","AdvertisementLettersSupported byLettersFacebook’s Apology, and Next StepsImageMark Zuckerberg, chief executive officer and founder of Facebook Inc., in July.CreditDrew Angerer/Getty ImagesMarch 22, 2018To the Editor:Re “Facebook’s Chief Admits Mistakes in Guarding Data” (front page, March 22): Bravo to Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, for apologizing for his mistake. “But that’s the least we can expect,” one might argue. Yes, it is, but it’s still a rare occurrence in business and elsewhere.“They’re still just words,” goes another objection. “He needs to back up his apology with a strategy for correcting his company’s mistakes.” Yes, he does. Nevertheless, it behooves us all to acknowledge Mr. Zuckerberg’s willingness to take responsibility for Facebook’s grave errors and to make sure they don’t happen again.The more we recognize a leader’s courage in being accountable, the more likely it is that accountability will be valued and cultivated.BRUCE WEINSTEIN, NEW YORKTo the Editor:Facebook claims “it’s free and always will be.” Recent events once again prove that if you don’t have to pay for a product, you are the product. Perhaps people might be willing to pay a small monthly fee for a more secure social network service that protects their data from companies like Cambridge Analytica.KAREN SMITH, BROOKLYNTo the Editor:Various Times articles over the past several days rightly focus on the misuse of private Facebook data by Cambridge Analytica on behalf of the Trump presidential campaign. However, a key point is not being mentioned: The formulas developed by Cambridge Analytica to explain and predict people’s personality traits and behaviors are most likely hogwash.For over 40 years I have worked for academic and public and private sector organizations as a specialist in personality assessment for the purpose of explaining and predicting behaviors.In all of my endeavors I have never achieved anything close to the level of explanatory and predictive robustness claimed by Cambridge Analytica, despite using an arsenal of data collected, with permission, from all job applicants.Therefore, in my opinion, Cambridge Analytica most likely “sold a bill of goods” to the Trump campaign, using mountains of correlation data. My advice to President Trump is to request a refund.PETER D. LIFTON, BOSTONThe writer is an adjunct faculty member at Northeastern University and the retired deputy chief of the C.I.A. Office of Medical Services Applicant Evaluation Division.To the Editor:We are now starting to learn about Cambridge Analytica and efforts by wealthy authoritarians around the world to combine thievery and technology to subvert democratic elections. These efforts allow the will of voters to be thwarted.Our country needs to look at its own unique vulnerability in presidential elections. In other countries, where the winner is the one with the most votes, cheaters have a much tougher time because they must target the entire country.Not so in the United States with our Electoral College. Here the bad actors must merely focus on a few swing states and shift a small number of votes. To protect future presidential elections from this kind of fraud, we need to get rid of the Electoral College. As a side effect, my vote in California for president will actually count for something.MIKE FANNING, SAN FRANCISCOTo the Editor:As part of his sincere apology for failing to block improper use of Facebook data to attempt to influence elections, Mark Zuckerberg should make hefty donations to help states safeguard voting systems. Words alone are both hollow and inadequate.MARCIA SCULLY, WHITTIER, CALIF.To the Editor:Re “Facebook’s Surveillance Machine” (Op-Ed, nytimes.com, March 19): Zeynep Tufekci writes, “Facebook even creates ‘shadow profiles’ of nonusers. That is, even if you are not on Facebook, the company may well have compiled a profile of you, inferred from data provided by your friends or from other data.”In other words, even though I quit Facebook years ago, Cambridge Analytica may have a “shadow profile” of me thanks to Facebook’s business model.Since I quit Facebook, I’ve had no trouble getting two new jobs, getting three new apartments, buying a car, getting engaged, meeting new people, or spending time with friends and family. Despite what others claim, Facebook is not an “essential” tool. Get it out of your life, before it ruins mine!JONATHAN CAREY, HOBOKEN, N.J.Advertisement",683

        Perhaps at some point in the past few years you’ve told Facebook that you like, say, Kim Kardashian West. When you hit the thumbs-up button on her page, you probably did it because you wanted to see the reality TV star’s posts in your news feed. Maybe you realized that marketers could target advertisements to you based on your interest in her.What you probably missed is that researchers had figured out how to tie your interest in Ms. Kardashian West to certain personality traits, such as how extroverted you are (very), how conscientious (more than most) and how open-minded (only somewhat). And when your fondness for Ms. Kardashian West is combined with other interests you’ve indicated on Facebook, researchers believe their algorithms can predict the nuances of your political views with better accuracy than your loved ones.As The New York Times reported on Saturday, that is what motivated the consulting firm Cambridge Analytica to collect data from more than 50 million Facebook users, without their consent, to build its own behavioral models to target potential voters in various political campaigns. The company has worked for a political action committee started by John R. Bolton, who served in the George W. Bush administration, as well as for President Trump’s presidential campaign in 2016. “We find your voters and move them to action,” the firm boasts on its website.Cambridge Analytica now says it has destroyed the user data it collected on Facebook. Raw data reviewed by The Times suggests the information, or copies of it, may still exist. In either case, specific user information was merely a means to an end, a building block in a far more ambitious construction: a behavioral model powerful enough to manipulate people’s activity and, potentially, sway elections.

The firm adapted its approach to personality modeling from studies conducted by researchers at Stanford University and the Psychometrics Center at the University of Cambridge. The studies relied on data collected by a Facebook app called myPersonality, a 100-question quiz developed by the Psychometrics Center that assessed a person’s openness, conscientiousness, extroversion, agreeableness and neuroticism, traits commonly referred to in the academic community by the acronym Ocean.

        Many respondents who took the quiz through the myPersonality app authorized it to gain access to their Facebook profile data, and information about their friend network — access that was allowed by the social network at the time. That allowed researchers to cross-reference the results of the quiz — numeric Ocean scores — with the users’ Facebook “likes,” and build a model from the correlations they found between the two. With that model, the researchers could often make precise guesses about subsequent users’ personalities using only a list of their likes, no 100-question quiz necessary.One of the studies the Psychometrics Center produced, published in 2015 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, was built on the “likes” and Ocean scores of more than 70,000 respondents who took the myPersonality quiz on Facebook. It found that a person who liked the movie “Fight Club,” for example, was far more likely to be open to new experiences than a person who liked “American Idol,” according to a review of data provided to The Times by Michal Kosinski, an author of the 2015 study and a professor of organizational behavior at Stanford.

      Researchers at Stanford University and Cambridge University’s Psychometrics Center built a model that could assess a person’s personality using Facebook “likes” alone. The model can use the likes to score a person’s openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness and neuroticism.

In that study, the researchers compared the accuracy of their model with personality assessments made by the respondents’ friends. The friends were given a 10-question version of the myPersonality quiz and asked to answer based on their knowledge of the respondents’ personalities.Based on a sample of more than 32,000 participants who were assessed by both the model and one or two friends, the researchers found that the model, using just 10 likes, was more accurate than a work colleague. With 70 likes, it was more accurate than a friend or roommate; with 150, more accurate than a family member; and with 300, more accurate than a spouse.The model, the researchers said, was particularly adept at “predicting life outcomes such as substance use, political attitudes and physical health.” The real-world efficacy of the approach, however, has been called into question.

When Cambridge Analytica approached the Psychometrics Center about using its models, the center declined. Cambridge Analytica then turned to Aleksandr Kogan, a psychology professor at Cambridge University who was familiar with the center’s work. Dr. Kogan developed a Facebook app called “thisisyourdigitallife,” a quiz similar to myPersonality, and used it to harvest data from more than 50 million Facebook profiles. Of those, 30 million contained enough information to generate personality profiles. Only 270,000 users authorized Dr. Kogan’s app to have access to their data, and all were told that their information was being used for academic research.Cambridge then pitched its services to potential political and commercial clients, ranging from Mastercard and the New York Yankees to the Joint Chiefs of Staff.Facebook has now banned Cambridge Analytica from its platform, as well as its parent company and Dr. Kogan. In Facebook’s eyes, Dr. Kogan’s infraction was not collecting the data, but giving it to Cambridge Analytica.

“Although Kogan gained access to this information in a legitimate way and through the proper channels that governed all developers on Facebook at that time, he did not subsequently abide by our rules,” Facebook’s deputy general counsel said in a statement on Friday.By handing over that information to a private company, Facebook said, Dr. Kogan violated its terms of service.Facebook in 2015 changed its policies, including altering rules about how third-party apps can gain access to information about users’ friends. But user data collected through such apps over the years probably remains in the wild, not to mention the models that can continue to be used to target people around the world.
    
         Correction: March 23, 2018  An earlier version of this article misstated the title of Michal Kosinski, a researcher who helped develop the model that created personality profiles from Facebook “likes.” He is a professor of organizational behavior, not a professor of computer science.

"80","How Democracy Can Survive Big Data","AdvertisementSunday ReviewSupported byThe StoneHow Democracy Can Survive Big DataImageCreditIllustration by Yoshi Sodeoka; Photographs by Flashpop/Digitalvision, via Getty ImagesBy Colin KoopmanMarch 22, 2018Only a few years ago, the idea that for-profit companies and foreign agents could use powerful data technologies to disrupt American democracy would have seemed laughable to most, a plotline from a Cold War espionage movie. And the idea that the American system would be compromised enough to allow outside meddling with the most basic of its democratic functions — the election of its leaders — would have seemed even more absurd.Today we know that this is not fiction but fact. It is a secret so open that even its perpetrators seem halfhearted about hiding it.“Data drives all that we do.” That is the motto emblazoned on the website of Cambridge Analytica, the consulting firm that was employed by the Trump campaign to influence voters and that is now under scrutiny for its unauthorized harvesting of data from at least 50 million social media users.The heart of Cambridge Analytica’s power is an enormous information warehouse — as many as 5,000 data points on each of more than 230 million Americans, according to recent reporting, a fact the company proudly confirms on its website. Its promise of elections driven by data ultimately implies a vision of government steered not by people but by algorithms, and by an expanding data-mining culture operating without restrictions.That such threats to democracy are now possible is due in part to the fact that our society lacks an information ethics adequate to its deepening dependence on data. Where politics is driven by data, we need a set of ethics to guide that data. But in our rush to deliver on the promises of Big Data, we have not sought one.An adequate ethics of data for today would include not only regulatory policy and statutory law governing matters like personal data privacy and implicit bias in algorithms. It would also establish cultural expectations, fortified by extensive education in high schools and colleges, requiring us to think about data technologies as we build them, not after they have already profiled, categorized and otherwise informationalized millions of people. Students who will later turn their talents to the great challenges of data science would also be trained to consider the ethical design and use of the technologies they will someday unleash.Clearly, we are not there. High schoolers today may aspire to be the next Mark Zuckerberg, but how many dream of designing ethical data technologies? Who would their role models even be? Executives at Facebook, Twitter and Amazon are among our celebrities today. But how many data ethics advocates can the typical social media user name?Our approach to the ethics of data is wholly reactive. Investigations are conducted and apologies are extracted only after damage has been done (and only in some instances). Mr. Zuckerberg seemed to take a positive step on Wednesday, when he vowed to take action to better protect Facebook’s user data. “We also made mistakes, there’s more to do, and we need to step up and do it,” he said in, unsurprisingly, a Facebook post.This is like lashing a rope around the cracking foundation of a building. What we need is for an ethics of data to be engineered right into the information skyscrapers being built today. We need data ethics by design. Any good building must comply with a complex array of codes, standards and detailed studies of patterns of use by its eventual inhabitants. But technical systems are today being built with a minimal concern for compliance and a total disregard for the downstream consequences of decades of identifiable data being collected on the babies being born into the most complicated information ecology that has ever existed.Mr. Zuckerberg and other Silicon Valley chiefs admitted in the wake of the election that their platforms needed fixing to help mitigate the bad actors who had exploited social media for political gain. It is not Mr. Zuckerberg’s fault that our society has given him a free pass (and a net worth of $67 billion) for inventing his platform first and asking only later what its social consequences might be. It is all of our faults. Thus, however successful Mr. Zuckerberg will be in making amends, he will assuredly do almost nothing to prevent the next wunderkind from coming along and building the next killer app that will unleash who knows what before anybody even has a chance to notice.The challenge of designing ethics into data technologies is formidable. This is in part because it requires overcoming a century-long ethos of data science: Develop first, question later. Datafication first, regulation afterward. A glimpse at the history of data science shows as much.The techniques that Cambridge Analytica uses to produce its psychometric profiles are the cutting edge of data-driven methodologies first devised 100 years ago. The science of personality research was born in 1917. That year, in the midst of America’s fevered entry into war, Robert Sessions Woodworth of Columbia University created the Personal Data Sheet, a questionnaire that promised to assess the personalities of Army recruits. The war ended before Woodworth’s psychological instrument was ready for deployment, but the Army had envisioned its use according to the precedent set by the intelligence tests it had been administering to new recruits under the direction of Robert Yerkes, a professor of psychology at Harvard at the time. The data these tests could produce would help decide who should go to the fronts, who was fit to lead and who should stay well behind the lines.The stakes of those wartime decisions were particularly stark, but the aftermath of those psychometric instruments is even more unsettling. As the century progressed, such tests — I.Q. tests, college placement exams, predictive behavioral assessments — would affect the lives of millions of Americans. Schoolchildren who may have once or twice acted out in such a way as to prompt a psychometric evaluation could find themselves labeled, setting them on an inescapable track through the education system.Researchers like Woodworth and Yerkes (or their Stanford colleague Lewis Terman, who formalized the first SAT) did not anticipate the deep consequences of their work; they were too busy pursuing the great intellectual challenges of their day, much like Mr. Zuckerberg in his pursuit of the next great social media platform. Or like Cambridge Analytica’s Christopher Wylie, the twentysomething data scientist who helped build psychometric profiles of two-thirds of all Americans by leveraging personal information gained through uninformed consent. All of these researchers were, quite understandably, obsessed with the great data science challenges of their generation. Their failure to consider the consequences of their pursuits, however, is not so much their fault as it is our collective failing.For the past 100 years we have been chasing visions of data with a singular passion. Many of the best minds of each new generation have devoted themselves to delivering on the inspired data science promises of their day: intelligence testing, building the computer, cracking the genetic code, creating the internet, and now this. We have in the course of a single century built an entire society, economy and culture that runs on information. Yet we have hardly begun to engineer data ethics appropriate for our extraordinary information carnival. If we do not do so soon, data will drive democracy, and we may well lose our chance to do anything about it.Colin Koopman is an associate professor of philosophy and director of new media and culture at the University of Oregon.

As Facebook grapples with a backlash over its role in spreading disinformation, an internal dispute over how to handle the threat and the public outcry is resulting in the departure of a senior executive.The impending exit of that executive — Alex Stamos, Facebook’s chief information security officer — reflects heightened leadership tension at the top of the social network. Much of the internal disagreement is rooted in how much Facebook should publicly share about how nation states misused the platform and debate over organizational changes in the run-up to the 2018 midterm elections, according to current and former employees briefed on the matter.Mr. Stamos, who plans to leave Facebook by August, had advocated more disclosure around Russian interference of the platform and some restructuring to better address the issues, but was met with resistance by colleagues, said the current and former employees. In December, Mr. Stamos’s day-to-day responsibilities were reassigned to others, they said.Mr. Stamos said he would leave Facebook but was persuaded to stay through August to oversee the transition of his responsibilities and because executives thought his departure would look bad, the people said. He has been overseeing the transfer of his security team to Facebook’s product and infrastructure divisions. His group, which once had 120 people, now has three, the current and former employees said.

Mr. Stamos would be the first high-ranking employee to leave Facebook since controversy over disinformation on its site. Company leaders — including Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, and Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer — have struggled to address a growing set of problems, including Russian interference on the platform, the rise of false news and the disclosure over the weekend that 50 million of its user profiles had been harvested by Cambridge Analytica, a voter-profiling company.■ More about how Cambridge Analytica collected Facebook data.

        The developments have taken a toll internally, said the seven people briefed on the matter, who asked not to be identified because the proceedings were confidential. Some of the company’s executives are weighing their own legacies and reputations as Facebook’s image has taken a beating. Several believe the company would have been better off saying little about Russian interference and note that other companies, such as Twitter, which have stayed relatively quiet on the issue, have not had to deal with as much criticism.One central tension at Facebook has been that of the legal and policy teams versus the security team. The security team generally pushed for more disclosure about how nation states had misused the site, but the legal and policy teams have prioritized business imperatives, said the people briefed on the matter.“The people whose job is to protect the user always are fighting an uphill battle against the people whose job is to make money for the company,” said Sandy Parakilas, who worked at Facebook enforcing privacy and other rules until 2012 and now advises a nonprofit organization called the Center for Humane Technology, which is looking at the effect of technology on people.Mr. Stamos said in statement on Monday, “These are really challenging issues, and I’ve had some disagreements with all of my colleagues, including other executives.” On Twitter, he said he was “still fully engaged with my work at Facebook” and acknowledged that his role has changed, without addressing his future plans.
        
            Despite the rumors, I'm still fully engaged with my work at Facebook. It's true that my role did change. I'm currently spending more time exploring emerging security risks and working on election security.         —

    Facebook did not have a comment on the broader issues around Mr. Stamos’s departure.Mr. Stamos joined Facebook from Yahoo in June 2015. He and other Facebook executives, such as Ms. Sandberg, disagreed early on over how proactive the social network should be in policing its own platform, said the people briefed on the matter. In his statement, Mr. Stamos said his relationship with Ms. Sandberg was “productive.”Mr. Stamos first put together a group of engineers to scour Facebook for Russian activity in June 2016, the month the Democratic National Committee announced it had been attacked by Russian hackers, the current and former employees said.By November 2016, the team had uncovered evidence that Russian operatives had aggressively pushed DNC leaks and propaganda on Facebook. That same month, Mr. Zuckerberg publicly dismissed the notion that fake news influenced the 2016 election, calling it a “pretty crazy idea.”

In the ensuing months, Facebook’s security team found more Russian disinformation and propaganda on its site, according to the current and former employees. By the spring of 2017, deciding how much Russian interference to disclose publicly became a major source of contention within the company.

Mr. Stamos pushed to disclose as much as possible, while others including Elliot Schrage, Facebook’s vice president of communications and policy, recommended not naming Russia without more ironclad evidence, said the current and former employees.A detailed memorandum Mr. Stamos wrote in early 2017 describing Russian interference was scrubbed for mentions of Russia and winnowed into a blog post last April that outlined, in hypothetical terms, how Facebook could be manipulated by a foreign adversary, they said. Russia was only referenced in a vague footnote. That footnote acknowledged that Facebook’s findings did not contradict a declassified January 2017 report in which the director of national intelligence concluded Russia had sought to undermine United States election, and Hillary Clinton in particular.Mr. Stamos said in his statement that “we decided that the responsible thing to do would be to make clear that our findings were consistent with those released by the U.S. intelligence community, which clearly connected the activity in their report to Russian state-sponsored actors.”But Facebook’s decision to omit Russia backfired. Weeks later, a Time magazine article revealed that Russia had created fake accounts and purchased fake ads to spread propaganda on the platform, allegations that Facebook initially denied.By last September, after Mr. Stamos’s investigation had revealed further Russian interference, Facebook was forced to reverse course. That month, the company disclosed that beginning in June 2015, Russians had paid Facebook $100,000 to run roughly 3,000 divisive ads to show the American electorate.In response, lawmakers like Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the intelligence committee, said that although Facebook’s revelation was a good first step, “I’m disappointed it’s taken 10 months of raising this issue before they’ve become much more transparent.”And the revelation also prompted more attention into how Russians had manipulated the social network. Last October and November, Facebook was grilled in front of lawmakers on Capitol Hill for Russian meddling on its platform, along with executives from Twitter and YouTube.

The public reaction caused some at Facebook to recoil at revealing more, said the current and former employees. Since the 2016 election, Facebook has paid unusual attention to the reputations of Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg, conducting polls to track how they are viewed by the public, said Tavis McGinn, who was recruited to the company last April and headed the executive reputation efforts through September 2017.Mr. McGinn, who now heads Honest Data, which has done polling about Facebook’s reputation in different countries, said Facebook is “caught in a Catch-22.”“Facebook cares so much about its image that the executives don’t want to come out and tell the whole truth when things go wrong,” he said. “But if they don’t, it damages their image.”Mr. McGinn said he left Facebook after becoming disillusioned with the company’s conduct.By December 2017, Mr. Stamos, who reports to Facebook’s general counsel, proposed that he report directly to higher-ups. Facebook executives rejected that proposal and instead reassigned Mr. Stamos’s team, splitting the security team between its product team, overseen by Guy Rosen, and infrastructure team, overseen by Pedro Canahuati, according to current and former employees.Apart from managing a small team of engineers in San Francisco, Mr. Stamos has largely been left as Facebook’s security communicator. Last month, he appeared as Facebook’s representative at the Munich Security Conference.Over the weekend, after news broke that Cambridge Analytica had harvested data on as many as 50 million Facebook users, Facebook’s communications team encouraged Mr. Stamos to tweet in defense of the company, but only after it asked to approve Mr. Stamos’s tweets, according to two people briefed on the incident.

After the tweets set off a furious response, Mr. Stamos deleted them.Roger B. McNamee, an early investor in Facebook who said he considered himself a mentor to Mr. Zuckerberg, said the company was failing to face the fundamental problems posed by the Russian meddling and other manipulation of content.“I told them, ‘Your business is based on trust, and you’re losing trust,’” said Mr. McNamee, a founder of the Center for Humane Technology. “They were treating it as a P.R. problem, when it’s a business problem. I couldn’t believe these guys I once knew so well had gotten so far off track.”■ Cambridge Analytica executives were caught on video offering to entrap clients’ opponents.

Sign up here.You know those weeks when crazy things happen at work, your entire schedule goes haywire and the concept of a good night’s sleep starts to resemble a hazy and futile dream, like full employment or healthy pizza?Well, folks, this was one of those weeks. On Friday night, when Facebook published a blog post saying that it had suspended Cambridge Analytica for misappropriating user data — a post that was intended to pre-empt articles by The New York Times and The Observer of London about that very subject, which were published the next day — it became clear that this was a new kind of Facebook privacy scandal. It has already led to congressional inquiries and user revolts, thrusting the company into the kind of chaos it had not seen in its 14-year history.On Wednesday, after a five-day silence and lots of speculation about his whereabouts, Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, finally re-emerged with a Facebook post and an interview with my colleague Sheera Frenkel and me, among others. You can read the transcript of our interview here, and read our article about Facebook’s horrible week here.

We had only about 30 minutes on the phone with Mr. Zuckerberg, but we managed to get him to address several important topics: the Cambridge Analytica mess, Facebook’s lax data policies, its plans to clamp down on third-party developer access and notify users whose data was misused, election interference (including previously unreported Macedonian attempts to interfere in last year’s Alabama special election) and Facebook’s broader responsibility as a global power.

        But Mr. Zuckerberg’s responses also raised more questions.Here, for example, is how he answered a question about Facebook’s business model, which is based on selling advertisers and developers the ability to target Facebook users based on their personal data.Roose: Is the basic economic model of Facebook, in which users provide data that Facebook uses to help advertisers and developers to better target potential customers and users — do you feel like that works, given what we now know about the risks?
Zuckerberg: Yeah, so this is a really important question. The thing about the ad model that is really important that aligns with our mission is that — our mission is to build a community for everyone in the world and to bring the world closer together. And a really important part of that is making a service that people can afford. A lot of the people, once you get past the first billion people, can’t afford to pay a lot. Therefore, having it be free and have a business model that is ad-supported ends up being really important and aligned.
Now, over time, might there be ways for people who can afford it to pay a different way? That’s certainly something we’ve thought about over time. But I don’t think the ad model is going to go away, because I think fundamentally, it’s important to have a service like this that everyone in the world can use, and the only way to do that is to have it be very cheap or free.Narrowly, it may be true that being free and ad supported helps Facebook achieve its goals of connecting billions of people to its services. Facebook has developed a number of ways to make itself cheaper and easier to access — including, in some countries, effectively subsidizing use through its Free Basics program, which allows people to use Facebook without its counting toward their data plans.

But it’s not clear this approach has served society well. Especially in countries like Myanmar, where Facebook was recently blamed by United Nations investigators for fueling ethnic violence against the Rohingya, it’s possible that having a slightly higher barrier to entry would be a net good, even if it cost Facebook some users in the short term. (And it’s not even clear that it would. People already pay for their cellphones and data plans all over the world, and might be willing to part with a small fee to keep using their favorite social network.)Switching to a subscription model wouldn’t fix all of Facebook’s problems overnight. There would still be foreign actors trying to interfere in elections, false news and divisive content intending to sway public opinion, and innumerable other issues. But moving away from an ad-supported model would make the network harder to exploit. (Bot networks are less effective on subscription platforms, for example.) And it would lessen the company’s incentive to sell out its users’ privacy to advertisers.Facebook has already shown a willingness to try new models. WhatsApp, for example, makes money by charging businesses for an enterprise product that lets them message their customers. And this week, in an announcement immediately buried by an avalanche of other news about the company, Facebook said it was experimenting with a subscription model that would allow popular creators to charge $5 per month for access to their posts.What if all of Facebook cost $5 per month to use, and certain types of divisive and exploitable ad categories and behaviors were removed from the network entirely? Would users revolt en masse, and decide to colonize some other free social media app? Would Facebook collapse without a pipeline of advertising dollars?Maybe. But being smaller might not be a bad thing. If we’ve learned anything from this year’s troubles, it’s this: Facebook’s platform problems multiply as it gets bigger and more complex, but its ability to deal with those problems stays fairly constant. Zuckerberg might be dedicated to fixing Facebook’s problems, but unless he addresses its biggest problem of all — its enormous scale, paired with a business model that requires the company to monetize its users’ private data to the greatest extent possible — there’s only so much he can do.Kevin Roose writes a column called The Shift and is a writer-at-large for The New York Times Magazine.

            But in the past week, as Facebook plunged into a crisis over how Cambridge Analytica, a political consulting firm that provided voter-targeting services to the Trump campaign, improperly obtained data on 50 million Facebook users, Mark Zuckerberg, the social network’s chief executive, said, well, nothing.

Neither Mr. Zuckerberg nor Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook’s chief operating officer, has made any public appearances this week. Mr. Zuckerberg’s last public post on Facebook was a March 2 photo of himself and his wife, Priscilla Chan, baking hamantaschen cookies to celebrate the Jewish holiday of Purim; Ms. Sandberg’s most recent post was a four-day-old photo from her child’s debate competition.

        [Updated: Mark Zuckerberg Breaks His Silence, Vows Action to Bolster Data Privacy]Facebook employees have described a tense atmosphere in which some joked about selling their stock in the company before it took another dip. The company has lost about $50 billion in market value in the last couple of days. Over the past few months, as criticism of the company’s role in the 2016 election has escalated, some employees have sought to transfer to other divisions of the company, such as WhatsApp and Instagram, calling their work on Facebook’s main product “demoralizing.”On Monday, The New York Times reported that Alex Stamos, the company’s chief security officer, was slated to leave the company in August after disagreements with other top executives over the handling of Russia’s exploitation of Facebook’s platform during the 2016 election season. On Tuesday, Brian Acton, a co-founder of WhatsApp, which was acquired by Facebook in 2014 for $19 billion, posted a tweet that read, “It is time. #deletefacebook.” Mr. Acton did not return a request for comment.

Two people familiar with the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the discussions were confidential, said that Mr. Zuckerberg planned to address the Cambridge Analytica situation and the larger data privacy issues with a public statement on Wednesday. The statement will be aimed at rebuilding trust with users, one of the people said. In the past week, one of the people said, Mr. Zuckerberg has spent significant time hunkered down with a small group of engineers to discuss how to make Facebook’s users more secure, with more control of their data.Kate Losse, an early Facebook employee and Mr. Zuckerberg’s former speechwriter, said that the Cambridge Analytica controversy was different from previous Facebook privacy scandals, in that it was about an issue at the core of the company’s business model that will not be easily remedied: the disclosure of Facebook data to outside sources through its third-party developer platform.“My guess is that what is giving Zuckerberg pause at this point is the question of how to acknowledge and explain this state of affairs while at the same time mitigating the concerns that will come from people finally understanding how this all worked,” she said.

Mr. Zuckerberg is no stranger to speaking out during times of company crisis. In 2006, users rebelled after Facebook introduced the first version of its news feed, which showed users for the first time what their friends were doing on the social network. As groups formed to protest what they felt was an incursion on their privacy, Mr. Zuckerberg posted a peacemaking note on his Facebook page.“Calm down. Breathe. We hear you,” he wrote.

WASHINGTON — Facebook on Sunday faced a backlash about how it protects user data, as American and British lawmakers demanded that it explain how a political data firm with links to President Trump’s 2016 campaign was able to harvest private information from more than 50 million Facebook profiles without the social network’s alerting users.Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, a Democratic member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, went so far as to press for Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, to appear before the panel to explain what the social network knew about the misuse of its data “to target political advertising and manipulate voters.”The calls for greater scrutiny followed reports on Saturday in The New York Times and The Observer of London that Cambridge Analytica, a political data firm founded by Stephen K. Bannon and Robert Mercer, the wealthy Republican donor, had used the Facebook data to develop methods that it claimed could identify the personalities of individual American voters and influence their behavior. The firm’s so-called psychographic modeling underpinned its work for the Trump campaign in 2016, though many have questioned the effectiveness of its techniques.But Facebook did not inform users whose data had been harvested. The lack of disclosure could violate laws in Britain and in many American states.

Damian Collins, a Conservative lawmaker in Britain who is leading a parliamentary inquiry into fake news and Russian meddling in the country’s referendum to leave the European Union, said this weekend that he, too, would call on Mr. Zuckerberg or another top executive to testify. The social network sent executives who handle policy matters to answer questions at an earlier hearing in February.        Continue reading the main story

        “It is not acceptable that they have previously sent witnesses who seek to avoid answering difficult questions by claiming not to know the answers,” Mr. Collins said in a statement. “This also creates a false reassurance that Facebook’s stated policies are always robust and effectively policed.”The fallout from the reports added to questions Facebook was already confronting over the use of its platform by those seeking to spread Russian propaganda and fake news. The social media giant has grappled with the criticism over the issue for much of the past year, and struggled to keep public opinion on its side.Over the weekend, Facebook was on the defensive. Top executives took to Twitter to argue that the company’s protections had not been breached, and that Facebook was thus not at fault.“This was unequivocally not a data breach,” tweeted Andrew Bosworth, a Facebook executive. “No systems were infiltrated, no passwords or information were stolen or hacked.”The data was obtained in 2014, when Cambridge Analytica, through an outside researcher, paid users small sums to take a personality quiz and download an app, which would scrape some private information from their profiles and from those of their friends — activity that Facebook permitted at the time. The approach was based on a technique pioneered at Cambridge University by data scientists who claimed it could reveal more about a person than even their parents or romantic partners knew.The researcher hired by Cambridge Analytica, Alexandr Kogan, told Facebook and his app’s users that he was collecting information for academic purposes, not for a political data firm owned by a wealthy conservative. Facebook did nothing to verify how the information was being used.Mr. Bosworth argued on Twitter that a violation had been committed only by Cambridge Analytica and Mr. Kogan, whose app “did not follow the data agreements.”

Facebook’s chief security officer, Alex Stamos, issued a similar defense in a series of tweets that have since been deleted.“The recent Cambridge Analytica stories by the NY Times and The Guardian are important and powerful, but it is incorrect to call this a ‘breach’ under any reasonable definition of the term,” Mr. Stamos tweeted.The explanation did little, however, to stem the tide of anger as independent researchers pointed out that many others could have similarly misused Facebook data.“Facebook’s platform must protect us from predatory behavior,” wrote a Twitter user named Evan Baily, “or we can’t and shouldn’t trust the platform.”Photo

            Jonathan Albright, research director at the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University, wrote that the lack oversight and transparency into what sort of data Facebook collected on its users meant that the company’s platform could continue to be exploited.“Unethical people will always do bad things when we make it easy for them and there are few — if any — lasting repercussions,” Mr. Albright said.Paul Grewal, a vice president and deputy general counsel at Facebook, said in a statement that the company was looking into whether the data in question still existed. “That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information,” he said.

This month, The Times viewed a set of raw data from the profiles Cambridge Analytica obtained. And a former employee of the data firm described having recently seen hundreds of gigabytes of unencrypted data files on Cambridge servers.There were also questions from technology experts and others about Facebook’s reaction to the news reports by The Times and The Observer, especially its decision to suspend the account of Christopher Wylie, a data expert who oversaw Cambridge Analytica’s data harvesting — but also spoke out about it to the two news organizations.

On Friday, Facebook threatened to sue The Observer to stop it from publishing, the newspaper’s outgoing editor, John Mulholland, said on Twitter.
        
            It's a shame Facebook as a whole didn't do a better job weighing. Last night they threatened to sue the Observer/Guardian to stop this story coming out. Maybe you can explain that one. https://t.co/RwlMeO6bQ7         —

    Then, late Friday evening, Facebook posted a statement that expressed alarm at the data leak. The company promised to take action and announced that it was suspending the accounts of Cambridge Analytica, Mr. Kogan and Mr. Wylie.By then, Facebook had learned that Mr. Wylie, who left Cambridge Analytica in 2014, was a named source for the news reports.In a statement on Sunday, Mr. Wylie described himself as “a curious and naïve 23-year-old,” when he first went to work for Cambridge Analytica.“I feel a sense of regret every day when I see where they have helped take our world,” he added. “I need to make amends, and that’s why I’m coming forward.”

    His lawyer, Tamsin Allen, said that last week Mr. Wylie offered to help Facebook recover the missing data.Now, though, Facebook said on Sunday, Mr. Wylie is refusing to cooperate with the company until the suspension is lifted — a move the social network is not willing to make because of his role in the data harvesting.In both Britain and the United States, lawmakers said that in the light of the new reports, they wanted fresh answers from both Facebook and Cambridge Analytica about how the data was obtained and what was done with it.

Mr. Collins, the British lawmaker, said he planned to call Alexander Nix, the chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, to return to Parliament and answer questions about testimony last month in which he claimed that the company never obtained or used Facebook data.“It seems clear that he has deliberately misled the committee and Parliament,” Mr. Collins said.In the United States, the attorney general of Massachusetts, Maura Healey, announced on Saturday that her office was opening an investigation. “Massachusetts residents deserve answers immediately from Facebook and Cambridge Analytica,” she said in a Twitter post that linked to the Times article.

Also on Saturday, the two top Congressional Democrats leading inquiries into Russian interference in the 2016 election — Senator Mark Warner of Virginia and Representative Adam Schiff of California — called for investigations of the Facebook data leak.“This raises serious questions about the level of detail that Cambridge Analytica knew about users,” said Mr. Schiff, who is the ranking Democrat on the House intelligence committee.
    
         Correction: March 18, 2018  An earlier version of this article misidentified the role of Senator Amy Klobuchar on the Senate Judiciary Committee. She is a Democratic member of the committee, not the ranking Democratic member. (The ranking Democrat is Senator Dianne Feinstein.)

In 2007, a young Mark Zuckerberg stood on a stage in San Francisco and announced that Facebook was throwing open its doors.No longer, he said, would Facebook be a closed-off software product like every other social network. Instead, it would become an open platform and invite outside developers to build apps and programs on top of it.“We want to make Facebook into something of an operating system,” Mr. Zuckerberg told a reporter.At the time, the announcement drew little notice outside the programming world. Developers quickly went to work making fun and quirky apps that plugged into Facebook — early hits included “Rendezbook,” a kind of proto-Tinder that allowed users to match with each other for “random flings,” and CampusRank, which allowed college students to nominate their peers for yearbook-type awards.

Later, popular games like FarmVille arrived, and apps like Tinder and Spotify began allowing their users to log in using their Facebook credentials. In some ways, it was a fair trade. Facebook got to weave itself more deeply into users’ internet habits, and the outside app developers got access to a big audience and valuable data about their users. In all, millions of apps have been created with Facebook’s open platform tools.        Continue reading the main story

        Through it all, Facebook’s users were mostly unfazed. Sure, these apps collected data about their lives. But they seemed convenient and harmless, and, really, what could go wrong?Today, more than a decade later, the consequences of Facebook’s laissez-faire approach are becoming clear. Over the weekend, The New York Times reported that Cambridge Analytica, a British consulting firm, improperly acquired the private data of about roughly 50 million Facebook users, and used it to target voters on behalf of the Trump campaign during the 2016 presidential election.What happened with Cambridge Analytica wasn’t technically a data breach, since this trove of personal information wasn’t stolen from Facebook’s servers. Rather, it was given away freely to the maker of a Facebook personality quiz app called “thisisyourdigitallife.”That app, which was developed by a University of Cambridge professor, collected data about the 270,000 people who installed it, along with data about their Facebook friends, totaling 50 million people in all. The professor, Aleksandr Kogan, then gave the data he had harvested to Cambridge Analytica.Technically, only this last step violated Facebook’s rules, which prohibit selling or giving away data collected by a third-party app. The rest was business as usual. Third-party apps collect vast amounts of detailed personal information about Facebook users every day, including their ages, location, pages they’ve liked and groups they belong to. Users can opt out of sharing specific pieces of information, but it’s unclear how many do.

This kind of broad data collection is not only allowed but encouraged by Facebook, which wants to keep developers happily building on top of its platform. Permissiveness is a feature, as they say, not a bug.But in the wake of incidents like the data leak to Cambridge Analytica, some are questioning the costs of such loose policies on an influential platform with 2.2 billion registered users.

“It seems insane that you can make haphazard decisions about so many people’s data,” said Can Duruk, a technology consultant and software engineer. Facebook, he said, was “extremely lax with what kind of data they allowed people to get.”In a Facebook post on Monday, Andrew Bosworth, a Facebook vice president, admitted that that thinking may have been a mistake.“We thought that every app could be social,” Mr. Bosworth wrote. “Your calendar should have your events and your friends birthdays, your maps should know where your friends live, your address book should show their pictures. It was a reasonable vision but it didn’t materialize the way we had hoped.”An early clue about the potential for misuse of Facebook’s third-party developer tools came in 2010 when my colleague Emily Steel, then at The Wall Street Journal, reported that an online tracking company, RapLeaf, was collecting and reselling data it had gathered from third-party Facebook apps to marketing firms and political consultants. In response, Facebook cut off RapLeaf’s data access and said it would “dramatically limit” the misuse of its users’ personal information by outside parties.But preventing data-hungry developers from exploiting Facebook’s treasure trove of personal information remained challenging. In 2015, Facebook removed the ability of third-party developers to collect detailed information about the friends of users who had installed an app, citing privacy concerns. (Cambridge Analytica’s data trove, which included this type of information, was gathered in 2014, before the change.) Facebook has also taken away tools used by developers to create games and quizzes that barraged users with annoying notifications.But the core functions of Facebook’s open platform tool are still intact. There are still many third-party apps like “thisisyourdigitallife” out there, vacuuming up intimate data about Facebook users. That data doesn’t disappear, and Facebook has no real recourse to stop it from falling into the wrong hands.Not all open data access is used irresponsibly. Researchers and nongovernmental organizations have used Facebook’s third-party development tools to respond to natural disasters. And many of the functions that internet users depend on — for example, the ability to import their digital address books into a new messaging app — are possible thanks only to the tools that allow for third-party development known as application programming interfaces, or A.P.I.s.“Everything we depend on uses A.P.I.s,” said Kin Lane, a software engineer who maintains a website called API Evangelist. “They’re in your home, in your business, in your car. It’s how these platforms innovate and do cool, interesting things.”In Facebook’s case, permissive data policies were also good for business. Third-party developers built millions of apps on top of Facebook’s platform, giving Facebook users more reasons to spend time on the site and generating more ad revenue for the company. Restricting access to data would limit Facebook’s usefulness to developers and could drive them to build on a rival platform instead, making those products better.

In this context, it’s even less surprising that Dr. Kogan and Cambridge Analytica were able to use a silly personality quiz to collect information about millions of Americans. After all, why else would the quiz be there?

Sign up here.We’ve been here beforeAn unorthodox action by President Trump unsettles investors, but after a freakout, their optimism returns and the stock market moves higher.But will investors shrug off President Trump’s tariffs on China?The stock market plunged Thursday after Mr. Trump announced the measures against China. Since mid-February, when the Trump administration laid out its case for steel and aluminum tariffs, the S.&P. 500 is down 3.2 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average is off nearly 5 percent.

Until now, investors might have thought they could take Mr. Trump’s trade pronouncements in stride. After all, many countries have won a reprieve from the steel and aluminum tariffs. And as Edward Alden of the Council on Foreign Relations wrote Thursday of the anti-China measures, “The administration is delaying the action to solicit comments from affected U.S. companies, and it is quite possible the final tariffs will fall short of the threats.”        Continue reading the main story

        Just as the Trump administration has stepped back from quickly imposing the steel and aluminum tariffs, it may soften its stance if China suggests that its open to negotiations. The world could relax.But China may not budge. As our colleague Steven Lee Myers reports, President Xi Jinping has so far managed to navigate Mr. Trump’s rhetoric while maintaining a strong nationalist image at home. Yet Mr. Trump’s tariff announcement, along with moves perceived by the Chinese as humiliating, may prompt China to retaliate with force.Investors would then scramble to quantify the economic repercussions. They might not be terrible.Some American companies, like computer chip makers, get substantial revenue from China. But on average, companies in the S.&P. 500 index derive a small share of their sales from the country.And some investors may take a long view, believing that U.S. companies have long been treated unfairly in China. A trade fight that eventually relaxes some of those disadvantageous conditions could bolster the long-term prospects of those firms. And if the U.S. is able to recruit other countries to its cause, China may relent.Still, much could go wrong. A true test of investor sentiment will come if China fights back. Markets could fall further, creating a financial chain reaction that dampens the wider economy. A lot would depend on how Mr. Trump responds to Chinese actions. Would he up the ante?“It’s genuinely hard to predict how this will turn out,” said Scott Kennedy, an expert in Chinese trade at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, “whether one side will back down or whether it will spiral into a trade war.”— Peter EavisPhoto

            Trump on tariffs: “If they charge us, we charge them.”President Trump said he would impose about $60 billion worth of annual tariffs on Chinese imports as the White House moved to punish China for what it says is a pattern of co-opting American technology and trade secrets and robbing companies of jobs and billions of dollars in revenue.The tariffs will target 1,300 lines of Chinese goods — everything from shoes and clothing to electronics — the NYT reports administration officials said.Mr. Trump, the officials added, will also direct the Treasury Department to impose restrictions on Chinese investment in American technology companies, a practice that they said the Chinese government uses to develop its own “national champions” in cutting-edge industries like A.I. and autonomous vehicles.“The end objective of this is to get China to modify its unfair trade practices,” Everett Eissenstat, the deputy director of the National Economic Council, told reporters.Peter Navarro, the director of the White House National Trade Council and an architect of the measures, cast the tariffs as part of a seminal shift in how the U.S. views China. Rather than trying to draw it into the rules-based international economic order — a policy that dates back to Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger — the U.S. now regards China as a strategic competitor, bent on eroding American security and prosperity.— Mark Landler and Jim TankersleyPhoto

            The stock market is proving Gary Cohn rightBefore he said he was leaving his White House position earlier this month, Mr. Cohn reportedly warned that protectionist trade policies could jeopardize the stock rally that has taken place since Donald Trump became president. After Mr. Trump announced tariffs on steel and aluminum, the stock market slid, but soon recovered those losses, reassuring the president that his decision to introduce tariffs was right.

On Thursday, the Trump administration announced trade restrictions against China. The news appeared to weigh on markets. So, how have stocks done since important dates in the trade skirmish?One important milestone was the Commerce Department’s announcement last month that suggested the Trump administration was serious about introducing steel and aluminum tariffs. The S.&P. 500 index is down 2.3 percent since the day before that announcement. Mr. Trump actually announced plans for those tariffs on March 1. The S.&P. 500 is down 1.7 percent since Feb. 28.The Dow Jones industrial average has done a lot worse, however. It is down 3.7 percent since the Commerce Department’s announcement, and 3.1 percent since Mr. Trump announced his intentions. The decline encapsulated how trade tension might hurt specific businesses, in particular, Boeing’s.— Peter EavisPhoto

            Blame BoeingMuch of the Dow’s underperformance can be traced to the aircraft maker’s stock.The Trump administration’s trade policies have hit Boeing, the most-heavily weighted stock in the Dow, particularly hard.Aluminum makes up about 80 percent of the weight of most commercial aircrafts, according to Brooke Sutherland and David Fickling of Gadfly. That means tariffs on imported aluminum would likely raise Boeing’s costs more than its competitors. Boeing also views China, the main target of the Trump administration’s protectionist trade policies, as an important growth market. The country is set to overtake the U.S. as the biggest aviation market by 2022, Ms. Sutherland and Mr. Fickling write.China could target Boeing if the country decides to retaliate against the U.S.Boeing is down 3.6 percent today, shaving more than 80 points off the blue-chip index. Since the Commerce Department released its report calling for tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, the stock is down 8.7 percent, worth more than 200 points off the Dow.Boeing drove the Dow higher for much of Mr. Trump’s presidency, more than doubling during his first 12 months in office.Boeing’s climb has had an outsized impact on the Dow. The index is price-weighted, meaning that the higher priced stocks have a bigger pull on the index.

MoneyBeat’s Ben Eisen noted that at the end of January, the stock accounted for 9.4 percent of Dow, up from 6 percent a year earlier. By comparison, Boeing makes up just 0.8 percent of the market capitalization weighted S.&P. 500.Photo

            It’s not just Boeing that is falling on trade tensionsChinese tech stocks are also tumbling.Shares of Alibaba are off 4.2 percent, Tencent 5 percent and Baidu 4.3 percent in the wake of the Trump administration’s plan to impose about $60 billion worth of annual tariffs on Chinese imports.That is much worse than their American counterparts. Amazon, Facebook and Google’s parent Alphabet are down between 1.2 percent and 2.2 percent by comparison.Shares of Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent — collectively known as BAT — have soared over the past year, pushing their combined market value above $1 trillion.As these companies have grown, so have their ambitions. All three have moved to expand beyond their core business and home market and have aggressively invested in Americantech start-ups to help them do so.China’s largest internet companies — the BAT plus the e-commerce company JD.com — have invested $5.6 billion in 48 tech deals in the United States over the past two years, according to CBI Insights data via CNBC.Such investments have raised concerns in the United States. The Trump administration officials said the Chinese government uses these investments to develop its own “national champions” in cutting-edge industries like A.I. and autonomous vehicles. As part of the China tariffs, the Trump administration plans to place restrictions on Chinese investment in American technology companies.The Bank of England stays firm amid other banks’ rate hikesShrugging off hikes by the Federal Reserve and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority this week, the Bank of England maintained its key interest rate at 0.5 percent today.

Two members of the central bank’s monetary policy committee called for an immediate rate increase, but the majority of the committee did not see the need for a hike at this time. Most economists expect the Bank of England to raise rates in May, when it releases its latest quarterly projection for inflation.

In the minutes from the committee’s latest meeting, the central bank said that there had been “few surprises” in recent economic data and its February projections for inflation appeared “broadly on track.” The bank said that the May inflation report would allow the committee to “undertake a fuller assessment of the underlying momentum in the economy, the degree of slack remaining and the extent of domestic inflationary pressures.”— Chad BrayPhoto

            Mark Zuckerberg has finally spokenAfter days of questions and criticism about his silence, the Facebook co-founder and C.E.O. posted a statement and gave a series of interviews. (Sheryl Sandberg offered a statement, too.)What he promised: to investigate apps that had access to large amounts of Facebook data, to restrict developers’ data access and to show users how to revoke app permissions.Highlights from his interviews:• To CNN: “I’m not sure we shouldn’t be regulated,” Zuckerberg said. “There are things like ad transparency regulation that I would love to see.” (He also made ad transparency promises to Wired.)• To the NYT, about Facebook’s business model: “I don’t think the ad model is going to go away, because I think fundamentally, it’s important to have a service like this that everyone in the world can use, and the only way to do that is to have it be very cheap or free.”• On why it took so long for him to respond, compared with other tech C.E.O.s: “I know that there was a lot of pressure to speak sooner, but my assessment was that it was more important that what we said was fully accurate.”• On #DeleteFacebook: “I don’t think we’ve seen a meaningful number of people act on that, but, you know, it’s not good.”

Why wasn’t the abuse disclosed then?Elsewhere in the Facebook orbit: A guide to deleting your account; idealistic reasons not to. Why former employees feel emboldened to criticize. And Cambridge Analytica is being accused of receiving a foreign leader’s private emails, perhaps from Israeli hackers. (It says it didn’t.)Photo

            The Fed raised rates again. The harder bit’s coming up.Adding a quarter of a percentage point to the benchmark interest rate, as expected, Jay Powell said, “There is no sense in the data that we’re on the cusp of an acceleration of inflation.”The Fed is now expected to raise rates three times this year, three times next year and twice in 2020. But there’s a bigger issue, as Neil Irwin of The Upshot points out:Those economic projections signal that Mr. Powell and his colleagues believe they can keep running the economy a little hot with mainly good results. But they seem to believe that a more aggressive shift toward higher interest rates will be needed to keep that benign future intact.Critics’ corner:  Justin Lahart of Heard on the Street writes about inflation, “The Fed’s view doesn’t jibe with the recent hopes and dreams of some investors.” And Tom Buerkle of Breakingviews writes, “The big questions are yet to come. Powell is smart to want maximum flexibility to address them.”Photo
    
            
    Video of the Uber self-driving fatality has emergedIt shows the vehicle in Tempe, Ariz. didn’t try to swerve from a woman walking her bike across the street, the WSJ says. And the human behind the wheel was looking down for about 5 seconds before it hit her.More from Greg Bensinger and Tim Higgins of the WSJ:“This video is damning for Uber,” said Todd Humphreys, an associate professor at the University of Texas at Austin whose research area is robot-perception systems. “This appears to have been a serious failure of the Uber perception system.”The stakes for Uber remain high, as Goldman Sachs analysts recently pointed out, since self-driving cars were part of its route to profits. And car insurers are watching closely, too.Elsewhere in Uber: The company withdrew an offer to make Assaf Ronen its new product head, after discovering he had left Amazon earlier than he said. Wall Street is fighting to get into Uber’s big debt deal.

When the Russia question came up during a hearing at the British Parliament last month, Alexander Nix did not hesitate.“We’ve never worked in Russia,” said Mr. Nix, head of a data consulting firm that advised the Trump campaign on targeting voters.“As far as I’m aware, we’ve never worked for a Russian company,” Mr. Nix added. “We’ve never worked with a Russian organization in Russia or any other country, and we don’t have any relationship with Russia or Russian individuals.”But Mr. Nix’s business did have some dealings with Russian interests, according to company documents and interviews.

Mr. Nix is a director of SCL Group, a British political and defense contractor, and chief executive of its American offshoot, Cambridge Analytica, which advised the Trump campaign. The firms’ employees, who often overlap, had contact in 2014 and 2015 with executives from Lukoil, the Russian oil giant.        Continue reading the main story

        Lukoil was interested in how data was used to target American voters, according to two former company insiders who said there were at least three meetings with Lukoil executives in London and Turkey. SCL and Lukoil denied that the talks were political in nature, and SCL also said there were no meetings in London.The contacts took place as Cambridge Analytica was building a roster of Republican clients in the United States — and harvesting the Facebook profiles of over 50 million users to develop tools to analyze voters’ behavior.Cambridge Analytica also included extensive questions about Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin, in surveys it was carrying out in American focus groups in 2014. It is not clear what — or which client — prompted the line of questioning, which asked for views on topics ranging from Mr. Putin’s popularity to Russian expansionism.On two promotional documents obtained by The New York Times, SCL said it did business in Russia. In both documents, the country is highlighted on world maps that specify the location of SCL clients, with one of the maps noting that the clients were for the firm’s elections division. In a statement, SCL said an employee had done “commercial work” about 25 years ago “for a private company in Russia.”Photo

            Cambridge Analytica has been a political flash point since its role in the Trump campaign attracted scrutiny after the election. While Mr. Nix’s firm turned over some records to the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence during its investigation of Russian interference, Democrats on the committee want a fuller review. “It is imperative to interview a broader range of individuals employed by or linked to Cambridge Analytica,” they said in a report this month.Asked about the Russian oil company, a spokesman for SCL said that in 2014 the firm’s commercial division “discussed helping Lukoil Turkey better engage with its loyalty-card customers at gas stations.” The spokesman said SCL was not ultimately hired.Arash Repac, chief executive of Lukoil Eurasia Petrol, offered a different explanation for the talks. He said that a meeting he attended with SCL in Turkey involved a promotional campaign with local soccer teams.

“We needed somebody to guide us with the customer data that we were collecting,” he wrote in response to a question from The Times. “Even though our campaign went ahead, we decided not to cooperate with SCL. No contracts were signed.”

But Christopher Wylie, who helped found Cambridge Analytica and develop the company’s voter-profiling technology, said Lukoil showed interest in how the company used data to tailor messaging to American voters.“I remember being super confused,” said Mr. Wylie, who took part in one of the Lukoil meetings.“I kept asking Alexander, ‘Can you explain to me what they want?’” he said, referring to Mr. Nix. “I don’t understand why Lukoil wants to know about political targeting in America.”“We’re sending them stuff about political targeting — they then come and ask more about political targeting,” Mr. Wylie said, adding that Lukoil “just didn’t seem to be interested” in how the techniques could be used commercially.Mr. Wylie, a former contractor, left SCL before the talks concluded and could not say what became of the relationship with the oil company. He had a falling out with SCL and tried to set up a rival business. SCL said he had violated a nondisclosure agreement and that his comments were an attempt to hurt the company.A second person familiar with the discussions backed up Mr. Wylie’s account, but spoke on the condition of anonymity because of a confidentiality agreement.Though Lukoil is not state-owned, it depends on Kremlin support, and its chief executive, Vagit Alekperov, has met with Mr. Putin on a number of occasions. Reuters reported last year that Lukoil and other companies received instructions from the state energy ministry on providing news stories favorable to Russian leadership.

        Silicon Valley Start-up Plenty raised $200 million from SoftBank’s $100 billion Vision Fund. Bowery Farming, whose vegetables are now sold in a few grocery stores in New York City, has collected money from the likes of Google’s venture arm and General Catalyst.Sensei is focused more on wellness. While the company ultimately plans to expand into an array of businesses, its initial focus is on hydroponic farming, using software and sensors to monitor growing conditions. (Its first farm is on Lanai, the Hawaiian island of which Mr. Ellison owns roughly 98 percent.)Sensei’s first batch of crops includes Black Trifele tomatoes and Komatsuna mustard greens, with its yardstick for production being nutrition per acre.“So far, the conversation in agriculture has been dominated by productivity: How much food can we grow in a square foot. But scale is just part of the equation,” Dr. Agus said in a statement. “To properly nourish the world, we need to consider how nutritious that food is. This is where Sensei is focused.”Its first customer is Hawaii, which imports the majority of its food. Sensei said that it can provide the state fresh food within 24 hours of harvesting, compared with over a week for imported vegetables.But the company is also eager to tout its tech bona fides. Its farm runs off solar power provided by Tesla panels. And it claims to use just 10 percent of the water used in traditional farming methods.“For so long, agriculture has been one of the least digitized industries,” Daniel Gruneberg, Sensei’s president, said in a statement. “Now, we can combine software, sensors and robotics to make giant leaps in sustainable farming and perhaps, more importantly, the quality of our food.”

Facebook’s slide drags down FANG stocks.Facebook’s stock had its worst day in about four years.Shares of the social media giant finished down about 7 percent after the NYT reported that a political data firm with ties to 2016 Trump campaign harvested private information from over 50 million user profiles.The news reports raised the specter of greater government scrutiny and potential regulatory action toward the technology sector. Already, government officials in the United States, Europe and elsewhere have been demanding tougher oversight of the world’s largest tech companies. That, in turn, could erode the industry’s profits and potentially force some companies to adjust their business models.Facebook’s stock is now down more than 12 percent from its all-time high hit at the start of February.“We think this episode is another indication of systemic problems at Facebook,” said Brian Wieser, an analyst at New York-based brokerage Pivotal Research Group.Facebook’s woes showed signs of spreading, too.The S.&P. 500 tech sector is the worst performing of the index’s 11 sectors.Shares of Google-parent Alphabet closed down about 3.2 percent. Amazon fell around 1.7 percent and Apple finished off 1.5 percent.In all, Monday’s slide wiped more than $80 billion off the market value of Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet. Facebook accounted for more than $35 billion of that total. In fact, the company is no longer among the five biggest companies in the S.&P. 500 by market capitalization.

Fund flows added fuel to the selloff. MoneyBeat’s Akane Otani reports that mutual funds and exchange-traded funds tracking U.S. technology stocks posted a record $2.6 billion in net inflows last week, according to data from fund tracker EPFR Global. That put year-to-date inflows at $47.5 billion.“The record-setting stream of money into stock funds has underlined how much the market has been driven by investor fervor for a handful of popular names, which some say makes stocks vulnerable to sudden reversals.”

            The latest test to Zuckerberg’s leadership.Is Mark Zuckerberg’s unusually powerful position at Facebook in part to blame for the latest backlash against the company?The giant social media company is under the spotlight because a political data firm apparently misused information about more than 50 million Facebook users. Facebook is still facing questions about Russia-linked accounts that had significant reach within the United States through the social network. In both cases, Facebook has struggled to show the public that it can get in front of its problems. Information about the Russia-linked accounts came out piecemeal, and Facebook knew as early as 2015 that the political data firm had violated its data policies.Mr. Zuckerberg at first downplayed concerns about Facebook’s role in the 2016 presidential election (something he later said he regretted). His recent communications contain more high-minded deliberation than hard discussion of the company’s problems and how to deal with them.These look like the reactions of a leader who thinks he is not going anywhere. Indeed, through his holding of special voting shares, Mr. Zuckerberg has an especially powerful position at Facebook that might shield him from the normal forces of accountability. C.E.O.s without that protection might do more to tackle a big problem because it more directly threatens their job security.Facebook, of course, has taken steps to address the abuse of its network. It has added hundreds of new employees to help police posts, and it has implemented artificial intelligence technology to spot material that falls afoul of the company’s guidelines. Such initiatives cost money. Mr. Zuckerberg earlier this year said that such initiatives would have a significant impact on Facebook’s profitability. Indeed, there’s a strong argument to make that Mr. Zuckerberg’s protected position will allow the company to press ahead with expensive investments in the face of any shareholder grumbling that may arise.In the near term, though, it’s hard to envision shareholders applying significant pressure on Facebook to be more responsive to the political and legal risks. They may believe Facebook’s extraordinary profitability – its operating profits are roughly equivalent to 40 percent of its revenue – will help the stock ride what they see as a passing storm.

If governments propose restrictions on using members’ data, Facebook’s business model would be tested. The company’s board, in theory, should press Mr. Zuckerberg for details on how he will deal with such shackles. But prominent board members like Marc L. Andreessen and Peter A. Thiel are skeptical of regulation. Facebook might be tempted to fight back.Lawmakers may hold the line, however, sensing that the public has real concerns about the company. And if Facebook’s responses look tardy and inadequate, the consequences could be harsh, as the fate of Wells Fargo  shows. Mr. Zuckerberg, in his uniquely dominant position, is the one person who can make sure this doesn’t happen.— Peter EavisLawmakers want answers on Facebook’s latest controversyLawmakers in the U.S. and Britain want Mark Zuckerberg to explain how Cambridge Analytica, the political data firm founded by Steve Bannon and Robert Mercer, harvested private information from over 50 million user profiles.“It’s clear these platforms can’t police themselves,” tweeted Senator Amy Klobuchar, a Democratic member of the Senate Judiciary Committee.What happened: The NYT and The Observer of London reported how Cambridge had collected data from an outside researcher to better target Facebook users. Christopher Wylie, who oversaw Cambridge’s data collection until 2014, told the NYT of his former company, “For them, this is a war, and it’s all fair.”Facebook argued that the incident wasn’t a data breach and that Cambridge had committed a violation. But former Federal Trade Commission officials told the WaPo that Facebook may have violated a privacy pact reached with the regulator. (The tech giant is reviewing whether one of its employees had been aware of the data leak.)More on Cambridge Analytica: Alexander Nix, the company’s chief, is facing scrutiny over business dealings with Russian interests. Mr. Wylie said that one Russian company, the oil giant Lukoil, appeared more interested in political message targeting than commercial uses. And Cambridge is reportedly trying to block the airing of a report by Channel 4, a British television channel, in which reporters went undercover at the firm.Critic’s cornerJeffrey Goldfarb of Breakingviews writes:“Facebook has abjectly failed to grasp the magnitude of its problems. It took Zuckerberg almost a year to apologize for his blithe 2016 comment that fake news posted across his website didn’t influence the U.S. election. In the meantime, there are mounting concerns over its online advertising power, handling of privacy matters and how much tax it pays in Europe. Ten years ago, Zuckerberg hired Sheryl Sandberg to help turn his startup into a serious corporation. It may be time for more adult supervision.”Photo

The Uber vehicle was in autonomous mode with a human safety driver at the wheel when it struck the woman, who was crossing the street outside of a crosswalk, the Tempe police said in a statement. The episode happened on Sunday around 10 p.m. The woman was not publicly identified.Uber said it had suspended testing of its self-driving cars in Tempe, Pittsburgh, San Francisco and Toronto.“Our hearts go out to the victim’s family. We are fully cooperating with local authorities in their investigation of this incident,” an Uber spokeswoman, Sarah Abboud, said in a statement.The fatal crash will most likely raise questions about regulations for self-driving cars. Testing of self-driving cars is already underway for vehicles that have a human driver ready to take over if something goes wrong, but states are starting to allow companies to test cars without a person in the driver’s seat. This month, California said that, in April, it would start allowing companies to test autonomous vehicles without anyone behind the wheel.— Daisuke WakabayashiPhoto

The start-up disclosed today that its partner, the IEX stock exchange, has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to let it apply its listing rules to the IEX.The filing — which will commence the public part of the S.E.C.’s review of the rule changes at IEX — advances the LTSE’s aim of enshrining what it believes are best practices in running companies into corporate charters.If the S.E.C approves the rules, it means that companies can go public using the LTSE principles, but also have their stocks trade on traditional exchanges like the N.Y.S.E. and the Nasdaq like any other listing. That means these companies can get the liquidity they need along with the corporate governance structure that they want, according to the LTSE’s founder, Eric Ries.It also formalizes a tie-up between LTSE and IEX, the exchange best known as the subject of Michael Lewis’s “Flash Boys.”

What the principles include• Letting so-called “citizens,” or investors who plan on sticking with companies for the long term, eventually accumulate more voting power over the years than “tourists” who plan on sticking around for a shorter time.• Blocking the use of certain kinds of compensation, including short-term bonuses paid to executives based on metrics like reaching a certain milestone for quarterly earnings.• Banning short-term guidance.• Having long-term investors register their holdings with the company. “The company will know effectively in real time who their long-term investors are,” Mr. Ries said.• Reporting requirements that include disclosing earnings per share net of buybacks, to provide a more accurate way of measuring how a company is doing without factoring in financial engineering.

The context• Mr. Ries has spoken of the need to reward long-term investors. “Most of the listing standards are designed to align managers and long-term shareholders,” he told me. “That frees up management to do what’s right.”• It comes as companies continue to bemoan short-term thinking in the stock markets that has C.E.O.s focused more on meeting a quarter’s targets than longer-term goals.• LTSE’s goal is to eventually become a stock exchange on which companies list their shares. But for now, it wants to be allowed to create a special kind of listing for IEX that lets companies go public under its principles.• LTSE also plans to promote itself as serving companies first and foremost and to make money more from listing fees and tools and services for its companies, rather than from trading offerings and data aimed at investors.The caveatIt’s a long road ahead. Not just for the rule-change process, but also in convincing start-ups to adopt these rules when they go public.“What we have promised our venture investors is not that this is going to instantly transform the market overnight,” Mr. Ries said.— Michael de la MercedPhoto

            It’s budget time, and Congress is preparing to spendFriday is the deadline for lawmakers to pass a budget, and they are considering a plan that would cost more than $1 trillion. Expect the deficit to widen to more than $800 billion, as well as a lot of pet projects.The proposal will probably garner Democratic support, but opposition could come from: a) fiscal conservatives, and b) President Trump (if it includes funding for a New York tunnel project).

            U.S. companies warn the White House on China tariffsForty-five trade groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, urged President Trump not to move forward with sweeping tariffs on Chinese goods.Here’s what Thomas Donohue, the C.E.O. of the chamber, said:“The livelihood of America’s consumers, businesses, farmers, and ranchers are at risk if the administration proceeds with this plan.”Elsewhere in trade: Mr. Trump is requesting authority to unilaterally raise tariffs, power that could undermine the World Trade Organization. And Latin American countries are forging closer commercial ties with each other, and with China.The political flyaround• President Trump attacked Robert Mueller’s investigation, using the special counsel’s name in his tweets for the first time and drawing rebukes from some Republican lawmakers.

            How realistic is Paul Jacobs’s quest to buy Qualcomm?The son of the company’s founder wants to take the chip maker private, à la Michael Dell and his eponymous computer empire. But it would be a herculean task. Consider:• Mr. Jacobs would probably have to pay more than the $117 billion that Broadcom offered.• He only owns about 1 percent of the company. Mr. Dell owned 14 percent of his.• He would have to bring in significant equity partners, since there is no way he could finance a takeover with debt alone. But it’s not clear where they might come from (SoftBank has shown little interest so far) and whether any foreign backers could pass a national security review.Critics’ corner:  Shira Ovide of Gadfly writes, “It’s unwise for the company’s former C.E.O. to chase after a dream that can’t possibly come true.” And John Foley of Breakingviews asserts that Qualcomm’s biggest issue is mending fences with Apple.Elsewhere in deals: Newell Brands revamped its board to settle a fight with Carl Icahn.

"90","Facebook Leaves Its Users’ Privacy Vulnerable","AdvertisementOpinionSupported byEditorialFacebook Leaves Its Users’ Privacy VulnerableImageCreditTim PeacockBy The Editorial BoardMarch 19, 2018Facebook is once again struggling with revelations that manipulative characters exploited the vulnerabilities of its platform during the 2016 election to put Donald Trump in the White House. The company said last week that it was suspending the accounts of Cambridge Analytica, a company that worked for the Trump campaign, and a professor, Aleksandr Kogan, who is said to have deceptively amassed information from more than 50 million people without their consent. That may sound like decisive action, but it came more than two years after Facebook learned of the problem.Starting in 2014, Mr. Kogan got the data, using a quiz app, under the guise of academic research. He handed the information to Cambridge Analytica, which used it to build profiles of voters’ personalities, according to reports in The New York Times and The Observer of London on Saturday.What is particularly disturbing about this case is that Facebook has not yet identified and alerted users whose profile information was vacuumed up by the app, most of whom had never used it but were friends with somebody else who had. Further, Facebook did not verify that Cambridge Analytica and Mr. Kogan deleted the data after the social media company told them to in 2015. The Times reported that Cambridge still had most or all of the data.Facebook’s response so far is reminiscent of its slow, defensive reaction to the spread of pro-Trump fake news on its platform during the 2016 presidential campaign. Days after the election, Facebook’s founder and chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, said it was a “pretty crazy idea” to suggest that fake news had influenced the outcome. It took months for him to admit that he was wrong to so cavalierly dismiss the importance of hoaxes spread on Facebook, many of them by people working on behalf of the Russian government.It is hard to know just how useful the profile information from Facebook was in Cambridge’s effort to help elect Mr. Trump. The company has offered contradictory statements about its use of what’s called “psychographic data” for the campaign, which included targeting political messages to voters receptive to them. The trove contained enough details about roughly 30 million people, including where they lived, that the company was able to build detailed profiles by linking the data to other sources of information.Officials in the United States and the European Union are investigating Cambridge Analytica, and others say they might, including members of Congress and the attorney general of Massachusetts, Maura Healey. In Britain, regulators and lawmakers are looking at whether the company tried to illegally influence the “Brexit” referendum of 2016.More investigations may be on the way. On Monday, Channel 4 News in Britain released hidden-camera tapes in which Cambridge executives said that their company used bribes and prostitutes to entrap politicians. The company denies engaging in corruption and extortion. Robert Mercer, the hedge fund billionaire who is a big supporter of Mr. Trump, owns a controlling stake in Cambridge, and Stephen Bannon, the former chief strategist for the president, is a former company board member.Lawmakers and regulators also ought to investigate Facebook’s response. For starters, they need to take a close look at whether the company is in violation of a 2011 consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission, which had accused it of deceiving users by telling them their information would be kept private and then allowing it to be shared and made public. They also need to force the company to quickly identify and alert the tens of millions of people whose information might have been disclosed to Cambridge.In the longer term, Congress clearly needs to strengthen privacy laws to give people more control over private information and prevent businesses and political campaigns from harvesting personal data under false pretenses. President Barack Obama proposed a privacy bill of rights in 2012, but the idea died in Congress after technology and advertising companies claimed it would be an unfair burden.Facebook says it takes this case seriously. But it is clear that lawmakers cannot rely on the company to police itself.

        Worries that the Trump administration’s protectionist policies could ignite a trade war between the world’s two largest economies punished equities last week. American stocks endured their worst week in two years as the Dow lost 1,400 points, or 5.7 percent.Tensions seemed to relax over the weekend. The WSJ reported late Sunday that “China and the U.S. have quietly started negotiating to improve U.S. access to Chinese markets.” Also, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in an interview that he’s “cautiously hopeful” that China will reach a deal to avoid tariffs.Shares jumped at the open and the momentum gained through the day as last week’s hardest hit sectors led the way.• The S.&P. 500 technology sector rose 4 percent. Microsoft and Apple gained 7.6 percent and 4.8 percent, respectively.• The KBW Bank Index climbed 3 percent on Monday, after tumbling 8 percent last week. Bank of America finished up 4.4 percent, while Morgan Stanley gained 4.3 percent. The two stocks had fallen nearly 5 percent on Friday.• Even Facebook, which was down 6.5 percent earlier in the day from the continued fallout from the Cambridge Analytica scandal, was able to eek out gains. The stock finished up 0.4 percent higher.• Gun stocks were the exception. Shares of publicly traded firearms companies fell in the wake Remington Outdoor bankruptcy filing and this weekend rallies for gun control. American Outdoor Brands fell 2.3 percent, Vista Outdoor dropped 3.8 percent and Sturm, Ruger & Co. slipped less than 1 percent.Photo

            A reality check on the White House’s tariff tacticsInvestors last week looked at President Trump’s tariffs against Chinese products and seemed to conclude that he was taking the U.S. into a trade war with China. The stock market plunged 6 percent.

Perhaps eager to stop the rout, the White House on Monday had a less confrontational message: Mr. Trump is applying one of his negotiating tactics. According to this view, the tariff proposal was a jarring move partly aimed at getting China to see that the U.S. was serious about wanting to make trade with China fairer.From a CNBC interview with Kevin Hassett, the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers:“From the beginning, all the way back to last summer when I arrived at the White House, the president has been clear that he wants to set a marker down with some big asks at the beginning, he doesn’t want to dribble them out, and then he wants his negotiators to try to fix the trade problems. ...Hopefully, it all works out with negotiation.”Mr. Hassett’s comments were in response to a WSJ article reporting that China and the U.S. were quietly engaged in trade negotiations.Investors seemed somewhat relieved: The stock market was up 1.5 percent on Monday. Of course, if the stakes are small enough, a deal may get done in the coming months that allows both sides to claim victory. But it seems unlikely that China would quickly agree to a far-reaching overhaul of the rules that govern foreign investment in the country, a major area of dispute. Our colleagues Raymond Zhong and Paul Mozur showed the depth of the divide there.Mr. Trump could up the ante if China shows no real signs that it will open up considerably. That could roil the markets again. The White House may want to signal that it can take market turmoil in stride. Mr. Hassett on Monday seemed to say that the White House expects market sell-offs as it pursues its trade agenda.“If you start from a world where a bunch your intellectual technology is being stolen, then of course it’s going to increase risk premiums in the short run when you try to do something about it, but in the end it should be a positive for us if we can get them to just stop them disregarding the rules of international order.”(Rising risk premiums means investors require a better return on their stocks and bonds to cover higher risks. This usually involves a decline in price to make their returns look better to prospective buyers.)Still, the more conciliatory tone from the White House after the sell-off suggests there is not a strong desire for a full-on trade war.— Peter EavisShares of Facebook continue to slide.The stock is down 6.5 percent Monday morning as the Federal Trade Commission confirmed that it has opened an investigation into Facebook’s privacy practice.

Also on Monday, Senator Chuck Grassley, Republican of Iowa and chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, invited Mr. Zuckerberg to testify about privacy standards next month and also extended the invitation to Google’s chief executive, Sundar Pichai, and Twitter’s chief executive, Jack Dorsey.Facebook’s shares are down nearly 22 percent since its high in early February and off more than 18 percent since the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke more than a week ago.To put Facebook’s recent tumble in perspective: The stock is set for its worst monthly performance since August 2012. Over the past 10 days, Facebook has lost $100 billion in market value.Despite the fall, Wall Street has not soured on Facebook. Forty-four analysts have buy ratings on the stock, compare to just two who have sell ratings, according to Bloomberg.Photo

            Tim Cook thinks regulation of Facebook is inevitableThe Apple C.E.O. said at the China Development Forum in Beijing that the government should tighten privacy regulations, after last week’s revelations about Facebook and Cambridge Analytica:“I think that this certain situation is so dire and has become so large that probably some well-crafted regulation is necessary. The ability of anyone to know what you’ve been browsing about for years, who your contacts are, who their contacts are, things you like and dislike and every intimate detail of your life — from my own point of view, it shouldn’t exist.”Apple often uses privacy as a selling point, but Mr. Cook wasn’t the only critic. Elon Musk deleted SpaceX and Tesla’s Facebook pages, saying that the Tesla one “looks lame anyway.” Sir Martin Sorrell of the ad giant WPP said Facebook needed to “step up to the mark” and be responsible for content on its platform. And some companies have stopped buying ads on Facebook, highlighting how advertisers want more transparency about performance. (Users also complained that the Android app tracked calls and text messages.)Meanwhile, Facebook took out full-page ads in several British and American newspapers — including the NYT — for an apology signed by Mark Zuckerberg.Elsewhere in Cambridge Analytica news: A volunteer for the campaign for Britain to leave the E.U. said that a Canadian data company linked to Cambridge Analytica had played a role in the organization’s work. Groups campaigning against Brexit have written to Prime Minister Theresa May demanding an investigation into what members of her cabinet and her staff knew.Andrew’s takeMr. Cook’s points on privacy are absolutely right. But he has a tough needle to thread, given that Apple does business in China and acknowledges that it is “subject to each country’s laws” that it does business in. Apple encrypts all user data and says there is no back door — and I believe that — most security and political experts have speculated that Beijing might ultimately be able to gain access iCloud data for Chinese customers: It adopted a law requiring all cloud services to be operated by Chinese companies. Apple says that it lobbied against the new law, but ultimately complied.

Elsewhere in privacy: Growing calls for privacy could seriously dent the business model of ad-supported internet. Federal law enforcement officials are renewing a push for a legal mandate that would allow access to encrypted data in criminal investigations.Dan Loeb has taken a stake in UTC.The activist investor’s fund, Third Point, has built a position in United Technologies, according to an antitrust filing.He is the second activist investor to reveal a stake in the United Technologies during the past 30 days. On Feb. 28, Bill Ackman told CNBC that his Pershing Square had a position in the defense contractor.Context At a conference late last month, Greg Hayes, the chief executive of United Technologies, said the company was thinking of splitting up:“Is [United Technologies] a more valuable property together or is UTC better off in three separate businesses? That’s the question for the board. That’s the question we continue to study.”Shares of United Technologies are up nearly 3 percent on Monday.USG rejects Knauf’s buyout offer.Gebr Knauf disclosed in a filing on Monday that it had offered to buy USG for $42 a share, or about $6 billion. That marked a 25 percent premium to USG closing price on Friday.In rejecting the offer, USG said the proposal substantially undervalued the building products maker.Knauf owns 10.5 percent of USG, making Knauf the second-largest shareholder in USG behind Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway with a 31 percent stake.Berkshire had proposed an option for Knauf to buy Berkshire’s stake in USG, according to the filing. The option would be exercisable only if Knauf bought all of USG’s shares outstanding for at least $42. Berkshire proposed an option purchase price of $2 per share.From Reuters:The option provides a sweetener for Buffett to shed a profitable investment that originated in late 2008, at the height of the housing crisis, when Berkshire and Canada’s Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd bought $400 million of USG’s debt.
The $2 per share cost of the option would provide Berkshire about $86.8 million upfront, based on its 43.39 million share USG stake. Berkshire would keep that money even if Knauf proved unable to buy USG.Shares of USG are up 19 percent Monday.Photo

            Eddie Lampert finally speaks about SearsWith Sears Holdings increasingly desperate in its efforts to stay afloat, the company’s C.E.O. gave his first in-depth interview in roughly 15 years to William D. Cohan of Vanity Fair. Mr. Lampert spoke about his past successes and his current travails as the head of the troubled retailer. (Mr. Cohan also spoke with Renaldo Rose, the man who spearheaded the kidnapping of Mr. Lampert in 2003.)

The money quote, from Mr. Lampert:“Put it this way, if I consider all the other alternatives, they’re not great for a lot of people and I just want to be responsible. If I didn’t believe that this company could be transformed still — the window is definitely shrinking — but if I didn’t believe that, I would try to take a different path. But I don’t know what that path exactly would be. It’s not a question of giving up or not giving up.”A bonus quote on Steven Mnuchin, Mr. Lampert’s college roommate and a director of Sears before becoming Treasury secretary, from Mark Cohen, the former C.E.O. of Sears Canada:“[With] all of Trump’s focus on jobs, job preservation, job creation, somebody ought to ask his secretary of the Treasury what his involvement has been for 11 years in the destruction of well over 100,000 jobs at Sears.”Photo

            Behind Washington and Beijing’s back-channel tariffs talksAfter a Friday that saw the markets sink amid fears of a trade war, the U.S. and China are holding high-level talks to defuse tensions, the WSJ reports. Leading them: Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Liu He, Beijing’s economic czar.Among Washington’s requests, in a letter to Mr. Liu, were lower Chinese tariffs on American cars and more freedom for Wall Street firms to expand in China.Mr. Mnuchin told “Fox News Sunday” that he believed the recent rate increase by the Federal Reserve was to blame for recent market declines, not tariffs. He added, “We’re not afraid of a trade war, but that’s not our objective.”News of the talks have lifted markets in Asia and Europe, while S.&P. 500 futures jumped this morning. It will also undoubtedly ease the fears of C.E.O.s, economists and foreign leaders and allies who have openly fretted about the prospect of a trade war. A sample quote, from Larry Fink of BlackRock: “The world does not need a public fight in which we reduce future opportunities.”The political flyaround• Stormy Daniels told “60 Minutes” that she signed a nondisclosure agreement, for which she received $130,000, about an alleged affair with Donald J. Trump because she was worried about her safety and that of her daughter. “Leave Trump alone,” a stranger told her in 2011. Read the NYT profile of her from this weekend.•  President Trump decided not to add Joseph diGenova and Victoria Toensing to his legal defense team in the special counsel’s investigation. That team now largely consists of one lawyer, Jay Sekulow.• The spotlight has fallen on Elliott Broidy, a top Republican fund-raiser who promised White House access to his investment and defense contractor clients.

The biggest problems for the firearms maker: too much debt after being sold to Cerberus Capital Management, and a drop in gun sales after Hillary Clinton lost the presidential election in 2016.

On guns and politics: Brad Karp and Christopher Boehning of the law firm Paul Weiss argue that firearms manufacturers should lose legal immunity to lawsuits tied to gun deaths. Saturday’s marches could make gun control a potent issue in the midterm elections. And the U.S.’s broad support for gun control has many nuances.Photo

            Barry Diller on the #MeToo eraThe media mogul spoke to Maureen Dowd of the NYT about: President Trump (not a fan); the current state of the media business (bullish on Netflix, bearish on Hollywood); and cloning his late dog, Shannon (he did it). Here’s what he had to say about workplace misconduct:“We recently had a formal complaint made by a woman who said that she was at a convention with her colleagues and she was asked to have a drink with her boss. Period. That was the complaint. And we said, ‘Here’s the thing. Anybody can ask you anything, other than let’s presume something illegal, and you have the right to say “Yes” or “No.” If it’s “Yes,” go in good health and if it’s “No,” then it’s full stop.’
“But the end result of that is a guy, let’s presume he is heterosexual, and his boss, heterosexual, and guy asks guy for a drink and they go have a drink and they talk about career opportunities. And the boss says, ‘Oh, this is a smart guy. I’m promoting him.’ A woman now cannot be in that position. So all these things are a-changin’.”But he also added, “Other than psychopaths, I think all of this bad behavior is finished.”Photo

            Uber’s deal to exit Southeast Asia is doneThe ride-hailing giant finally sealed a deal to sell its Southeast Asian business to the (SoftBank-backed) Grab in exchange for a stake in its competitor. Like the sale of its Chinese and Russian businesses, this gets Uber out of a costly fight as it readies for an I.P.O. next year. But does this mean that Uber is also set to leave other competitive markets, like India?On self-driving cars: Even before a pedestrian was killed in Tempe, Ariz., Uber was struggling with its autonomous vehicle efforts, needing human intervention nearly every 13 miles on average in Arizona tests. Those technical issues made being an operator of Uber’s cars very stressful.Elsewhere in tech: Amazon is collecting local taxes, but several cities aren’t seeing a dime. And why haven’t smart kitchen devices taken off?The speed read• SoftBank’s board is investigating who was behind a shareholder campaign that sought the ouster of two of its executives, unnamed sources said. It is also considering a $1 billion investment in a Chinese truck-hailing company, according to unnamed sources.• After naming Yi Gang the governor of China’s central bank, Beijing has put another reformer, Guo Shuqing, above him as the bank’s Communist Party secretary.

        As Silicon Valley experiences a wave of criticism, even some former colleagues are becoming adversaries.Another prominent skeptic spoke out this week, as a creator of one of Facebook’s top products waded into criticism of the internet giant.“It is time. #deletefacebook,” wrote Brian Acton, one of the founders of WhatsApp, wrote on Twitter. His company was bought by Facebook for $19 billion in 2014. The deal made him a billionaire.Mr. Acton’s anti-Facebook message, retweeted more than 10,000 times, captured a moment in the tech industry when even some of its best-known people are publicly calling for change. The chorus has grown louder this week, as Facebook faces questions over how it allowed a political consulting firm, Cambridge Analytica, to obtain data on 50 million users.

“The question is, ‘What are you loyal to?’” said Tristan Harris, a former Google employee who has started The Center for Humane Technology, an organization for Silicon Valley workers who want to change corporate culture. He has been critical of social media companies for creating addictive products that inflame cultural tensions.        Continue reading the main story

        “Are you more loyal to your company,” Mr. Harris said. “Or are you more loyal to protecting the fabric of our society?”The tech defections have accelerated in recent months, especially for Facebook.Justin Rosenstein, the creator of the Facebook “like” button, deleted the product from his phone and spoke out about the industry using psychologically manipulative advertising. Chamath Palihapitiya, Facebook’s former head of user growth, said in December that the company was “ripping apart the social fabric of how society works.” And Sandy Parakilas, a former Facebook platform operations manager, wrote on Tuesday in The Washington Post that Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, must “be held accountable for the negligence of his company.”Loyalty to a company is beginning to crack because many tech workers are being asked to build or defend products they question, Mr. Harris said. His center is making resources for engineers on how to build more ethical products and starting an educational campaign, called “The Truth About Tech,” in 55,000 American schools.“More people are speaking up because they feel like they’ve been told lies,” Mr. Harris said. “You can’t just repeat, ‘We’re making the world more open’ over and over and over again while democracy is burning.”

Silicon Valley companies have long prized secrecy and loyalty among their workers, who often exercise, play sports and eat three meals a day together. Facebook especially is known for its tight-knit community. Each employee has an annual “Faceversary” on his or her hire date, a ritual that within the company is seen as deeply meaningful and is usually accompanied by balloons.“Until very recently, it was taken as a given that tech equaled progress and tech equaled good and tech equaled economic strength,” said Leslie Berlin, the author of Troublemakers, a history of Silicon Valley.She said the defections she sees now are historically unique.“The Valley was founded on this notion of, ‘We’re very open,’ ” Ms. Berlin said. “But the secrecy has always been there.”

“It’s been pretty much a straight line since the start of the Cold War until now,” she said. “This is something new.”Employees may feel the freedom to rebel because of Silicon Valley’s success, both technologically and financially. The technology platforms have become more powerful — and the fortunes much bigger — than the programmers ever expected. So while the industry’s power disturbs them, the wealth allows them to speak out without fear of retribution, Ms. Berlin said.“It’s the shadow of the success,” she said. “You have to understand them together.”Certainly, not everyone is critical. Mr. Acton’s WhatsApp co-founder, Jan Koum, is on the Facebook board of directors and remains deeply active on the platform, regularly posting pro-President Trump and anti-immigration news.And when former leaders have spoken out with criticisms of Facebook, the company has often responded aggressively.“They do yell,” said Roger McNamee, an early investor and adviser to Mark Zuckerberg, referring to Facebook leadership’s approach.But the culture of fear that the company has fostered among employees is not working anymore, he said.""Facebook is at one of those moments where everybody who works there has to ask which side of history do you want to be on,” Mr. McNamee said. “The facts are not only indisputable, they’re not even complete. It’s going to get worse.”

Sign up here.What to expect from Powell’s first Fed meeting.Federal Reserve policymakers conclude their March rate-setting meeting on Wednesday. It is the first such session with Jerome H. Powell as the central bank’s new chairman.With the job market tight and inflation picking up only gradually, the Fed is widely expected to raise rates by a quarter of a percentage point in what is likely to be the first of three rate increases this year.

After the meeting, Mr. Powell will hold his first news conference in his new role, where observers will be listening closely for any suggestion that the Fed might depart from its anticipated path, and, if so, why.        Continue reading the main story

        Here’s a look at what economists and money managers are expecting:Jan Hatzius, Goldman Sachs: “Public remarks by Fed officials suggest a broad shift in the committee’s outlook towards a potentially faster pace of tightening, and we expect the median dot to show four hikes in 2018, up from three at the December meeting. Additional hawkish changes—a move to three hikes in 2019 or an increase in the longer-run funds rate estimates—are also possible but not our base case.”Michelle Meyer, Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Ms. Meyer says she expects the Fed raise rates this meeting, but “unlike December where there were two dissents, we expect this decision to be unanimous given the shift in voters this year in the hawkish direction. The focus will be on the evolution of the dots: we look for the median to hold at three hikes for this year, but to shift up from two to three hikes in 2019. We also think the long-run dot will edge up to 2.875%. This would show a Fed that is more confident about its ability to deliver rate hikes, but without an urgency to front-load the tightening.”Ian Shepherdson, Pantheon Macroeconomics: Mr. Powell “is bound to be faced with questions along the lines of “Why are you not raising the dots in the wake of the substantial, unfunded fiscal easing?”. His reply, we suspect, will be something like: “It’s not our job to tell Congress how to conduct fiscal policy, and it’s too soon to assess the impact of the tax cuts and spending increases. Much of the easing of policy could be saved rather than spent, and there are encouraging signs that productivity is picking up, so any upturn in wage growth as a result of fiscal loosening need not necessarily generate higher inflation. In any event, with inflation well below target, gradual normalization is the best way to balance the risks of both future inflation and the premature ending of the cycle via excessive tightening.”Stephen Stanley, Amherst Pierpont: “The bulk of the interest in this week’s F.O.M.C. meeting will come from the updated dot and economic projections as well as any meaningful tweaks to the key elements of the F.O.M.C. statement. Any changes to the dots and statement language are likely to be in the hawkish direction, though I would expect that the new information will be more evolutionary than a radically different.”Steve Rick, CUNA Mutual Group: There is “a very strong case for not only raising rates this week, but potentially doing so in a more aggressive manner than previously forecasted at the end of 2017. I think we could see projections get updated to call for four hikes instead of three, with plans for lifting rates more in coming years as well.”Chris Zaccarelli, Independent Advisor Alliance: “Whether we have 3 or 4 rate hikes this year shouldn’t be that big of a difference to the economy, but it WILL have a big impact on market prices and market psychology. Every statement – whether spoken or written – will be highly scrutinized looking for clues as to whether the Fed Funds rate will be 1% higher (or only 75 bps) a year from now.”Photo

On Monday, Steven Mnuchin, the United States Treasury secretary, was peppered with requests from several countries for exemptions from the tariffs, which are being imposed in the name of national security.In an interview on the sidelines of the meeting, Mr. Mnuchin suggested exemptions to the tariffs could be announced “relatively quickly.”Mr. Mnuchin said:“I think we’ve been very transparent in describing our positions; I don’t think anything should be a surprise. This is all about free and fair and reciprocal trade.”Mr. Trump has already said he would exempt Canada and Mexico from the tariffs upon a successful renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, and he has indicated that other countries could also get exemptions. But the United States has yet to detail exactly what would qualify a country for an exemption, other than a vague reference to protecting the United States’ national security and reducing bilateral trade deficits.Countries including France, Argentina and South Korea pressed Mr. Mnuchin on Monday about being freed from the metals tariffs, arguing that, as United States allies, they should not be penalized on national security grounds. Mr. Mnuchin said that decisions were being made on a case-by-case basis and that there was not a one-size-fits-all approach to deciding which countries would be exempt. The tariffs go into effect on Friday.— Alan RappeportPhoto

            Pressure continues to mount on Facebook.The Federal Trade Commission has opened an investigation into whether Facebook violated an agreement with the agency on data privacy, reports Cecilia Kang of the NYT.The probe comes after reports that information on 50 million users was improperly obtained by the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica, according to a person with knowledge of the inquiry.The investigation, started in recent days, adds to the mounting pressureagainst Facebook in the United States and in the United Kingdom about its handling of the data. Cambridge Analytica used the information to help President Trump’s presidential campaign profile voters during the 2016 election.The F.T.C. and Facebook reached a settlement in 2011 after the agency accused the company of deceiving customers “by telling them they could keep their information on Facebook private, and then repeatedly allowing it to be shared and made public,” according to a statement at the time.

Facebook could face fines of thousands of dollars a day per violation if the commission finds Facebook violated terms of the settlement, Bloomberg reports.Shares of Facebook are down 2.5 percent in early trading.Facebook’s worst day in agesExhibit A: Its stock closed down nearly 7 percent, its worst performance in four years.Exhibit B: Its chief security officer, Alex Stamos, plans to leave after disagreements about how much the company should share about misuse of its platform. (He favored disclosure.)The overall problem: Reports about how the data firm Cambridge Analytica improperly harvested information from 50 million Facebook users are highlighting just how much governments itch to regulate the tech giant.And Facebook’s previous laissez-faire attitude toward data collection by apps has gone from feature to bug, Kevin Roose writes in his latest column.Peter Eavis’s take: Mark Zuckerberg’s unusually powerful position at the company may have played a role:Through his holding of special voting shares, Mr. Zuckerberg has an especially powerful position at Facebook that might shield him from the normal forces of accountability. C.E.O.s without that protection might do more to tackle a big problem because it more directly threatens their job security.More on Cambridge Analytica: An undercover investigation by Channel 4 News of Britain captured the firm’s C.E.O., Alexander Nix, suggesting the entrapment of a potential client’s political opponents with women and bribes. Britain’s information commissioner is now seeking a warrant to examine the firm’s data. And Facebook has hired a forensics firm to audit it.Critics’ corner• Jeff Goldfarb of Breakingviews writes, “Ten years ago, Zuckerberg hired Sheryl Sandberg to help turn his start-up into a serious corporation. It may be time for more adult supervision.”• The academic Zeynep Tufekci writes, “This wasn’t informed consent. This was the exploitation of user data and user trust.”

• Cass Sunstein of Bloomberg View writes, “It would be a mistake to take the fiasco as a reason to keep treasure troves of information out of the hands of people who can provide immensely valuable services with it.”• Dan Gallagher of Heard on the Street writes, “Facebook’s immense scale also has made it virtually impossible for alternatives to catch on. That, in turn, makes abuse of the platform more urgent for lawmakers.”Public service announcements: How to protect yourself on Facebook.

            A death that could set back self-driving carsUber has suspended its autonomous vehicle testing in four cities after a car in self-driving mode struck and killed a woman in Tempe, Ariz. Until now, regulators had been increasingly open to testing: Just this month, California said it would start letting self-driving cars operate without anyone behind the wheel. Arizona already had.The head of Carnegie Mellon’s self-driving car lab has urged a halt to testing, telling Axios, “The technology is not there yet.”The virtual currencies corner: The White House banned Venezuela’s virtual currency in a new round of sanctions. Morgan Stanley analysts said Bitcoin looked like the dot-com boom and bust, only way faster. How Zug, Switzerland, became a hotbed for digital money. And the Hong Kong and Australia stock exchanges are working to share blockchain information.

WASHINGTON — For 10 days, Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, has been under increasing pressure from lawmakers and regulators to answer questions about the improper harvesting of data of 50 million Facebook users by a British political consulting firm, Cambridge Analytica.Now Mr. Zuckerberg plans to go to Washington to explain himself.The chief executive has agreed to testify in at least one congressional hearing over the social network’s handling of customer data, according to people familiar with the decision. Specifically, he plans to appear next month before the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the arrangements were not public. Mr. Zuckerberg may make other appearances; he has also been asked to testify before the Senate and House Judiciary and Commerce Committees.His appearing on Capitol Hill could create a spectacle that is replayed online and on television for years to come, especially amid a backlash against the power of tech behemoths. Late last year, executives from Facebook, Google and Twitter showed up at congressional hearings to discuss Russian meddling online in the 2016 presidential election, putting faces to the tech platforms during criticism of their misuse.Congressional testimony by Silicon Valley chief executives is rare, and their appearances have each set off a media circus. In 2013, Apple’s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, addressed senators about his company’s tax practices. In 2011, Google’s chairman at the time, Eric Schmidt, spoke about the company’s search practices in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee. And in 1998, Bill Gates, who was Microsoft’s chief executive, defended his company against lawmakers’ assertions that he was building a monopoly — an argument he eventually lost in court.

“The committee is continuing to work with Facebook to determine a day and time for Mr. Zuckerberg to testify,” said Elena Hernandez, a spokeswoman for the House Energy and Commerce Committee.

CNN earlier reported that Mr. Zuckerberg had decided to testify in front of Congress.He has been under pressure to appear before Congress since reports on March 17 that Cambridge Analytica improperly obtained and used the data of 50 million Facebook users. The revelations immediately sparked a furor on both sides of the Atlantic, with regulators in Britain and the United States calling for Mr. Zuckerberg to discuss what happened.

        Those calls haven’t subsided, even though the chief executive issued a public statement last week outlining the steps that Facebook was taking to prevent improper  harvesting of the data of its 2.2. billion users. On Monday, the Federal Trade Commission confirmed that it was investigating how Facebook handles information about its users. Politicians including Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, have also pressed for Mr. Zuckerberg to appear on Capitol Hill.Mr. Zuckerberg has turned down some requests to go before lawmakers. He declined to appear this week before the British Parliament and answer questions about data privacy.Facebook staff have held marathon meetings and phone calls with staff from congressional committees over the past week, according to Facebook employees and others briefed on the matter. Rob Sherman, Facebook’s deputy chief privacy officer, and Molly Cutler, its associate general counsel, have met with staff from the House and Senate Commerce, Judiciary and Intelligence Committees, they said.Mr. Zuckerberg initially resisted speaking to Congress, and had asked if a senior Facebook executive could be sent to represent the company in his name, two Facebook employees familiar with the conversations said.Video

    After the public outcry over Facebook’s data and privacy settings, Mr. Zuckerberg was persuaded that he needed to appear, they said. In recent days, he told Facebook employees that he had come to understand he would have to testify.In an interview with CNN last week, Mr. Zuckerberg said that he would be “happy to” testify in front of Congress and that “it’s the right thing to do.” He added of Cambridge Analytica, “This was a major breach of trust, and I’m really sorry that this happened.”

Google and Twitter have also been called to testify before Congress on data privacy. The companies didn’t respond to requests for comment.Lawmakers have been frustrated in the past by Mr. Zuckerberg’s absence from hearings. Last year, Facebook sent its general counsel, Colin Stretch, to join lawyers from Twitter and Google to testify about social media’s role in spreading disinformation during the 2016 election. Lawmakers noted the absence of senior executives, including Mr. Zuckerberg, and repeatedly challenged Facebook to send its leaders to answer questions.In a recent interview, Senator John Kennedy, Republican of Louisiana, said Mr. Zuckerberg needed to directly answer questions from Congress about what kind of user data was being gathered and shared, because Facebook has been too vague about its practices. He said the attorneys for Facebook, Google and Twitter who testified about the 2016 election had “dodged questions.”“They didn’t say a damn thing, which was what they were paid to do,” Mr. Kennedy said. “I’d encourage Mr. Zuckerberg to do the common-sense thing and roll up his sleeves and take a meaningful amount of time talking to us about this.”

"95","How to Prevent Smart People From Spreading Dumb Ideas","AdvertisementOpinionSupported byOp-Ed ContributorHow to Prevent Smart People From Spreading Dumb IdeasImageCreditScott MenchinBy Michael J. SocolowMarch 22, 2018We have a serious problem, and it goes far beyond “fake news.” Too many Americans have no idea how to properly read a social media feed. As we’re coming to learn more and more, such ignorance seems to be plaguing almost everybody — regardless of educational attainment, economic class, age, race, political affiliation or gender.Some very smart people are helping to spread some very dumb ideas.We all know this is a problem. The recent federal indictment of a Russian company, the Internet Research Agency, lists the numerous ways Russian trolls and bots created phony events and leveraged social media to sow disruption throughout the 2016 presidential election. New revelations about Cambridge Analytica’s sophisticated use of Facebook data to target unsuspecting social media users reminds us how complex the issue has become. Even the pope has weighed in, using his bully pulpit to warn the world of this new global evil.ImageCreditScott MenchinBut there are some remarkably easy steps that each of us, on our own, can take to address this issue. By following these three simple guidelines, we can collaborate to help solve a problem that’s befuddling the geniuses who built Facebook and Twitter.If the problem is crowdsourced, then it seems obvious the solution will have to be crowdsourced as well. With that in mind, here are three easy steps each of us can take to help build a better civic polity. This advice will also help each of us look a little less foolish.1. No link? Not news! Every time somebody tweets “BREAKING” a little bell should go off in your head. Before you even read the rest of the news, look for the link. Average Americans almost never break news about big stories. Even most professional journalists lack the sources and experience to quickly verify sensational information. If news breaks on a truly important story, there should be a link to a credible news source. But I still regularly see tweets that have no connection to reality being retweeted thousands of times by people who should know better. Here’s but one example of completely fictional “news” that was retweeted over 46,000 times. It involved Haiti’s supposed reaction to President Trump’s recent insult:It was retweeted by the Harvard law professor Laurence Tribe. His retweet was retweeted over 2,000 times:Yet there’s no evidence anywhere that Haiti’s “high court” did this. There was no “emergency” session and there was no “agreement to unseal & release documents.” The event is fabricated. Remember: No link? Not news!2. I knew it! If breaking news on social media aligns perfectly with your carefully structured view of the world, then pause before liking it or retweeting it. Why? Because you — like most of us — have curated a personal news feed to confirm things you already suspected or “knew.” If you didn’t do this yourself (by unfriending people who dared argue politics with you on your feed), Facebook and Twitter are doing it for you. They structure your timeline to make it as agreeable as possible. Cambridge Analytica’s success was premised on building a distribution system tailored to precisely exploit the biases and preconceptions of specified Facebook users.But Cambridge Analytica is the symptom, not the disease. The larger problem is that unpleasant and frustrating information — no matter how accurate — is actively hidden from you to maximize your social media engagement. George Orwell once noted that he became a writer because he possessed “a facility with words and a power of facing unpleasant facts.” There’s no place for “unpleasant facts” in our social media universe. Were Orwell alive today, he’d remind us of the terrible political costs caused by this devolution in our informational habits.3. Why am I talking? My wife is a psychotherapist, and occasionally I skim her Psychotherapy Networker magazine. I read a piece by a therapist who realized his most effective communicative moments often occurred when he asked himself a simple question: “Why am I talking?” Inevitably this question shut him up and allowed him to absorb much more information. “Why am I talking” works out to a great acronym: WAIT. If we all just asked ourselves this simple question immediately before posting or retweeting, we’d all be better off. There are numerous reasons to participate in the public sphere, and everyone can contribute something valuable. But there’s also far too much noise out there, and we need to think more seriously and realistically about the added value of our own communication.These are three simple rules. Of course, they contradict every mechanism Facebook and Twitter uses to encourage our behavior on social media. Being more skeptical, engaging more selectively and prioritizing links to information providers outside our social media silos will hurt the bottom line of the social media giants. Using social media in a more responsible manner might ultimately leave these companies to rot away as they cede their civic responsibilities to the Russian trolls and bots dedicated to polluting our discourse. If they won’t act, it’s up to us. If we’re collectively smarter and more skeptical about social media as an information delivery device, it will ultimately lessen the influence that these corporations and trolls have on our civic governance.Michael J.

WASHINGTON — Federal regulators and state prosecutors are opening investigations into Facebook. Politicians in the United States and Europe are calling for its chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, to testify before them. Investors have cut the value of the social networking giant by about $50 billion in the past two days.They are all focused on the same thing: whether Facebook mishandled users’ data.Facebook has built its highly profitable social network off its users, selling advertisements based on their ages, interests and other details. But the scrutiny over the company’s vast trove of personal data — following a report that a political consulting firm had improperly obtained information of 50 million users — is taking direct aim at that lucrative formula.“Investors are reacting to fears of regulation and the consequences of regulation,” said Brian Wieser, a senior research analyst at Pivotal Research Group. “The scale of errors can only lead one to conclude these are systemic problems.”So far, most of the social network’s top executives have been silent. Mr. Zuckerberg, its founder, and Sheryl Sandberg, his top deputy, have not made any public statements in recent days. The pair did not appear at an employee meeting on Tuesday in Menlo Park, Calif., where the company is based.

At the meeting, employees asked questions about the continuing internal investigation into the use of Facebook data by the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica. The firm, which was tied to President Trump’s 2016 campaign, used the data to target messages to voters.        Continue reading the main story

        The meeting, which included Facebook’s deputy counsel, Paul Grewal, largely focused on the steps that Facebook was taking to ensure its data could no longer be misused by independent researchers, according to Facebook employees in attendance. Mr. Zuckerberg was expected to address employees on Friday, when the company holds an all-hands meeting.Photo

            The company has faced internal dissent over its broader role in spreading disinformation during the presidential campaign and its response to it. The tensions have prompted the planned departure of Alex Stamos, Facebook’s chief security officer, who plans to leave in August.The pressure on Facebook has been building for years.It started in the European Union, where regulators have taken an aggressive attitude toward Facebook and other American technology giants for their sway over the region’s 500 million people. The company has been the subject of several privacy investigations and charges by European regulators. Europe has approved a new privacy law, which takes effect in May, that will give users of Facebook, Google and other internet services more control over how their data is collected and what Silicon Valley companies know about them.After the 2016 presidential campaign, lawmakers at home joined the chorus of critics, citing the company’s role in Russia’s disinformation efforts. The social network was one of the top tools used by Russians to spread false news, and the company’s executives have struggled to explain what happened and how they would prevent foreign interference in the future.The Cambridge Analytica revelations have forced Facebook to scramble to assuage fresh concerns by regulators and lawmakers. The company is sending its representatives to Capitol Hill and arranging conversations with state attorneys general to try to answer questions about how the firm collected the information of Facebook users.The social networking giant is also facing an investigation by the Federal Trade Commission, which is looking into whether Facebook violated an agreement with the agency, according to a person with knowledge of the inquiry.The F.T.C. investigation is connected to a settlement the agency reached with Facebook in 2011 after finding that the company had told users that third-party apps on the social media site, like games, would not be allowed to access their data. But the apps, the agency found, were able to obtain almost all personal information about a user.

The current investigation has parallels. The information on the 50 million users was harvested in 2014 by an outside researcher, Aleksandr Kogan. Mr. Kogan, a professor at Cambridge University, paid users small sums to take a personality quiz and download an app, which collected private information from their profiles and from those of their friends. Facebook allowed that sort of data collection at the time.Photo
    
            
        Eric T. Schneiderman, New York’s attorney general, said he was joining his Massachusetts counterpart in her investigation into Facebook’s handling of user data. “Consumers have a right to know how their information is used — and companies like Facebook have a fundamental responsibility to protect their users’ personal information,” he said.

            Then, Mr. Kogan gave the information to Cambridge Analytica, a firm founded by Stephen K. Bannon, the former White House political adviser, and Robert Mercer, the wealthy Republican donor. Passing the information to a third party violated Facebook’s policies, the company said last week.“There are all sorts of obligations under the consent decree that may not have been honored here,” said David Vladeck, a former director of consumer protection at the F.T.C.The company could face fines of $40,000 a day per violation if the agency finds that Facebook broke the agreement.“We are aware of the issues that have been raised but cannot comment on whether we are investigating,” an F.T.C. spokeswoman said in a statement on Tuesday. “We take any allegations of violations of our consent decrees very seriously.”Facebook said it expected to receive questions from the F.T.C. related to potential violations of the 2011 consent decree. “We remain strongly committed to protecting people’s information,” Facebook’s deputy chief privacy officer, Rob Sherman, said in a statement. “We appreciate the opportunity to answer questions the F.T.C. may have.”The F.T.C. inquiry is just one piece of the regulatory backlash. On Tuesday, the New York attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, announced that he was joining the Massachusetts attorney general, Maura Healey, in an investigation into whether Facebook had failed to protect the privacy of users in those states. New Jersey’s attorney general announced a similar investigation.Mr. Schneiderman and Ms. Healey sent a letter to Facebook on Tuesday that demanded records of the communications between the company and Cambridge Analytica.

There have also been growing calls for the top leadership at Facebook to appear before American and British lawmakers to testify about the company and Cambridge Analytica.Senators Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, and John Kennedy, Republican of Louisiana, have asked the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, to hold a hearing. Republican leaders of the Senate Commerce Committee, organized by John Thune of South Dakota, wrote a letter on Monday to Mr. Zuckerberg demanding answers to questions about how the data had been collected and if users were able to control the misuse of data by third parties.“It’s time for Mr. Zuckerberg and the other C.E.O.s to testify before Congress,” Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, said on Tuesday. “The American people deserve answers about social media manipulation in the 2016 election.”Facebook staff members were scheduled to brief the office of Mr. Warner, the top Democrat on the Intelligence committee, and the offices of members of other committees, including Commerce, this week.“The possibility that Facebook has either not been transparent with consumers or has not been able to verify that third-party app developers are transparent with consumers is troubling,” Mr. Thune said in his letter.

On Tuesday morning, a committee within the British Parliament sent a letter to Mr. Zuckerberg that asked him to appear before the panel to answer questions on the company’s connection to Cambridge Analytica. The president of the European Parliament also requested an appearance by Mr. Zuckerberg.“The committee has repeatedly asked Facebook about how companies acquire and hold on to user data from their site, and in particular about whether data had been taken without their consent,” wrote Damian Collins, chairman of the British committee. “Your officials’ answers have consistently understated this risk, and have been misleading to the committee.”

"97","Trump Hacked the Media Right Before Our Eyes","AdvertisementOpinionSupported byRoss DouthatTrump Hacked the Media Right Before Our EyesImageWe never stopped watching.Credit Andrew Harrer/BloombergImageBy Ross DouthatMarch 21, 2018Let’s get one thing straight: I am not a fan of Facebook. I’m confident that social media is a cancer on our private lives and a source of derangement in our politics. I take it for granted that the tech barons are acquiring the power to tilt elections, and that they’ll be happy to play handmaidens to tyrants soft and hard so long as they can monetize our data. I take a certain mordant pleasure in watching Mark Zuckerberg and his minions scapegoated for the political failures of late-Obama-era liberalism.But the liberal establishment’s fixation on Facebook’s 2016 sins — first the transmission of fake news and now the exploitation of its data by the Trump campaign or its appendages — still feels like a classic example of blaming something new because it’s new when it’s the old thing that mattered more. Or of blaming something new because you thought that “new” meant “good,” that the use of social-media data by campaigns would always help tech-savvy liberals and not their troglodytic rivals — and the shock of discovering otherwise obscures the more important role that older forms of media played in making the Trump era a reality.No doubt all the activity on Facebook and the apparent use of Facebook’s data had some impact, somewhere, on Trump’s surprise victory. But the media format that really made him president, the one whose weaknesses and perversities and polarizing tendencies he brilliantly exploited, wasn’t Zuckerberg’s unreal kingdom; it wasn’t even the Twitter platform where Trump struts and frets and rages daily. It was that old pre-internet standby, broadcast and cable television, and especially TV news.Start with the fake news that laid the foundation for Trump’s presidential campaign — not the sort that circulates under clickbait headlines in your Facebook feed, but the sort broadcast in prime time by NBC, under the label of reality TV. Yes, as media sophisticates we’re all supposed to know that “reality” means “fake,” but in the beginning nobody marketed “The Apprentice” that way; across most of its run you saw a much-bankrupted real estate tycoon portrayed, week after week and season after season, as a titan of industry, the for-serious greatest businessman in the world.Where did so many people originally get the idea that Trump was the right guy to fix our manifestly broken government? Not from Russian bots or targeted social media ad buys, but from a prime-time show that sold itself as real, and sold him as a business genius. Forget unhappy blue collar heartlanders; forget white nationalists and birthers: The core Trump demographic might just have been Republicans who watched “The Apprentice,” who bought the fake news that his television program and its network sponsors gladly sold them.That was step one in the Trump hack of television media. Step two was the use of his celebrity to turn news channels into infomercials for his campaign. Yes, his fame also boosted him on social media, but there you can partially blame algorithms and the unwisdom of crowds; with television news there were actual human beings, charged with exercising news judgment and inclined to posture as civic-minded actors when it suits them, making the decision to hand day after day of free coverage to Donald Trump’s rallies, outrages, feuds and personal attacks.Nothing that Cambridge Analytica did to help the Trump campaign target swing voters (and there’s reason to think it didn’t do as much as it claimed) had anything remotely like the impact of this #alwaysTrump tsunami, which probably added up to more than $2 billion in effective advertising for his campaign during the primary season, a flood that drowned all of his rivals’ pathetic tens of millions. And as cynical as I believe the lords of Silicon Valley to be, the more important cynicism in 2016 belonged to those television execs who were fine with enabling the wild Trumpian takeover of the G.O.P., because after all Republicans deserved it and Hillary was sure to beat him in the end.Except that she didn’t beat him, in part because he also exploited the polarization that cable news, in particular, is designed to feed. In 2016 this polarization didn’t just mean that Fox became steadily more pro-Trump as he dispatched his G.O.P. rivals; it also meant that a network like CNN, which thrives on Team Red vs. Team Blue conflict, felt compelled to turn airtime over to Trump surrogates like Jeffrey Lord and Corey Lewandowski and Kayleigh McEnany because their regular stable of conservative commentators (I was one of them) simply wasn’t pro-Trump enough.The depth and breadth of Trump skepticism among right-wing pundits was a pretty solid indicator of his unfitness for high office. But especially once he won the nomination this skepticism was often filtered out of cable coverage, because the important thing was to maintain the partisan shouting-match model. This in turn encouraged a sense that this was just a typical right-versus-left election, in which you should vote for Trump if you usually voted for Republicans … and in the end that’s what most G.O.P. voters did.My own CNN experiences were positive; I admire the many fine journalists who work in television news. But it was clear enough being in that orbit in 2016, as it should be clear to anyone who watched Trump’s larger relationship to his television coverage, that the business model of our news channels both assumes and heightens polarization, and that it was ripe for exploitation by a demagogue who was also a celebrity.It’s also clear — as the economists Levi Boxell, Matthew Gentzkow and Jesse Shapiro wrote in these pages late last year — that among older white Americans, the core demographic where first the primaries and then the general election were decided, television still far outstrips the internet as the most important source of news. And indeed, the three economists noted, for all the talk about Breitbart’s influence and Russian meddling and dark web advertising, Trump only improved on Mitt Romney’s showing among Americans who don’t use the internet, and he “actually lost support among internet-using voters.” In a sense, you could argue, all those tweets mattered mainly because they kept being quoted on TV.Which is not to say that the current freakout over Facebook doesn’t make a certain kind of sense. Beyond the psychological satisfaction of weaving the often-genuinely-sinister side of Silicon Valley into stolen-election theories, there’s a strategic wisdom to the center-left establishment’s focus on the internet.What Trump did will be hard for a future demagogue to imitate: The generations who get their information from newscasts are dying out, the web is taking over at an accelerating pace and in the long run there is more to be gained in going after Mark Zuckerberg than in pillorying Jeff Zucker. And pillorying Fox’s hosts only helps their brand: the big tech companies regard themselves as part of the liberal cultural complex, so they’re vulnerable to progressive bullying and shaming; not so Sean Hannity, whose stalwart support for Trump was and remains vastly more important than any online stratagem.In the end, as Michael Brendan Dougherty wrote recently for National Review, one implicit goal of the Facebook freakout is to ensure that “conservatives and populists will not be allowed to use the same tools as Democrats and liberals again, or at least not use them effectively.” If the trauma of Trump’s victory turns social-media gatekeepers into more aggressive and self-conscious stewards of the liberal consensus, the current freakout will have more than served its political purpose.But like the television channels whose programming choices did far more than Facebook to make Donald Trump president, it won’t have served the truth.

    Why Leaving Facebook Doesn’t Always Mean Quitting

        
            
                In the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, in which data from over 50 million Facebook profiles was secretly scraped and mined for voter insights, many Facebook users have decided to delete their accounts — but untangling yourself from a site like Facebook is not as easy as pressing “delete.”

    In the wake of news that the Facebook data of 50 million people was obtained by Cambridge Analytica, a political data firm, many users are mulling whether it is time to leave the social network. Even a co-founder of WhatsApp, which Facebook bought for $16 billion in 2014, declared that it was time to delete Facebook.But while deleting your account is as simple as clicking on a few buttons, Facebook may be too ubiquitous to truly quit. For one, it would probably be inaccurate to say you have removed Facebook from your life just by leaving the site. Chances are you still use WhatsApp, the largest messaging app in the world, or Instagram, the most popular photo-sharing app. Facebook owns both.Keep in mind that Facebook isn’t the only company capable of collecting your information. One big culprit: Web trackers, like cookies embedded into websites and their ads. They are everywhere, and they follow your activities from site to site.You can quit Facebook if you simply find no joy in it. But if you’re looking to leave for philosophical reasons concerning privacy, it’s a futile effort. You may be better off tweaking your privacy settings on the site.

        What are the alternatives to using Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp?There is no real substitute for Facebook if you’re looking for a social network that includes virtually everyone you meet in real life. Social networks are all about the people on them, and Facebook has more than 2 billion monthly users. You could consider Snapchat, which has about 187 million daily users, but it’s a far different experience — you primarily use it to send photos that self-destruct — with an interface that many people find confusing.There are plenty of alternatives to WhatsApp. But they have drawbacks and aren’t as far-reaching as WhatsApp, which has more than 1.5 billion monthly users.Signal is a solid app for secure encrypted messaging — but it is still a young service with a relatively small number of users. You might be able to get hundreds of your friends to join Signal. But chances are you have friends or family in other countries, and WhatsApp is the go-to messaging service internationally. For example, practically every smartphone user in India — more than 200 million people — uses WhatsApp.Another WhatsApp alternative is WeChat, a Chinese messaging app that has about a billion monthly users. But the majority of people on that service are in China. And WeChat faces its own privacy issues because of China’s notorious reputation for mass surveillance. Tencent, the company that runs WeChat, denies that it stores the chat histories of its users. But WeChat users have been arrested over conversations they have had in the app, and chat transcripts have been used as evidence in court proceedings.Instagram, which has more than 800 million monthly users, is also a tough one, giving Facebook a stranglehold on photo sharing. The only real competitor to Instagram is Facebook itself, which has its own photo-sharing features. Remember Flickr? The Yahoo-owned site is the closest thing either has to a competitor, and it’s like a graveyard of people’s digital memories before they abandoned it for Facebook and Instagram.Google Photos is a compelling service, but it is a photo album management tool, not so much a social network.How else do you keep in touch with friends and family? How do you create and discover events? How do you market and manage customer service for your small business? How do you spark and build grass-roots movements?

Facebook is the one-stop shop to accomplish all those tasks. But if you have the patience, you can juggle multiple apps to cobble together the same experience.

Messaging apps are popular for keeping in touch with friends and family — a group chat between family members via text message, for example, is still an efficient way to keep in touch. And sites like MeetUp are designed for hosting and discovering events.As for customer service, many companies use Twitter to engage with their customers and resolve complaints. Yelp, the reviews site for local businesses, is a common place for customers to talk about their experiences, and business owners often engage with people there.For grass-roots movements, a Twitter hashtag might be enough. Recent examples include #metoo, the movement for people to discuss sexual assault, #deleteuber, the campaign to protest Uber last year amid political controversy, and now, there is the movement to #deletefacebook in response to the Cambridge Analytica controversy.What does it mean to delete Facebook? How can you actually delete your account?You can permanently delete your account by clicking a few buttons on Facebook’s website. The company delays deletion for a few days, so do not log back in. Facebook also offers a tool for extracting a copy of your data before deleting your account.After you delete your account, it won’t be recoverable. But there are caveats.Shadows of your digital self would remain on the site. For example, if people uploaded photos of you, those photos will still be there. The conversations you had with friends through Facebook won’t disappear, either.When you delete your account, you are only deleting the media you posted, like your status updates and photos that you uploaded. That’s not going to do much for your privacy, considering that an overwhelming amount of what you do on Facebook involves engaging with other people. All of your friends (and their friends, too) would also have to delete their accounts in order to have any sort of meaningful effect.What other things are you losing access to if you delete Facebook? Why do so many apps require a Facebook login?

One painful part of breaking up with Facebook would be potentially losing access to the many third-party apps and websites that are tied to your account. Over the past decade, many shopping sites and apps teamed up with Facebook to use the company’s login tool, Facebook Login.Facebook Login became popular because it was a good product. By clicking a button, you could sign up for an account with an app or website just by sharing your Facebook account data. That allowed you to skip manually entering details like your name and email address — a process that is especially cumbersome on a small smartphone screen. This sped up the process of signing up for an account to buy that pair of shoes you saw go on sale.If you were to delete Facebook, you would break your access to many sites and apps that you signed up for using Facebook Login. But fortunately, many sites and apps still let you sign up for accounts directly through them, and many also let you log in through your Google account.It’s not impossible to delete Facebook. But it would be a long and tedious process to create new accounts for all the apps and sites you use.Where does Facebook really equal the internet?Keep in mind that Facebook reaches well beyond the United States. As my colleague Sheera Frenkel noted on Twitter, deleting Facebook is a privilege. In some parts of the world, like Myanmar, Egypt and Indonesia, people rely on Facebook as a primary means to conduct business and stay in touch with friends and family. In Africa, Facebook has struck deals that offer basic services — centered on those provided by Facebook — to residents for free.

        LONDON —  The computer expert who alleges a trove of Facebook data was improperly used to help Donald Trump's White House bid said Tuesday that he strongly believes the information was also used by the Brexit movement that persuaded Britain to quit the European Union.In a 3½-hour hearing, Chris Wylie told the House of Commons media committee that he believes the breach exceeded the 50 million Facebook users reported earlier — though he didn't give an exact figure. And he said the data compiled by the political consulting business Cambridge Analytica was available to other firms with links to it.""All kinds of people had access to the data,"" said Wylie, who helped develop Cambridge Analytica's methods for using the information to target and persuade voters. ""It was everywhere.""Among the companies that had access to the data was AggregateIQ, a Canadian political consultant that did work for Vote Leave, the official campaign backing Britain's withdrawal from the EU, Wylie said.

Wylie described Cambridge Analytica as just one arm of a global company, SCL Group, that gets most of its income from military contracts but is also a political gun-for-hire, often in countries where democratic institutions are weak. He suggested the company combines computer algorithms and dirty tricks to help candidates win regardless of the cost.        Continue reading the main story

        The 28-year-old Canadian with a swath of pink hair says he helped set up Cambridge Analytica in 2013. He left the next year.Wylie has previously alleged that Cambridge Analytica used personal data improperly collected from Facebook users to help Trump's 2016 presidential campaign.Cambridge Analytica says none of the Facebook data was used in its work on the Trump campaign. It denies any wrongdoing.Cambridge Analytica's acting CEO, Alexander Tayler, said in a statement that Wylie was a part-time contractor who ""has no direct knowledge of our work or practices"" since he left the company.Wylie said he ""absolutely"" believes AggregateIQ drew on Cambridge Analytica's databases for its work on the Brexit campaign. In the closely fought referendum in 2016, 51.9 percent of voters backed Britain's departure from the EU.

""I think it is incredibly reasonable to say that AIQ played a very significant role in Leave winning,"" Wylie said.He testified that AggregateIQ was formed when Cambridge Analytica sought to expand but Canadians he wanted to bring into the business didn't want to relocate to Britain. The two firms shared underlying technology and worked so closely together that Cambridge Analytica staff often referred to the Canadian firm as a ""department,"" he said.Because of the links between the two companies, Vote Leave got the ""the next best thing"" to Cambridge Analytica when it hired AggregateIQ, ""a company that can do virtually everything that (Cambridge Analytica) can do but with a different billing name,"" Wylie said.

AggregateIQ, based in Victoria, British Columbia, issued a statement saying it has never been part of Cambridge Analytica or SCL.""AggregateIQ works in full compliance within all legal and regulatory requirements in all jurisdictions where it operates,"" the company said. ""All work AggregateIQ does for each client is kept separate from every other client.""Wylie's testimony came a day after Wylie and two other former insiders presented 50 pages of documents that they said proved Vote Leave violated election finance rules during the referendum campaign.They allege that Vote Leave circumvented spending limits by donating 625,000 pounds ($888,000) to the pro-Brexit student group BeLeave, which then sent the money directly to AggregateIQ.Vote Leave denies breaking any campaign finance regulations. Dominic Cummings, the Vote Leave strategist, called Wylie a ""fantasist-charlatan.""        Continue reading the main story

        LONDON —  A Cambridge Analytica whistleblower said on Tuesday that Canadian company AggregateIQ worked on software called Ripon which was used to identify Republican voters ahead of the 2016 U.S. presidential election.AggregateIQ did not immediately respond to request for comment on the remarks by Christopher Wylie, a whistleblower formerly of British political consultancy Cambridge Analytica.Wylie has previously disclosed how users' data from Facebook was used by Cambridge Analytica to help elect U.S. President Donald Trump.Ripon, the town in which the Republican Party was founded in 1854, was the name given to a tool that let a campaign manage its voter database, target specific voters, conduct canvassing, manage fundraising and carry out surveys.

""There's now tangible proof in the public domain that AIQ actually built Ripon, which is the software that utilised the algorithms from the Facebook data,"" Wylie told the British Parliament's Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee.

        NEW YORK —  Facebook is having one of its worst weeks as a publicly traded company with a share sell-off continuing for a second day.Britain's Commissioner Elizabeth Denham told the BBC that she was investigating Facebook and has asked the company not to pursue its own audit of Cambridge Analytica's data use. Denham is also pursuing a warrant to search Cambridge Analytica's servers.Facebook's stock tumbled 2 percent at the opening bell Tuesday following its worst trading day in four years.Facebook Inc. is coming under intense scrutiny since The New York Times and The Guardian newspaper reported that former Trump campaign consultant Cambridge Analytica used data, including user likes, inappropriately obtained from roughly 50 million Facebook users to try to sway elections.

        LONDON —  Chris Wylie can't prove the work he did for Cambridge Analytica helped Donald Trump win the 2016 presidential election, but he thinks he has pretty good evidence.While working for the political consulting company from 2013 to 2015, Wylie's team spoke to Americans in focus groups to identify deep-seated concerns. Then they tested ways to tap into those fears through social media. The slogans they developed later became the catchphrases of the Trump campaign, he says.""My ears perked up when I started hearing some of these things like 'drain the swamp' or 'build the wall' or 'the deep state' because these were all narratives that had come out from the research that we were doing,"" Wylie told an audience at London's Frontline Club on Tuesday night.The 28-year-old Canadian is at the center of allegations that Cambridge Analytica improperly used data from over 50 million Facebook users to identify voters who might be sympathetic to Trump's message and target them with social media messages. In stories by the New York Times and Britain's Guardian newspaper over the past week, he explained how he created the psychological warfare tools for Steve Bannon, the right-wing former banker who later became Trump's chief strategist.

        Wylie says Facebook data collected by a Cambridge University researcher was used as part of a project commissioned by Cambridge Analytica. The firm says none of the Facebook data was used in the work it did for the Trump campaign. Facebook has suspended Wylie and Cambridge Analytica while it investigates the allegations.Wylie was in his early 20s and had been working on a PhD in fashion trend forecasting when he went to work for defense and intelligence contractor SCL Group, which later teamed with Bannon to create Cambridge Analytica. Alexander Nix, CEO of Cambridge Analytica, offered the ""freedom to explore the research I really wanted to do,"" Wylie said.Bannon, unlike other clients, wasn't impressed by Nix's posh pedigree or fancy meals at exclusive London restaurants, so they closed the deal by setting up an office in Cambridge to align the new company with the history and prestige of Cambridge University.""We presented ourselves as much more academic. Not to say that we weren't academic, but we needed to curate our presentation so we created this fake office ... beside the university to make it look like this is our Cambridge site. This is our Potemkin Cambridge office.' ""But the data was real, and Cambridge Analytica used that information, together with insights gained from focus groups with angry Americans, to identify issues and target voters. Bannon supplied the ideological focus of wanting to remake America and billionaire Robert Mercer provided the money. Neither Bannon nor Mercer has publicly commented since the allegations emerged.

The work was a mix of old-fashioned canvassing and the use of millions of data points to test out slogans and push them onto social media.""We would just go chat with people. We would go sit in their living rooms. We would look at how they live,"" said Wylie.He said Cambridge Analytica had an advantage in listening to Americans because as foreigners they may have had fewer preconceptions.

""One of the things that started to emerge was that we literally heard these sort of narratives about Washington as something that was, like, gross and disgusting, that was dirty,"" Wylie said.So his team tested the phrase ""drain that swamp"" to see if people would respond to it on social media. After all, they had access to the data of millions of Facebook users without their knowledge.And people responded. Through the internet and Trump's speeches, the slogan became one of the campaign's most identifiable soundbites.Perhaps it is the idea of building a wall along the Mexican border that best illustrates Wylie's work for Cambridge Analytica.Bannon, Wylie said, was obsessed with the idea of separating the U.S. from the rest of the world so the country can rediscover itself. Trump's campaign for a wall along the Mexican border is not really about stopping immigrants, Wylie said.""It's to embody separation,"" he said. ""If you can embody that separation and you can further distance in the minds of Americans us here in America and them elsewhere, even if it is just across a river, or just across a desert, then you have won that culture war.""

        NEW YORK —  The Latest on Cambridge Analytica's use of Facebook data (all times local):5:45 p.m.The New York Times says Facebook's chief information security officer is leaving in August .The newspaper, citing current and former employees it did not name, said Alex Stamos will leave after a disagreement over how the social network should deal with its role in spreading misinformation.It said Stamos pushed to do more to investigate and disclose Russian activity and that he stayed to oversee transferring some 100 people in his group to other divisions.A Facebook spokeswoman did not address whether Stamos is leaving, although she pointed to a tweet in which Stamos says he's still fully engaged at Facebook but that his role has changed.

        CEO Alexander Nix is seen in the video saying the company has secretly recorded agents offering corrupt campaign financing deals to politicians and has sent ""girls around to the candidate's house"" to create damaging videos.Channel 4 said its reporter posed as a wealthy Sri Lankan looking to hire the company.The firm was suspended from Facebook on Friday after reportedly scraping some 50 million user profiles in a pro-Trump manipulation campaign.Cambridge said its executives merely humored the questions before leaving with grave concerns.___5:50 p.m.Britain's information commissioner says she will apply for a warrant to access the servers of Cambridge Analytica, which allegedly used data mined from Facebook to help Donald Trump win the 2016 presidential election.Commissioner Elizabeth Denham said in a statement Monday that she planned to seek the warrant because the British firm had been ""uncooperative"" in her investigation of whether Facebook data was ""illegally acquired and used.""Denham said: ""This is a complex and far-reaching investigation for my office, and any criminal or civil enforcement actions arising from it will be pursued vigorously""___4:10 p.m.Data from the Federal Election Commission show that Cambridge Analytica, the firm under fire for inappropriately obtaining Facebook data, earned $5.9 million in 2016 from the campaign to elect Donald Trump for president.

Cambridge also earned $5.8 million from Sen. Ted Cruz's failed presidential campaign.Cambridge is under increasing scrutiny after newspapers reported the firm obtained data on 50 million Facebook users without their knowledge to subject them to political messages. The company is funded in part by Trump supporter and billionaire financier Robert Mercer.Facebook suspended the company from using its services Friday, hours before the reports came out.In total, Cambridge Analytica earned more than $16 million from 2014 to 2016 from nearly 20 Republican candidates and political committees.___3:55 p.m.A newspaper editor says Facebook had threatened to sue The Observer and its sibling The Guardian over its investigation of a Trump-affiliated data-mining firm, Cambridge Analytica.Stories in The Guardian and The New York Times detail how Cambridge Analytica used an app to obtain user data on some 50 million people without their knowledge in order to subject them to political propaganda. John Mulholland, The Observer's outgoing editor, discloses the lawsuit threat in a Friday tweet .A Facebook spokesman say the company sent a letter to the Observer to make the case ""that this did not represent a data breach."" He didn't respond to questions about whether Facebook threatened legal action.___3:40 p.m.Facebook makes it easy for advertisers to target users based on nuanced information about them. But experts say it's difficult to conclude whether data collection by a Trump-affiliated political firm, Cambridge Analytica, influenced the election.Jonathan Albright of Columbia University says for this to change Facebook would have to reveal the questions on the psychological profile quiz — or quizzes — that its users took. Then researchers could begin to determine how this data was used to target people.McKenzie Funk, an Open Society fellow and journalist, has outlined how Cambridge Analytica could have used such psychosocial profiling. In a November 2016 op-ed in The New York Times, he writes that President Donald Trump's digital team used hyper-targeted posts to serve different ads to different potential voters, ""aiming to push the exact right buttons"" at the right time.

The audit, Facebook says, is to determine if the Facebook data the Cambridge collected still exists or if it's been destroyed.Facebook has also approached two other individuals — former Cambridge employee-turned-whistleblower Christopher Wylie, and University of Cambridge professor Aleksandr Kogan, who did the scraping — to submit to audits as well.Cambridge denies keeping data from Kogan's work. Facebook said it would be a ""grave violation"" of its policies if the data still exists.___1:15 p.m.Experts are saying that Cambridge Analytica, the political firm under fire for inappropriately obtaining data from Facebook, isn't alone in its data-mining capability.Robert Ricci, a marketing director at Blue Fountain Media, says what makes this case more insidious is its connection with possible elections meddling, something Facebook has been under scrutiny for.Ricci says marketers are already using similar profiling techniques to sell products and services. What's different here is the use of data to try to influence who you are voting for — or whether you are voting at all.Cambridge Analytica, whose clients have included Donald Trump's presidential campaign, reportedly used the data of 50 million Facebook customers without permission to build psychological profiles so voters could be targeted with ads and stories.

___1 p.m.The head of the European Union's parliament says the bloc will investigate Facebook over the use of its data by a Trump-affiliated data-mining firm.Cambridge Analytica, whose clients have included Donald Trump's presidential campaign, reportedly used the data of 50 million Facebook customers without permission to build psychological profiles so voters could be targeted with ads and stories.Antonio Tajani tweeted on Monday: ""Allegations of misuse of Facebook user data is an unacceptable violation of our citizens' privacy rights. The European Parliament will investigate fully, calling digital platforms to account."" Tajani, who is president of the EU parliament, hasn't provided details.U.K. lawmakers have already called on Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to testify before a parliamentary committee about this case.___12:35 p.m.Facebook is having its worst trading day since 2012 as details emerge about how a data mining company working for the Trump campaign improperly obtained and kept data on tens of millions of users during the 2016 election.A former employee of Cambridge Analytica said Monday on NBC's ""Today"" that the group identified voters who might be swayed and ""injected content"" that may or may not be true. Late Friday, Facebook said it would ban Cambridge Analytica, saying the company improperly obtained information from 270,000 people who downloaded a purported research app described as a personality test. Facebook first learned of the breach more than two years ago, but hasn't disclosed it until now.Facebook shares sank $13.43 in midday trading, putting the stock on pace for its biggest one-day fall since August 2012 and dragging down the rest of the technology sector, with fears rising of increased government regulation.Alphabet, Google's parent company, lost almost 3 percent and Microsoft fell almost 2 percent._______11:30 a.m.

A former employee of a Trump-affiliated data-mining firm says it used algorithms that ""took fake news to the next level"" using data inappropriately obtained from Facebook.Chris Wylie says the firm, Cambridge Analytica, secured personal data in order to learn about individuals and then used it to create an information cocoon to change their perceptions.He says the firm used ""informational dominance"" to capture every channel of information around a person to surround them with curated information, changing their perception of what's actually happening.In an interview Monday on NBC's ""Today,"" Wylie said Cambridge Analytica aimed to ""explore mental vulnerabilities of people.While Wylie said he doesn't know to what extent Trump's campaign used the techniques, he said Trump's former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski was meeting with Cambridge Analytica in 2015, before Trump even announced his run for office.

        NAIROBI —  Kenya's ruling Jubilee party said on Tuesday it had paid for ""branding"" in the 2017 presidential election from SCL, affiliate of consultancy Cambridge Analytica, which is at the center of an election manipulation scandal involving Facebook.Best known for helping Donald Trump's U.S. presidential bid in 2016, the London-based consultancy also ran the campaigns of Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta in the 2013 and 2017 elections, according to video secretly recorded and broadcast by Britain's Channel 4 News on Monday.Commenting on the role of SCL in last year's Kenyan election, an ethnically divisive affair in which about 100 people were killed, Jubilee vice-chairman David Murathe said:  ""They were basically branding and all that but not directly.""It was the first public comment by a senior official of Kenya's ruling party on SCL's involvement in the election.

The consultancy is currently facing a search of its London office and questions from U.S. state authorities after a whistleblower revealed it had harvested the private information of millions of people to support Trump's presidential bid.Kenya's opposition reacted angrily to the reports of Cambridge Analytica's involvement in the Kenyan elections.""The same propaganda that they used in Trump's election is what has been used in Kenya. Cambridge Analytica is now becoming an international propagandist,"" said Junet Mohamed, a lawmaker for Odinga's ODM party and its director of elections.However, Jubilee senator Kipchumba Murkomen denied any influence on the election, saying that social media were of only marginal influence in Kenya despite its reputation as one of Africa's most tech-savvy nations.""Those things don't influence elections in Kenya,"" he said. ""Kenya is not America. In Kenya, vernacular radio stations are more influential than those things.""(Reporting by Duncan Miriri and George Obulutsa; Editing by Ed Cropley and Gareth Jones)        Continue reading the main story

        (Reuters) - The European Commission pressed Facebook on Monday over whether EU citizens' data were among those improperly harvested by a British political consultancy, after the U.S. regulator said it was investigating the firm's privacy practices.That piled yet more pressure on a firm that has lost more than $100 billion in market value in the last 10 days.Facebook shares fell more than 5 percent on Monday after the U.S. consumer protection regulator made public its investigation of how the social network allowed data of 50 million users to get into the hands of Cambridge Analytica.Facebook executives have apologized after reports emerged that Cambridge Analytica had used personal data to target U.S. voters.

""As Mark Zuckerberg said this week, we are working hard to tackle past abuse, prevent future abuse and give people more prominent controls,"" the Facebook spokeswoman said.Germany's justice minister called for stricter rules for Facebook after meeting with company executives on Monday who said around 1 percent of 300,000 users of a personality quiz whose results were later fed into Cambridge Analytica's voter-targeting algorithms were in Europe.Jourova said she wanted a reply to her letter within two weeks.The Cambridge Analytica scandal emerged only a few months before a landmark EU data protection law comes into force under which companies found to be in breach could be fined up to 4 percent of global turnover.Any eventual sanctions for Facebook will fall under the current privacy regulations, and so would be much lower.Britain's data watchdog is taking the lead in investigating Facebook and Cambridge Analytica from the European side, and Jourova said she expected the social network to cooperate fully with European data protection authorities.(Reporting by Julia Fioretti; Editing by Andrew Roche and David Evans)        Continue reading the main story

        Authorities in the U.S. and the U.K. are bearing down on Facebook and political data-mining firm Cambridge Analytica over allegations the firm stole data from 50 million Facebook users and used it to manipulate elections.There have been numerous demands for investigations and calls for Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to testify. Facebook has sidestepped questions on whether Zuckerberg would appear, saying instead that it's currently focused on conducting its own reviews.___IN THE UNITED KINGDOM:— PARLIAMENT COMMITTEE: The U.K. parliamentary media committee has summoned Zuckerberg to testify. The chairman, Damian Collins, said his panel has repeatedly asked Facebook how it uses data. He said Facebook officials ""have been misleading to the committee."" In a letter to Zuckerberg, Collins wrote, ""It is now time to hear from a senior Facebook executive with the sufficient authority to give an accurate account of this catastrophic failure of process.""— INFORMATION COMMISSIONER: Commissioner Elizabeth Denham is pursuing a warrant to search Cambridge Analytica's servers. Although Cambridge Analytica said it is committed to helping the U.K. investigation, Denham's office said the firm failed to meet a deadline to produce the information requested. Denham said the prime allegation against Cambridge Analytica is that it acquired personal data in an unauthorized way.

___IN THE UNITED STATES:— SENATE: Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, has called Facebook's latest privacy scandal a ""danger signal."" She wants Zuckerberg's assurances that Facebook is prepared to take the lead on security measures that protect people's privacy — or Congress may step in. Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the senior Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, also wants Zuckerberg to testify. But Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr, a Republican from North Carolina, won't commit to asking Zuckerberg to appear. Republicans on the Commerce Committee also have sent letters requesting information from Facebook and Cambridge parent SCL Group.

— HOUSE: Chris Wylie, a former Cambridge Analytica employee who became a whistleblower, has agreed to be interviewed by Democrats on the U.S. House Intelligence Committee. A date has not been set, and it's unclear if Republicans on the panel will attend.— FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION: A dozen consumer-advocacy organizations are pressing the FTC to investigate whether the release of data violated an agreement Facebook signed with the FTC in 2011 offering privacy assurances. Bloomberg News first reported the FTC could already be investigating. The FTC hasn't confirmed the investigation but said it takes ""any allegations of violations of our consent decrees very seriously.""        Continue reading the main story

        NEW YORK —  Facebook ""likes"" can tell a lot about a person. Maybe even enough to fuel a voter-manipulation effort like the one a Trump-affiliated data-mining firm stands accused of — and which Facebook may have enabled.The social network is under fire after The New York Times and The Guardian newspaper reported that former Trump campaign consultant Cambridge Analytica used data, including user likes, inappropriately obtained from roughly 50 million Facebook users to try to influence elections.Monday was a wild roller coaster ride for Facebook, whose shares plunged 7 percent in its worst one-day decline since 2014. Officials in the EU and the U.S. sought answers, while Britain's information commissioner said she will seek a warrant to access Cambridge Analytica's servers because the British firm had been ""uncooperative"" in her investigation. The first casualty of that investigation was an audit of Cambridge that Facebook had announced earlier in the day; the company said it ""stood down"" that effort at the request of British officials.Adding to the turmoil, the New York Times reported that Facebook security chief Alex Stamos will step down by August following clashes over how aggressively Facebook should address its role in spreading disinformation. In a tweet , Stamos said he's still fully engaged at Facebook but that his role has changed.

It would have been quieter had Facebook likes not turned out to be so revealing. Researchers in a 2013 study found that likes on hobbies, interests and other attributes can predict personal attributes such as sexual orientation and political affiliation. Computers analyze such data to look for patterns that might not be obvious, such as a link between a preference for curly fries and higher intelligence.

        Chris Wylie, a Cambridge co-founder who left in 2014, said the firm used such techniques to learn about individuals and create an information cocoon to change their perceptions. In doing so, he said, the firm ""took fake news to the next level.""""This is based on an idea called 'informational dominance,' which is the idea that if you can capture every channel of information around a person and then inject content around them, you can change their perception of what's actually happening,"" Wylie said Monday on NBC's ""Today."" It's not yet clear exactly how the firm might have attempted to do that.Late Friday, Facebook said Cambridge improperly obtained information from 270,000 people who downloaded an app described as a personality test. Those people agreed to share data with the app for research — not for political targeting. And the data included who their Facebook friends were and what they liked — even though those friends hadn't downloaded the app or given explicit consent.Cambridge got limited information on the friends, but machines can use detailed answers from smaller groups to make good inferences on the rest, said Kenneth Sanford of the data science company Dataiku.Cambridge was backed by the conservative billionaire Richard Mercer, and at one point employed Stephen Bannon — later President Donald Trump's campaign chairman and White House adviser — as a vice president. The Trump campaign paid Cambridge roughly $6 million according to federal election records, although officials have more recently played down that work.The type of data mining reportedly used by Cambridge Analytica is fairly common, but is typically used to sell diapers and other products. Netflix, for instance, provides individualized recommendations based on how a person's viewing behaviors fit with what other customers watch.But that common technique can take on an ominous cast if it's connected to possible elections meddling, said Robert Ricci, a marketing director at Blue Fountain Media.

Wylie said Cambridge Analytica aimed to ""explore mental vulnerabilities of people."" He said the firm ""works on creating a web of disinformation online so people start going down the rabbit hole of clicking on blogs, websites etc. that make them think things are happening that may not be.""

Wylie told ""Today"" that while political ads are also targeted at specific voters, the Cambridge effort aimed to make sure people wouldn't know they were getting messages aimed at influencing their views.The Trump campaign has denied using Cambridge's data. The firm itself denies wrongdoing, and says it didn't retain any of the data pulled from Facebook and didn't use it in its 2016 campaign work.Yet Cambridge boasted of its work after another client, Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, won the Iowa caucus in 2016.Cambridge helped differentiate Cruz from similarly minded Republican rivals by identifying automated red light cameras as an issue of importance to residents upset with government intrusion. Potential voters living near the red light cameras were sent direct messages saying Cruz was against their use.Even on mainstay issues such as gun rights, Cambridge CEO Alexander Nix said at the time, the firm used personality types to tailor its messages. For voters who care about tradition, it could push the importance of making sure grandfathers can offer family shooting lessons. For someone identified as introverted, a pitch might have described keeping guns for protection against crime.It's possible that Cambridge tapped other data sources, including what Cruz's campaign app collected. Nix said during the Cruz campaign that it had five or six sources of data on each voter.Facebook declined to provide officials for interview and didn't immediately respond to requests for information beyond its statements Friday and Monday. Cambridge also didn't immediately respond to emailed questions.Facebook makes it easy for advertisers to target users based on nuanced information about them. Facebook's mapping of the ""social graph"" — essentially the web of people's real-life connections — is also invaluable for marketers.

For example, researchers can look at people's clusters of friends and get good insight as to who is important and influential, said Jonathan Albright, research director at the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University. People who bridge different friend networks, for example, can have more influence when they post something, making them prime for targeting.Two-thirds of Americans get at least some of their news on social media, according on Pew Research Center. While people don't exist in a Facebook-only vacuum, it is possible that bogus information users saw on the site could later be reinforced by the ""rabbit hole"" of clicks and conspiracy sites on the broader internet, as Wylie described.___An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated the sum paid by the 2016 Trump campaign to Cambridge Analytica. It was $5.9 million according to federal election records.AP technology reporter Ryan Nakashima contributed to this report from Menlo Park, California.

Before reading the article:Do you wish you had more privacy online? How concerned are you that companies or groups might use your personal data on social media in ways you wouldn’t like?And, if you are concerned, what can people do to protect their online privacy?Now, read the entire article, “Facebook’s Role in Data Misuse Sets Off Storms on Two Continents,” and answer the following questions:1. What is Facebook being accused of, according to the article, and how did Facebook respond on Twitter? How does this report involve President Trump’s 2016 campaign?2. What did Damian Collins, a Conservative lawmaker in Britain who is leading a parliamentary inquiry into fake news and Russian meddling in his country’s referendum to leave the European Union, say he wants Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, to do, and why?3. How did the political data firm Cambridge Analytica obtain data from Facebook users in 2014? What did Cambridge Analytica tell Facebook users it was using the data for, and what information did it not reveal?

Will it make you reconsider how you use social media in any way?

How should Facebook respond to the “backlash about how it protects user data?”The article reports that Maura Healey, the attorney general of Massachusetts, announced that her office would open an investigation, and that two top Congressional Democrats would also call for investigations into the Facebook data leak. What do you think those investigations might reveal, and why?For related Times coverage, see “Alex Stamos, Facebook Data Security Chief, To Leave Amid Outcry,” “Cambridge Analytica, Trump-Tied Political Firm, Offered to Entrap Politicians” and “How Facebook’s Data Sharing Went From Feature to Bug.”        Continue reading the main story

        Authorities in the U.S. and Europe are bearing down on Facebook and political data-mining firm Cambridge Analytica over allegations the firm stole data from 50 million Facebook users and used it to manipulate elections.There have been numerous demands for investigations and calls for Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to testify. Zuckerberg has said he's willing to testify before Congress to answer questions about the privacy scandal. But he suggested other executives might be better qualified to field questions from lawmakers.___IN THE UNITED KINGDOM:— PARLIAMENT COMMITTEE: The U.K. parliamentary media committee has summoned Zuckerberg to testify. The chairman, Damian Collins, said his panel has repeatedly asked Facebook how it uses data. He said Facebook officials ""have been misleading to the committee."" In a letter to Zuckerberg, Collins wrote, ""It is now time to hear from a senior Facebook executive with the sufficient authority to give an accurate account of this catastrophic failure of process.""— INFORMATION COMMISSIONER: Commissioner Elizabeth Denham is pursuing a warrant to search Cambridge Analytica's servers. Although Cambridge Analytica said it is committed to helping the U.K. investigation, Denham's office said the firm failed to meet a deadline to produce the information requested. Denham said the prime allegation against Cambridge Analytica is that it acquired personal data in an unauthorized way.

___IN THE UNITED STATES:— SENATE: The chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee says he's invited Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to testify at a hearing next month on data privacy. Sen. Charles Grassley, an Iowa Republican, says the April 10 hearing will cover how consumer data is collected, retained and distributed for commercial use. Senate Democrats have also been seeking information or Zuckerberg's testimony, while Republicans on the Commerce Committee also sent letters requesting information from Facebook and Cambridge parent SCL Group.

        — HOUSE: Chris Wylie, a former Cambridge Analytica employee who became a whistleblower, has agreed to be interviewed by Democrats on the U.S. House Intelligence Committee. A date has not been set, and it's unclear if Republicans on the panel will attend.— FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION: The agency confirms it will investigation following news reports last week. Tom Pahl, acting director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection, said the U.S. probe would include whether the company engaged in ""unfair acts"" that cause ""substantial injury"" to consumers. Facebook reached a settlement with the FTC in 2011 offering privacy assurances, though the FTC's probe may extend to Facebook's compliance with U.S.-EU principles for transferring data.— INDIVIDUAL STATES: The attorneys general for 37 U.S. states and territories sought details Monday on how Facebook monitored what app developers did with data collected on Facebook users and whether Facebook had safeguards to prevent misuse. They also asked Zuckerberg for an update on how Facebook will allow users to control the privacy of their accounts more easily.        Continue reading the main story

        On the same day Facebook bought ads in U.S. and British newspapers to apologize for the Cambridge Analytica scandal, the social media site faced new questions about collecting phone numbers and text messages from Android devices.The website Ars Technica reported that users who checked data gathered by Facebook on them found that it had years of contact names, telephone numbers, call lengths and text messages.Facebook said Sunday the information is uploaded to secure servers and comes only from Android users who opt-in to allow it. Spokeswomen say the data is not sold or shared with users' friends or outside apps. They say the data is used ""to improve people's experience across Facebook"" by helping to connect with others.The company also says in a website posting that it does not collect the content of text messages or calls. A spokeswoman told the Associated Press that Facebook uses the information to rank contacts in Messenger so they are easier to find, and to suggest people to call.

        The data collection can be turned off in a user's settings, and all previously collected call and text history shared on the app will be deleted, Facebook said.The feature was first introduced on Facebook Messenger in 2015 and added later on Facebook Lite.Messages were left Sunday seeking comment about security from Google officials, who make the Android operating system.Reports of the data collection came as Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg took out ads in multiple U.S. and British Sunday newspapers to apologize for the Cambridge Analytica scandal.

The ads say the social media platform doesn't deserve to hold personal information if it can't protect it.According to the ads, a quiz app built by a Cambridge University researcher leaked Facebook data of millions of people four years ago. Zuckerberg said this was a ""breach of trust"" and that Facebook is taking steps to make sure it doesn't happen again.Facebook's privacy practices have come under fire after Cambridge Analytica, a Trump-affiliated political consulting firm, got data inappropriately. The social media platform's stock value has dropped over $70 billion since the revelations were first published.Among the newspapers with the ads were The New York Times and The Washington Post in the U.S., and The Sunday Times and The Sunday Telegraph in the United Kingdom.The ads said Facebook is limiting the data apps received when users sign in. It's also investigating every app that had access to large amounts of data. ""We expect there are others. And when we find them, we will ban them and tell everyone affected,"" the ads stated.Cambridge Analytica got the data from a researcher who paid 270,000 Facebook users to complete a psychological profile quiz back in 2014. But the quiz gathered information on their friends as well, bringing the total number of people affected to about 50 million.

        MENLO PARK, Calif. —  Facebook has a problem it just can't kick: People keep exploiting it in ways that could sway elections, and in the worst cases even undermine democracy.News reports that Facebook let the Trump-affiliated data mining firm Cambridge Analytica abscond with data from tens of millions of users mark the third time in roughly a year the company appears to have been outfoxed by crafty outsiders in this way.Before the Cambridge imbroglio, there were Russian agents running election-related propaganda campaigns through targeted ads and fake political events. And before the Russians took center stage, there were purveyors of fake news who spread false stories to rile up hyperpartisan audiences and profit from the resulting ad revenue.In the previous cases, Facebook initially downplayed the risks posed by these activities. It only seriously grappled with fake news and Russian influence after sustained criticism from users, experts and politicians. In the case of Cambridge, Facebook says the main problem involved the transfer of data to a third party — not its collection in the first place.

Each new issue has also raised the same enduring questions about Facebook's conflicting priorities — to protect its users, but also to ensure that it can exploit their personal details to fuel its hugely lucrative, and precisely targeted, advertising business.

        Facebook may say its business model is to connect the world, but it's really ""to collect psychosocial data on users and sell that to advertisers."" said Mike Caulfield, a faculty trainer at Washington State University who directs a multi-university effort focused on digital literacy.Late Friday, Facebook announced it was banning Cambridge , an outfit that helped Donald Trump win the White House, saying the company improperly obtained information from 270,000 people who downloaded a purported research app described as a personality test. Facebook first learned of this breach of privacy more than two years ago, but hasn't mentioned it publicly until now.And the company may still be playing down its scope. Christopher Wylie, a former Cambridge employee who served as a key source for detailed investigative reports published Saturday in The New York Times and The Guardian , said the firm was actually able to pull in data from roughly 50 million profiles by extending its tentacles to the unwitting friends of app users. (Facebook has since barred such second-hand data collection by apps.)Wylie said he regrets the role he played in what he called ""a full service propaganda machine."" Cambridge's goal, he told the Guardian in a video interview , was to use the Facebook data to build detailed profiles that could be used to identify and then to target individual voters with personalized political messages calculated to sway their opinions.""It was a grossly unethical experiment,"" Wylie said. ""Because you are playing with an entire country. The psychology of an entire country without their consent or awareness.""

Cambridge has denied wrongdoing and calls Wylie a disgruntled former employee. It acknowledged obtaining user data in violation of Facebook policies, but blamed a middleman contractor for the problem. The company said it never used the data and deleted it all once it learned of the infraction — an assertion contradicted by Wylie and now under investigation by Facebook.Jonathan Albright, research director at the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University, said Facebook badly needs to embrace the transparency it has essentially forced on its users by sharing their habits, likes and dislikes with advertisers. Albright has previously noted cases in which Facebook deleted thousands of posts detailing Russian influence on its service and underreported the audience for Russian posts by failing to mention millions of followers on Instagram, which Facebook owns.Facebook is ""withholding information to the point of negligence,"" he said Saturday. ""How many times can you keep doing that before it gets to the point where you're not going to be able to wrangle your way out?""

The Cambridge imbroglio also revealed what appear to be loopholes in Facebook's privacy assurances, particularly regarding third-party apps. Facebook appears to have no technical way to enforce privacy promises made by app developers, leaving users little choice but to simply trust them.In fact, the enforcement actions outlined in Facebook's statement don't address prevention at all — just ways to respond to violations after they've occurred.On Saturday, Facebook continued to insist that the Cambridge data collection was not a ""data breach"" because ""everyone involved gave their consent"" to share their data. The purported research app followed Facebook's existing privacy rules, no systems were surreptitiously infiltrated and no one stole passwords or sensitive information without permission. (To Facebook, the only real violation was the transfer of information collected for ""research"" to a third party such as Cambridge.)Experts say that argument only makes sense if every user fully understands Facebook's obscure privacy settings, which often default to maximal data sharing.""It's a disgusting abuse of privacy,"" said Larry Ponemon, founder of the privacy research firm Ponemon Institute. ""In general, most of these privacy settings are superficial,"" he said. ""Companies need to do more to make sure commitments are actually met.""___Jesdanun reported from New York.

        DUBLIN —  Facebook's lead regulator in the European Union, the Irish Data Protection Commissioner, is ""following up"" with the U.S. internet giant to ensure its oversight of app developers' use of its data is effective, her office said on Tuesday.Britain is investigating whether Facebook did enough to protect data after a whistleblower said a London-based political consultancy hired by Donald Trump improperly accessed information on 50 million Facebook users to sway public opinion.Facebook, like a number of U.S. multinationals, has its European headquarters in Dublin and the office of Irish Data Protection Commissioner Helen Dixon said she was looking into the matter.""The Irish DPC is following up with Facebook Ireland in relation to what forms of active oversight of app developers and third parties that utilise their platform is in place with a view to ensuring it is effective,"" it said in a statement.

        But it said that issues reported by Britain's Observer newspaper ""affected substantially U.S. Facebook users"" and was already being investigated by the British regulator.Facebook said in a statement that if Cambridge Analytica still held the data it would be a ""grave violation of Facebook's policies."" Cambridge Analytica has denied all the media claims.The Irish government has significantly increased the funding of the DPC in recent years following accusations its regulation system was weak.

In 2011 Austrian privacy activist Max Schrems submitted a complaint to the Irish regulator about the use of Facebook users' friends' data by third-party apps without their direct consent.That complaint was rejected, but the DPC said it recommended in 2012 that Facebook reconsider its policy of allowing the data of friends of Facebook users to be harvested by app-owners.In May 2014, access to friends data was restricted by Facebook in a platform upgrade, the DPC said.Asked on Tuesday about concerns over regulation in Ireland, where U.S. internet multinationals are major employers, Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said the system was ""robust"" and the government would continue to increase the DPC's resources.""I don't think we can be any way complacent about the risks that are posed by people interfering in elections,"" Varadkar said.Schrems told Irish broadcaster RTE on Tuesday that the issue described by a whistleblower in the Observer was exactly what was described in the complaint to the Irish DPC in 2011 and that the regulator ""could probably have prevented"" Cambridge Analytica from securing that data.The DPC did not directly respond when asked if its actions had allowed Cambridge Analytica to harvest data.

        NEW YORK —  Facebook Inc Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg plans to testify before U.S. Congress, a source briefed on the matter said on Tuesday, as he bows to pressure from lawmakers insisting he explain how 50 million users' data ended up in the hands of a political consultancy.Lawmakers in the United States and Europe are demanding to know more about the company's privacy practices after a whistleblower said consultancy Cambridge Analytica improperly accessed data to target U.S. and British voters in close-run elections.Facebook said the company had received invitations to testify before Congress and that they were talking to legislators.Facebook shares closed down 4.9 percent on Tuesday and have fallen almost 18 percent since March 16, when Facebook first acknowledged that user data had been improperly channeled to Cambridge Analytica, which was hired by Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign.

The tech sector is down 5.2 percent for March and on track for its worst month since April 2016. The data breach has raised investor concerns that any failure by big tech companies to protect privacy could deter advertisers and lead to tougher regulation.

        House Energy and Commerce Committee spokeswoman Elena Hernandez said ""The committee is continuing to work with Facebook to determine a day and time for Mr. Zuckerberg to testify"".On the same day, Zuckerberg turned down British lawmakers' invitations to explain to a British parliamentary committee what went wrong.The company said it would instead send one of his deputies, suggesting that Chief Technology Officer Mike Schroepfer or Chief Product Officer Chris Cox had the expertise to answer questions on the complex subject.The head of the committee called Zuckerberg's decision ""astonishing"" and urged him to think again.Christopher Wylie, the whistleblower who once worked at Cambridge Analytica, said on Monday that Canadian company AggregateIQ had developed the software that used the algorithms from the Facebook data to target Republican voters in the 2016 U.S. election.

AggregateIQ did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wylie's remarks. Cambridge Analytica said it had not shared any of the Facebook profile data with AggregateIQ.Cambridge Analytica has said it did not use Facebook data in Trump's campaign, and that it had deleted all Facebook data it obtained from a third-party app in 2014 after learning the information did not adhere to data protection rules.In full-page advertisements in British and U.S. newspapers this week Zuckerberg said the app built by a university researcher ""leaked Facebook data of millions of people in 2014"".He apologized last week for the mistakes the company had made and promised to restrict developers' access to user information as part of a plan to protect privacy.

The U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee said on Monday it had invited Zuckerberg, as well as the CEOs of Alphabet Inc and Twitter Inc to testify at an April 10 hearing on data privacy.The U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee and U.S. Senate Commerce Committee had already formally asked Zuckerberg to appear at a congressional hearing.The U.S. Federal Trade Commission took the unusual step of announcing on Monday that it had opened an investigation into the company - which it generally only does in cases of great public interest - citing media reports that raise what it called ""substantial concerns about the privacy practices of Facebook.""(Writing by Susan Thomas; Editing by James Dalgleish)        Continue reading the main story

        SAN FRANCISCO —  Facebook Inc faced new calls for regulation from within U.S. Congress and was hit with questions about personal data safeguards on Saturday after reports a political consultant gained inappropriate access to 50 million users' data starting in 2014.Facebook disclosed the issue in a blog post on Friday, hours before media reports that conservative-leaning Cambridge Analytica, a data company known for its work on Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, was given access to the data and may not have deleted it.The scrutiny presented a new threat to Facebook's reputation, which was already under attack over Russians' alleged use of Facebook tools to sway American voters before and after the 2016 U.S. elections.""It's clear these platforms can't police themselves,"" Democratic U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar tweeted.""They say 'trust us.' Mark Zuckerberg needs to testify before Senate Judiciary,"" she added, referring to Facebook's CEO and a committee she sits on.

        Facebook insisted the data was misused but not stolen, because users gave permission, sparking a debate about what constitutes a hack that must be disclosed to customers.""The lid is being opened on the black box of Facebook's data practices, and the picture is not pretty,"" said Frank Pasquale, a University of Maryland law professor who has written about Silicon Valley's use of data.Pasquale said Facebook's response that data had not technically been stolen seemed to obfuscate the central issue that data was apparently used in a way contrary to the expectations of users.""It amazes me that they are trying to make this about nomenclature. I guess that's all they have left,"" he said.Democratic U.S. Senator Mark Warner said the episode bolstered the need for new regulations about internet advertising, describing the industry as the ""Wild West.""""Whether it's allowing Russians to purchase political ads, or extensive micro-targeting based on ill-gotten user data, it's clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency,"" he said.With Republicans controlling the Senate's majority, though, it was not clear if Klobuchar and Warner would prevail.

Some 270,000 people allowed use of their data by a researcher, who scraped the data of all their friends as well, a move allowed by Facebook until 2015. The researcher sold the data to Cambridge, which was against Facebook rules, the newspapers said.Cambridge Analytica worked on Trump's 2016 campaign. A Trump campaign official said, though, that it used Republican data sources, not Cambridge Analytica, for its voter information.Facebook, in a series of written statements beginning late on Friday, said its policies had been broken by Cambridge Analytica and researchers and that it was exploring legal action.Cambridge Analytica in turn said it had deleted all the data and that the company supplying it had been responsible for obtaining it.Andrew Bosworth, a Facebook vice president, hinted the company could make more changes to demonstrate it values privacy. ""We must do better and will,"" he wrote on Twitter, adding that ""our business depends on it at every level.""Facebook said it asked for the data to be deleted in 2015 and then relied on written certifications by those involved that they had complied.Nuala O'Connor, president of the Center for Democracy & Technology, an advocacy group in Washington, D.C., said Facebook was relying on the good will of decent people rather than preparing for intentional misuse.Moreover, she found it puzzling that Facebook knew about the abuse in 2015 but did not disclose it until Friday. ""That's a long time,"" she said.

        LONDON —  A scandal engulfing Facebook over the use of its data by political consultants widened on Tuesday when a whistleblower said Canadian company AggregateIQ had developed a program to target Republican voters in the 2016 U.S. election.Christopher Wylie, who previously revealed that consultancy Cambridge Analytica had accessed the data of 50 million Facebook users to build voter profiles on behalf of Donald Trump's campaign, said AggregateIQ (AIQ) had built software called Ripon to profile voters.Wylie was giving evidence to a British parliamentary committee over the scandal, minutes after Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg declined to appear before the legislators to discuss what went wrong.The head of the committee called Zuckerberg's decision ""astonishing"" and urged him to think again.CNN said Zuckerberg had decided to testify before the U.S. Congress.

        ""There's now tangible proof in the public domain that AIQ actually built Ripon, which is the software that utilized the algorithms from the Facebook data,"" Wylie told the British Parliament's Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee.Facebook is facing intense scrutiny after Wylie's revelations about improper use of personal data and the role that could have played in the 2016 U.S. election.Zuckerberg apologized last week for the mistakes Facebook had made and promised tougher steps to restrict third-party access to such information.Ripon, the Wisconsin town where the Republican Party was founded in 1854, was the name given to a tool that let a campaign manage its voter database, target specific voters, conduct canvassing, manage fundraising and carry out surveys.AggregateIQ did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the remarks. The company previously told Reuters that it had never been and is not a part of Cambridge Analytica nor ever entered into a contract with Cambridge Analytica.

Cambridge Analytica said it had not shared any of the Facebook profile data with AggregateIQ.The Canadian federal agency charged with protecting privacy rights of individuals said on Tuesday that it has contacted its counterpart in British Columbia to discuss the provincial office's review of AggregateIQ.ABSOLUTELY ASTONISHINGWith the scandal around Facebook widening, Britain's cross-party media committee had invited Zuckerberg to parliament to explain how personal data had ended up in the hands of  Cambridge Analytica, the London-based political consultancy which was working on the Trump campaign.The company said he had asked one of his deputies to attend the hearing in London, suggesting that Chief Technology Officer Mike Schroepfer or Chief Product Officer Chris Cox had the expertise to answer questions on the complex subject.

        NEW YORK —  MSCI Inc on Tuesday said it is looking into the possibility that Facebook Inc user data was accessed by the consultancy Cambridge Analytica.The stock index provider currently rates Facebook as ""average"" in its environmental, social and corporate governance, or ESG, data, which is used as a template by funds and investors that aim to buy companies with a positive social impact. A spokeswoman said MSCI cannot yet share any impact the review could have on Facebook's ESG rating.The social media company is not currently seen as a high performer on ESG issues relative to its industry peers, MSCI said.An increasingly vocal base of investors who put their money where their values are have raised concerns about Facebook and are reassessing whether they should own one of the market's tech darlings. More than $20 trillion globally is allocated toward ""responsible"" investment strategies in 2016, a figure that grew by a quarter from just two years earlier, according to Global Sustainable Investment Alliance, an advocacy group.

Cambridge Analytica has strongly denied the media claims and said it deleted all Facebook data it obtained from a third-party application in 2014 after learning the information did not adhere to data protection rules.Facebook said on Monday it had hired digital forensics firm Stroz Friedberg to carry out a comprehensive audit of Cambridge Analytica and that the company had agreed to comply and give the forensics firm complete access to its servers and systems.

        LONDON —  A group of whistleblowers on Monday questioned the integrity of Britain's vote to leave the European Union, presenting 50 pages of documents that they say prove the official Brexit campaign group violated election finance rules on the way to winning the 2016 referendum.They allege that the official Vote Leave campaign circumvented spending limits by donating 625,000 pounds ($888,000) to the pro-Brexit student group BeLeave but sending the money directly to campaign consultant AggregateIQ. The firm has long-term links to Cambridge Analytica, the British consultant accused of misusing Facebook data to help Donald Trump win the 2016 U.S. presidential election, the group says.""This not about re-fighting the referendum,"" Chris Wylie, the central figure in the original Cambridge Analytica revelations, told reporters at a packed news conference in London. ""It's about the integrity of the democratic process.""The allegations have been presented to Britain's Electoral Commission and come just days after a prominent Labour Party politician called for a second Brexit referendum once the true costs of leaving the bloc become clear. Britain voted to leave the EU in a June 2016 referendum, with 52 percent of voters supporting Brexit.

        Campaign finance rules limited Vote Leave's spending on the Brexit referendum to 7 million pounds. When Vote Leave got close to that limit during the final weeks of the campaign, it made the donation to BeLeave, said Shahmir Sanni, a volunteer who helped run the grassroots student group.""I know that Vote Leave cheated,"" Sanni told Britain's Channel 4 news. ""I know that people have been lied to and that the referendum wasn't legitimate.""Attorney Tamsin Allen laid out the evidence supporting the claims during a news conference in London, presenting journalists with printouts of electronic message exchanges, photos and a legal opinion presented to Britain's Electoral Commission.The message exchanges show Vote Leave officials overseeing the content of material distributed by BeLeave volunteers, and offering suggestions on how BeLeave workers should respond to questions from the Electoral Commission. One email from a commission investigator discusses how BeLeave should report the Vote Leave donation since it never actually received the money.The whistleblowers also have evidence that AggregateIQ was sending targeted ads on behalf of BeLeave at a time when it was working closely with Vote Leave, Allen said.

""A number of witnesses, including Shahmir Sanni, one of the Vote Leave volunteers, have now come forward with their accounts and produced emails, invoices, photographs and evidence from the internal systems of Vote Leave and BeLeave,"" she said.Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, a leading figure in the Leave campaign, dismissed the campaign finance allegations as ""ludicrous.""Environment Secretary Michael Gove, who was co-chair of the Vote Leave campaign, insisted the referendum result must be respected.

""I respect the motives and understand the feelings of those who voted to remain in the EU,"" he said. ""But 17.4 million opted to leave in a free and fair vote and the result must be respected. It's our job now to work to overcome division.""AggregateIQ, based in Victoria, British Columbia, said it has never been part of Cambridge Analytica and has never signed a contract with the company. But Wylie told the Observer that he was instrumental in the foundation of AggregateIQ, when he was the research director of SCL, the parent company of Cambridge Anayltica. He said they shared underlying technology and worked so closely together that Cambridge Analytica staff often referred to the Canadian firm as a department.But the company said it was 100-percent Canadian owned and operated and was never part of Cambridge Analytica or SCL.""AggregateIQ works in full compliance within all legal and regulatory requirements in all jurisdictions where it operates,"" the company said in a statement. ""It has never knowingly been involved in any illegal activity.

        WASHINGTON —  Facebook said on Sunday it was conducting a ""comprehensive internal and external review"" to determine if the personal data of 50 million users that was reported to be misused by a political consultant still existed.The company said in a statement that it was trying to determine the accuracy of allegations that a researcher gave the firm Cambridge Analytica inappropriately obtained Facebook user data starting in 2014.In the statement from Paul Grewal, a Facebook vice president and deputy general counsel, the company said it was committed to ""vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people's information.""(Reporting by Pete Schroeder; Editing by Peter Cooney)        Continue reading the main story

SAN FRANCISCO — For the past week, Mark Zuckerberg has grappled with a backlash from lawmakers, regulators and users over Facebook’s mishandling of data privacy. He has also had to face another restive group: his own employees.The Facebook chief executive has taken multiple steps over the past few days to communicate with the social network’s 25,000 employees over revelations last week that a British political consulting firm, Cambridge Analytica, had improperly obtained data of 50 million Facebook users.The Silicon Valley company held a staff meeting on Tuesday to answer questions about Cambridge Analytica, featuring one of Facebook’s lawyers, Paul Grewal. On Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Zuckerberg addressed employees directly, according to two Facebook employees who asked not be identified because the proceedings were confidential. Mr. Zuckerberg also spoke with staff on Friday at a regularly scheduled employee meeting, said two people who attended the event.Facebook declined to comment on the meetings.Speaking to Facebook’s employees was a crucial prong of what has become an apology tour of sorts for Mr. Zuckerberg over the Cambridge Analytica fallout. The revelations have raised calls for Mr. Zuckerberg to appear before Congress to explain himself, as well as a #DeleteFacebook movement and other criticism.

Mr. Zuckerberg had stayed silent on the matter for days, until he released a statement on Wednesday vowing that Facebook had to do better and gave several interviews to quell the crisis. That has not stopped pressure from Congress, with bipartisan leaders of the House Energy and Commerce Committee saying on Friday that they had sent a formal request for Mr. Zuckerberg to appear in a hearing over Facebook’s “harvesting and sale of personal information” related to Cambridge Analytica.

        Calming employees was particularly vital because morale had sunk at the company, Facebook employees have said, especially after months of scrutiny over how the social network was used by Russian agents to influence the 2016 presidential election. Keeping workers engaged is crucial in Silicon Valley’s highly competitive job market, where recruiting and retaining talent often is difficult against deep-pocketed rivals.Earlier this week, some Facebook employees had said that colleagues had started looking to transfer from the main social network product to other branches of the company, such as to messaging app WhatsApp and photo-sharing site Instagram, which have been relatively unscathed by the recent scandals.

One Facebook recruiter, who declined to be identified because of a nondisclosure agreement, said there were concerns that top talent might choose other Silicon Valley companies over Facebook.“It’s such a shocking difference for company employees who are used to having esteem for where they work,” said Eric Schiffer, chairman of Reputation Management Consultants, a consulting firm, and who has been speaking with people at Facebook. “Ten years ago, Facebook was the hottest place to go out of college. This year, the best graduates are not necessarily looking at Facebook.”When Mr. Zuckerberg did not appear at the Tuesday staff meeting hosted by the company lawyer, Mr. Grewal, his absence made headlines.When he spoke to workers on Wednesday, Mr. Zuckerberg focused on concrete measures that Facebook was taking following the Cambridge Analytica reports, two employees said. Staff members asked questions about how Mr. Zuckerberg planned to regain user trust, especially in light of the #DeleteFacebook campaign from users, the two employees said.Mr. Zuckerberg said the social network was investigating apps like the third-party quiz app that had obtained access to “large amounts of information” from the social network, which had then been used by Cambridge Analytica. He also said the company would restrict third-party developers’ access and would notify users whose data had been harvested by Cambridge Analytica.

Of the #DeleteFacebook campaign, Mr. Zuckerberg told The New York Times in an interview, “I think it’s a clear signal that this is a major trust issue for people, and I understand that.”Three Facebook employees said morale had improved following the interviews and the internal communications that Mr. Zuckerberg did on Wednesday. One of them said he had avoided a trip home to see his family last weekend because he did not want to answer questions about the company he worked for.On Friday, Facebook’s senior managers promised an open line of communication as the company continued to re-evaluate its privacy and security measures, said two employees.There was a feeling, said one of the people, that Facebook wanted to take aggressive steps to make sure it could regain user trust. And over all, he said, confidence was up.

        WASHINGTON —  Several U.S. Republican lawmakers expressed concern over privacy violations on Sunday after media reports that a political consultancy that worked on President Donald Trump's campaign gained inappropriate access to 50 million Facebook users' data.Republican Senator Marco Rubio said he believed some internet companies have grown too fast to digest their responsibilities and obligations.""So we'll learn more about this in the days to come. But yeah I'm disturbed by that,"" Rubio told NBC's ""Meet the Press.""Senator Rand Paul was asked whether people can trust companies like Facebook in the wake of the report about Cambridge Analytica taking data.

        Facebook disclosed the issue in a blog post on Friday, hours before media reports that conservative-leaning Cambridge Analytica, a data company known for its work on Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, was given access to the data and may not have deleted it.Facebook said in a statement that a Cambridge University psychology professor had lied to the company and violated its policies by passing data to Cambridge Analytica from an app he had developed. It suspended the firm from Facebook.Facebook did not immediately reply when asked on Sunday for a response to the lawmakers' comments. However, in a new statement Sunday, the company said it was conducting a ""comprehensive internal and external review"" to determine if the user data in question still existed.Cambridge Analytica and the professor have denied violating Facebook's terms, according to media reports.

The scrutiny presented a new threat to Facebook's reputation, which was already under attack over Russians' use of Facebook tools to sway American voters before and after the 2016 U.S. elections.Republican Senator Jeff Flake said he had a lot of questions about the data taken from Facebook, including who knew it had been taken and whether it is still being used.""This is a big deal, when you have that amount of data, and the privacy violations there are significant,"" he told CNN's ""State of the Union"" program. ""So the question is who knew it and when did they know it, how long did this go on and what happens to that data now.""Facebook faced new calls for regulation from Democratic senators on Saturday and was hit with questions about personal data safeguards, but it was unclear whether the Republican-controlled Congress would act.

"130","Beware of A.I. in Social Media Advertising","AdvertisementOpinionSupported byOp-Ed ContributorBeware of A.I. in Social Media AdvertisingImageCreditYuichiro Chino/Getty ImagesBy Dipayan GhoshMarch 26, 2018Nine days ago, we learned that Cambridge Analytica, the firm engaged by the Trump campaign to lead its digital strategy leading up to the 2016 United States presidential elections, illegitimately gained access to the Facebook data of more than 50 million users, many of them American voters. This revelation came on the heels of the announcement made last month by the Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller of the indictment of 13 Russians who worked for the Internet Research Agency, a “troll farm” tied to the Kremlin, charging that they wielded fake social media accounts to influence the 2016 presidential elections.But as Facebook, Google, Twitter and like companies now contritely cover their tracks and comply with the government’s requests, they simultaneously remain quiet about a critical trend that promises to subvert the nation’s political integrity yet again if left unaddressed: the systemic integration of artificial intelligence into the same digital marketing technologies that were exploited by both Cambridge Analytica and the Internet Research Agency.According to the F.B.I.’s findings, the tactics used to date by Russia have, technologically speaking, not been particularly sophisticated. Those tactics have included the direct control of fake social media accounts and manual drafting of subversive messages. These were often timed for release with politically charged incidents in the real world — including, for instance, the suicide bombings in Brussels, the declaration of Donald Trump as the Republican nominee and Mr. Trump’s staging of a town hall in New Hampshire, each of which occurred weeks before election night in 2016. Further, according to various experts, Cambridge Analytica’s targeting efforts likely were tame and ineffective.Each step of the digital campaigns seems to have been orchestrated by a human working from a computer terminal. To be sure, we know that the Internet Research Agency’s deception campaigns altogether enjoyed broad reach and were viewed by many Americans; more than 126 million of us may have unwittingly viewed the Russians’ egregious and misleading content on Facebook alone. And if Cambridge Analytica did indeed make use of the rich trove of sensitive data it acquired from Aleksandr Kogan’s firm Global Science Research, Cambridge Analytica’s content too likely reached tens of millions of American voters. But because their digital messaging was largely controlled directly by a bottleneck of human propagators, its spread necessarily was relatively uncoordinated and ad hoc.As the industry increasingly integrates artificial intelligence into digital advertising, however, disinformation operations and legitimate political communications will gradually become concerted, automatic and seamless. The real innovation in digital marketing — and the type of thing that the United States Congress and American voters should be particularly concerned about — is the execution of disinformation that operates at real scale. Where there were once a couple dozen human operators stitching together a few divisive messages during working hours in Moscow to pick at the digital halls of our democracy, there will soon be countless A.I. systems testing and probing a plethora of content on a vast field of social media user audiences that are highly segmented by race, ethnicity, gender, location, socioeconomic class and political leaning. We can expect advisory firms like Cambridge Analytica, the Russians and other participants — not to mention our own political parties themselves — to pounce on this new vector for political messaging and take direct aim at our open political discourse.Despite these myriad risks, industry professionals seem to have turned a blind eye to the oncoming specter of A.I., likely because they are optimistic about its commercial potential. The leading internet firms are offering free A.I. courses for their brightest engineers; are developing plans to integrate A.I. across their leading brands and products; and are staffing up with brilliant philosophers, ethicists and technocrats to deflect nosy regulators and win over the merchants of information. In his interview with The New York Times last week, Mark Zuckerberg even went so far as to describe A.I. as the antidote that will cure the internet of such negative externalities as hate speech and election interference. What internet firms are not transparent about, though, is the degree to which they plan to integrate A.I. into their principal profit-generating engine: digital advertising.Consider the scale and complexity of the advertising ecosystem. Global internet firms like Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat and Google collectively enjoy billions of active users who on average spend more than two hours on these platforms every day. Each user might be shown hundreds or thousands of digital display ads — or “sponsored” content — within that time. People in the industry leverage an intricate web of ad agencies, exchanges, networks, demand-side platforms and supply-side platforms to manage the delivery of those ads around the clock.But if you could remove those people from the equation, you could quietly turn a $100 billion digital ad industry into a $1 trillion persuasion machine.To be clear, algorithms have long been part and parcel of the industry. Organizations like the Russian government and Cambridge Analytica were taking advantage of them simply by virtue of using social media for political communications. But the sharp uptick in industry research and development in A.I. over the past year strongly suggests that this new technology will soon be brought to bear in digital advertising. This will increase the speed of ad mediation, inundating users with content finely tuned to their personal desires. It will abet the seamless and accurate development of “look alike” audiences, enabling advertisers to upload their customer lists and automatically send ads to like-minded people that they do not already know. And it will enable automated contingency-based marketing, allowing clients to programmatically trigger certain kinds of content to be shared in the moments after real world events transpire.For students of disinformation — including the Russians who to date have not even had to leverage such sophisticated web technology to mislead American voters — this new information ecosystem presents a vast land of opportunity. One could imagine that the Internet Research Agency could set up automated, machine learning-informed content-targeting systems so that minutes after North Korea’s leader references a hypothetical ICBM, the Russians send inflammatory A.I.-produced messages and imagery to classes of the American population that A.I. has predicted will be susceptible to disinformation. The scalability of such activity is what makes such tactics especially fearsome.Deep-rooted societal tensions will likely be exacerbated by the irresponsible integration of A.I. into digital advertising services — not to mention, into the ranking and curation of “organic” content on social media news feeds and search results. We’re already seeing this. For example, just a few hours before Senator Marco Rubio took the stage to speak with students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, ill-taught algorithms were responsible for the spread of YouTube videos that mocked and shamed the students.Even in light of the Cambridge Analytica revelations, there is time yet to act. Internet firms should aggressively work to limit disinformation on their platforms by developing algorithms — perhaps driven by A.I., as suggested by Mr. Zuckerberg — that can detect disinformation and flag it for fast human review. Strong one-off actions against widespread disinformation tactics, such as Twitter’s recent move, can also help. They also must be more transparent about their algorithmic software and data practices with researchers, journalists and consumers. Further, the regulatory community must continue its aggressive review of the industry’s practices. The Federal Trade Commission’s announcement of its forthcoming investigation into Facebook’s privacy practices represents excellent progress.In the meantime, the public must not let up. The economic structure of the digital sector has already harmed our society in ways that have been exacerbated by the unchecked collection of individual behavioral data. The revelations about Cambridge Analytica and Russia’s disinformation operations are prime evidence for this — and things could get worse very soon. Politicians and regulators must continue the call for a meaningful privacy law and stronger antitrust enforcement in this country. Nothing less can win us back full control of the state.

        LONDON —  Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg's decision not to answer questions from British lawmakers about a scandal over the firm's data is ""astonishing"", the parliamentary committee chief who invited him to attend said on Tuesday.""Given the extraordinary evidence that we've heard so far today... it is absolutely astonishing that Mark Zuckerberg is not prepared to submit himself to questioning,"" Damian Collins said. Collins, Chair of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee was speaking during a hearing with a whistleblower from political consultancy Cambridge Analytica, the firm which got hold of data of millions of Facebook users.Collins added: ""These are questions of a fundamental importance and concern to Facebook users, as well as to our inquiry as well. We would certainly urge him to think again if he has any care for people that use his company's services.""(Reporting by Alistair Smout; editing by Stephen Addison)        Continue reading the main story

You know, if Congress wants to look into the matter or other agencies want to look into the matter, we welcome that,"" White House Deputy Press Secretary Raj Shah told Fox News Channel when asked if Facebook's head, Mark Zuckerberg, should testify before Congress about the reports that have angered U.S. lawmakers and international regulators alike.""Without knowing the specifics, it's difficult to tell whether an individual should testify but we do support the privacy of American citizens.""(Reporting by Lisa Lambert)        Continue reading the main story

        ROME —  A Rome prosecutor has opened a probe into whether any breaches of Facebook data had occurred in Italy after a Britain-based political consultancy accessed information about 50 million users, a judicial source said on Friday.The country's postal police, which handles cases related to the Internet, is investigating the matter, the source said.Magistrates in Italy can open an investigation without identifying a suspect or specifying a crime. The judicial source said the investigation would look into whether Facebook data was used by third parties to influence Italian elections.Facebook has lost more than $50 billion in market value since allegations this week that Cambridge Analytica improperly accessed data to build profiles on American voters and influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election.(Reporting by Domenico Lusi; Writing by Isla Binnie; Editing by Crispian Balmer)        Continue reading the main story

        LONDON —  Lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic criticized Facebook and its chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, after reports surfaced that another company, Cambridge Analytica, improperly harvested information from 50 million Facebook users.A British lawmaker accused Facebook on Sunday of misleading officials by downplaying the risk of users' data being shared without their consent.Conservative legislator Damian Collins, who heads the British Parliament's media committee, said he would ask Zuckerberg or another Facebook executive to appear before his panel, which is investigating disinformation and ""fake news.""Collins said Facebook has ""consistently understated"" the risk of data leaks and gave misleading answers to the committee.

        Collins also accused the head of the U.K.-based data firm Cambridge Analytica, Alexander Nix, of lying. Nix told the committee last month that his firm had not received data from a researcher accused of obtaining millions of Facebook users' personal information.In Washington, Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat from Minnesota, said on Twitter that Zuckerberg ""needs to testify before Senate Judiciary.""""This is a major breach that must be investigated,"" Klobuchar, a member of the Judiciary Committee, said. ""It's clear these platforms can't police themselves.""Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, echoed Klobuchar's complaint.""This is more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West,"" he said. ""It's clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency.""

Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey said on Twitter that ""Massachusetts residents deserve answers"" and announced that her office will investigate.The officials reacted to reports in The New York Times and The Guardian of London that Cambridge Analytica, which is best known for working on President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign, had improperly obtained Facebook user data and retained it after claiming it had deleted the information.Former Cambridge Analytica employee Chris Wylie said that the company obtained information from 50 million Facebook users, using it to build psychological profiles so voters could be targeted with ads and stories.

Wylie told Britain's Channel 4 news that the company was able to amass a huge database very quickly from an app developed by an academic that vacuumed up data from Facebook users who agreed to fill out a survey, as well as their friends and contacts — a process of which most were unaware.""Imagine I go and ask you: I say, 'Hey, if I give you a dollar, two dollars, could you fill up this survey for me, just do it on this app', and you say, 'Fine,'"" he said. ""I don't just capture what your responses are, I capture all of the information about you from Facebook. But also this app then crawls through your social network and captures all of that data also.""Wylie said that allowed the company to get roughly ""50 million plus"" Facebook records in several months and he criticized Facebook for facilitating the process.""Why Facebook didn't make more inquiries when they started seeing that, you know, tens of millions of records were being pulled this way, I don't know,"" he said.Lawmaker Collins said he would summon Nix to reappear before the Parliament committee.""It seems clear that he has deliberately misled the committee and Parliament by giving false statements,"" Collins said.__AP Business Writer Christopher Rugaber contributed to this story from Washington.

        LONDON —  A whistleblower at the heart of a Facebook data scandal on Monday questioned the result of Britain's 2016 Brexit referendum as his lawyers presented evidence that they said showed the main campaign for leaving the EU had broken the law.With just a year until Britain is due to leave the European Union, two whistleblowers - one from the British political consultancy Cambridge Analytica and one from the Vote Leave group - have alleged that Brexit campaigners funded their campaign illegally.By doing so, they have pulled Brexit into a scandal that has forced Mark Zuckerberg to apologise for how Facebook handled users' data, and raised questions about how Donald Trump's 2016 campaign employed data.Vote Leave officials on Monday denied breaking election rules and said they were facing an attempt to undermine Brexit by smearing their reputations.

        In a legal opinion, Bindmans said there was a prima facie case that Vote Leave broke election spending limits by donating to an allied group known as BeLeave, with which it was working closely.""Can we be confident in the result of the referendum?"" said whistleblower Christopher Wylie, formerly of Cambridge Analytica. ""This is not refighting the referendum. This is about the integrity of the democratic process.""

""If this country is on the path of an irreversible decision, we really should be confident that the basis of that decision came from a free and fair vote - and what this evidence does is it calls into question whether it was free and fair.""Reuters was unable to verify the allegations made against Vote Leave. Matthew Elliott, its former CEO, said the allegations were wrong.""Vote Leave did not break the law,"" Elliott told Reuters. ""Voters can be confident this was a free and fair referendum.""Elliott said the Electoral Commission had twice looked into Vote Leave's relationship with BeLeave and had given it a clean bill of health both times. He said he was confident that the third investigation would produce the same result.""The basis of all this is an attempt by people on the 'Remain' campaign to call into doubt the result of the EU referendum,"" Elliott said.(Reporting by Alistair Smout, writing by Guy Faulconbridge; Editing by Kevin Liffey)        Continue reading the main story

        NEW YORK —  U.S. regulators and state attorneys general are increasing pressure on Facebook as they probe whether the company's data-collection practices have hurt the people who use its services.The Federal Trade Commission confirmed news reports on Monday that it was investigating the company. Separately, the attorneys general for 37 U.S. states and territories sought details Monday on how Facebook monitored what app developers did with data collected on Facebook users and whether Facebook had safeguards to prevent misuse.Facebook's privacy practices have come under fire after revelations that a Trump-affiliated consulting firm, Cambridge Analytica, got data on millions of Facebook users. That included information on friends of people who had downloaded a psychological quiz app, even though those friends hadn't given explicit consent to sharing.Facebook is also facing questions about reports that it collected years of contact names, telephone numbers, call lengths and information about text messages from Android users. Facebook says the data is used ""to improve people's experience across Facebook"" by helping to connect with others. But the company did not spell out exactly what it used the data for or why it needed it.

European officials also have also been investigating or seeking more information. Germany's justice minister said Monday that she wants closer oversight of companies such as Facebook after a meeting with its executives about the abuse of users' data. Last week, a U.K. parliamentary media committee summoned CEO Mark Zuckerberg to testify about how Facebook uses data, while U.K. Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham is investigating how Cambridge Analytica got the data.

        In addition, the state's attorney of Cook County in Illinois has sued Facebook and Cambridge Analytica for consumer fraud after revelations that the latter obtained data on millions of Facebook users. Facebook has not commented on the lawsuit.The recent troubles follow Facebook's most difficult year yet, as the company dealt with fake news, ""filter bubbles"" that lead to increasing polarization, and congressional hearings over Russian agents' alleged use of social media to meddle with the 2016 presidential elections.In January, Zuckerberg set fixing Facebook as his personal challenge for 2018. Nearly three months in, it's a taller order than ever.Tom Pahl, acting director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection, said the U.S. probe would include whether the company engaged in ""unfair acts"" that cause ""substantial injury"" to consumers. Facebook reached a settlement with the FTC in 2011 offering privacy assurances, though the FTC's probe may extend to Facebook's compliance with U.S.-EU principles for transferring data.Facebook said in a statement on Monday that the company remains ""strongly committed"" to protecting people's information and that it welcomes the opportunity to answer the FTC's questions.

Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, believes Facebook was in violation of the 2011 settlement in letting Cambridge Analytica harvest data on friends of Facebook users. He called the investigation ""good news.""""This is what Facebook was doing 10 years ago that people objected to, what the FTC should have stopped in 2011,"" Rotenberg said. ""It makes zero sense that when a person downloads their apps, they have the ability to transfer the data of their friends.""Although Zuckerberg talked about changes in 2014 that would have prevented this, Rotenberg said it should have been banned already under the 2011 consent decree. He said the FTC had dropped the ball in failing to enforce that.

Meanwhile, state attorneys general asked Zuckerberg for an update on how Facebook will allow users to control the privacy of their accounts more easily.""Facebook has made promises about users' privacy in the past, and we need to know that users can trust Facebook,"" they wrote. ""With the information we have now, our trust has been broken.""In a statement, Facebook's vice president for state and local public policy, Will Castleberry, said the attorneys general ""have raised important questions and we appreciate their interest. Our internal review of the situation continues and we look forward to responding.""Facebook's stock, which already took a big hit last week, fell Monday after the FTC announcement but recovered by the end of the day. With Monday's close at $160.06, the stock is down almost 14 percent since March 16, when the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke.___Selsky reported from Salem, Oregon.

        NEW YORK —  Wondering why Facebook seems to be taking baby steps to address the biggest scandal in its history? Stronger safeguards on user data might damage Facebook's core business of using what it knows about you to sell ads that target your interests.Facebook is proposing only narrow countermeasures that address the specifics of the furor over Cambridge Analytica. That's the data mining firm that worked for Donald Trump's campaign, and now stands accused of lifting data from some 50 million Facebook users for the purpose of influencing voters.Those measures, announced Wednesday by CEO Mark Zuckerberg, mostly involve new limits on what Facebook apps can do with the user data they collect. One such errant app was central to the Cambridge Analytica debacle.But those steps don't get at what many outsiders see as bigger problems at Facebook: its rampant data collection from users, its embrace of political ads that target individuals and small demographic groups with precision, and its apparent inability to end malicious use of its service by governments, shady corporations and criminal elements.

""They're being very deft and creating the illusion of trust,"" said Scott Galloway, a New York University professor of marketing. But by focusing on the mechanics of how apps work on its service, he said, Facebook is failing to take meaningful action to ensure it's not ""weaponized"" by scammers, manipulators and other nefarious types.

        Ultimately, Facebook is a data-collection company and without user data, it would wither and die. But how much data it sucks in, and what it does with it, is a question of major public importance — one that touches on the health of democracy itself, privacy advocates say.It's just not a question that Facebook seems to want to address.Facebook made $40 billion in advertising revenue last year, and that's expected to rise 22 percent this year to $49 billion, according to research firm eMarketer. Wall Street analysts who follow Facebook don't seem worried yet, despite the sharp drop in the company's stock this week. That's because analysts don't expect the company to have to change the way it does business.Like its closest rival Google, Facebook offers companies an unparalleled way to target people for advertising, right down to their most granular details. It can, for instance, single out users who live in Kansas and have listed Bernie Sanders and same-sex marriage as their interests — which is exactly what some Russian-linked ads did as part of a propaganda campaign during the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign.Apps — everything from dumb personality quizzes to games (remember ""FarmVille?"") — have been able to harvest user information since 2007, when Facebook opened its service to outside developers. Facebook has since restricted what types of data apps could access, notably in 2014, but as the Cambridge Analytica debacle shows, loopholes remained.

In the wake of the Cambridge Analytica outcry, Facebook is once again cracking down — but solely on apps. Its new restrictions limit what data apps can access and will cut them off from your information if you don't use them for three months. Facebook will also conduct its own audits of apps that appear to suck in large quantities of data, although it has said nothing about allowing independent audits, leaving users no alternative but to trust that Facebook itself has their interests at heart.One better solution, says Marc Rotenberg of the Electronic Privacy Information Center: Make apps alert users whenever data transfers are taking place. That would let people decide whether or not to keep them.Zuckerberg apologized for the debacle during a CNN interview Wednesday, but stopped short of endorsing broad privacy legislation and instead said only that he would support the ""right"" kind of rules. For instance, he said, it might be OK to require online political ads to disclose who paid for them — but then talked up Facebook's own voluntary efforts instead of endorsing an existing bill that would do just that.Jeffrey Chester, executive director for the consumer-privacy group Center for Digital Democracy, said Facebook is blaming app developers and outside firms like Cambridge Analytica ""instead of saying, 'we need to really look at cleaning house.'""

Many users have had an uneasy relationship with the company, largely due to its series of privacy scandals over the years that seem to be growing more serious. Back in 2007, for example, Facebook launched a service called Beacon, which tracked what users did on other websites and published it on people's news feeds, often without the users' knowledge. Facebook was sued over Beacon and shut it down in 2009.The current scandal has fueled a nascent #deletefacebook movement. While there's no sign of a Facebook exodus so far, the possibility presents yet another threat to the company.""Until this debacle, I had no idea,"" said Pat Hager of Bismarck, North Dakota, who is considering deactivating Facebook. ""I wouldn't have a problem with them putting ads on the side or in the posts like they do, but the data sharing that was going on behind our backs feels sneaky and devious.""___AP Technology Writer Mae Anderson contributed to this story.

        SAN FRANCISCO —  Facebook Inc Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg apologised on Wednesday for mistakes his company made in how it handled data belonging to 50 million of its users, and promised tougher steps to restrict developers' access to such information.The world's largest social media network is facing growing government scrutiny in Europe and the United States. This follows allegations by a whistleblower that British political consultancy Cambridge Analytica improperly accessed users' information to build profiles on American voters that were later used to help elect U.S. President Donald Trump in 2016.""This was a major breach of trust. I'm really sorry this happened. We have a basic responsibility to protect people's data,"" Zuckerberg told CNN, breaking a public silence since the scandal erupted at the weekend.Zuckerberg said in a post on Facebook the company ""made mistakes, there's more to do, and we need to step up and do it.""

        His plans did not represent a big reduction of advertisers' ability to use Facebook data, which is the company's lifeblood.European governments expressed dissatisfaction with Facebook's response and said the scandal showed the need for strong regulation.""It shouldn't be for a company to decide what is the appropriate balance between privacy and innovation and use of data. Those rules should be set by society as a whole and so by parliament,"" British minister for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, Matt Hancock, told BBC Radio. ""The big tech companies need to abide by the law and we're strengthening the law.""Germany's justice minister Katarina Barley demanded that Facebook executives explain to her whether the site's 30 million German users had been affected.Zuckerberg said he was open to additional government regulation and happy to testify before the U.S. Congress if he was the right person.""I'm not sure we shouldn't be regulated,"" he told CNN. ""I actually think the question is more what is the right regulation rather than yes or no, should it be regulated? ... People should know who is buying the ads that they see on Facebook.""Zuckerberg said Facebook was committed to stopping interference in the U.S. midterm election in November and elections in India and Brazil.

The company has lost nearly $46 billion of its stock market value over the past three days on investors' fears that any failure by big tech firms to protect personal data could deter advertisers and users and invite tougher regulation.Zuckerberg told the New York Times in an interview published on Wednesday he had not seen a ""meaningful number of people"" deleting their accounts over the scandal.Facebook representatives met U.S. congressional staff on Wednesday and planned to continue meetings on Capitol Hill on Thursday. Facebook was unable to answer many questions, two aides who attended the briefing said.Zuckerberg told the website Recode that fixes to protect users' data would cost ""many millions of dollars."" (http://bit.ly/2IJbYJS)The whistleblower who launched the scandal, Christopher Wylie, formerly of Cambridge Analytica, said on Twitter he had accepted invitations to testify before U.S. and UK lawmakers.'SCAPEGOAT'On Tuesday, the board of Cambridge Analytica suspended its Chief Executive Alexander Nix, who was caught in a secret recording boasting that his company played a decisive role in Trump's victory.Psychologist Aleksandr Kogan, who provided the data, dismissed on Wednesday Cambridge Analytica's assertions that the information was ""incredibly accurate"".Kogan, who gathered the data by running a survey app on Facebook, also said he was being made a scapegoat by the social media firm and Cambridge Analytica. Both companies have blamed Kogan for alleged data misuse.

About 300,000 Facebook users responded to Kogan's quiz, but that gave the researcher access to those people's Facebook friends as well, who had not agreed to share information, producing details on 50 million users.Facebook has said it subsequently made changes that prevent people from sharing data about friends and maintains that no breach occurred because the original users gave permission. Critics say that it essentially was a breach because data of unsuspecting friends was taken.Analysts say the incident may reduce user engagement with Facebook, lessening its clout with advertisers. Three Wall Street brokerages cut their price targets.(Reporting by David Ingram; Additional reporting by Dustin Volz and David Shepardson in Washington and Kate Holton in London; Writing by Susan Thomas; Editing by Bill Rigby, Lisa Shumaker, Paul Tait and David Stamp)        Continue reading the main story

        MOSCOW/FRANKFURT —  The psychologist at the centre of a scandal over the misuse of millions of Facebook users' personal data worked with Russian researchers on a study of toxic personality traits.Aleksandr Kogan advised a team at St Petersburg State University that was exploring whether psychopathy, narcissism and machiavellianism - dubbed the 'dark triad' by psychologists - were linked to abusive online behaviour, said Yanina Ledovaya, senior lecturer at the university's department of psychology.""We wanted to detect (internet) trolls in order to improve in some way the lives of people suffering from trolling,"" Ledovaya told Reuters.Kogan, a lecturer at Britain's Cambridge University who also goes by the married name of Spectre, has come under fire for passing data culled via a Facebook personality quiz to political consultancy Cambridge Analytica.

The test was taken by a few hundred thousand people but the app on which it ran also collected details about all of their Facebook 'friends' without their knowledge or consent.        Continue reading the main story

        That data was then used in a targeted digital ad campaign in support of Donald Trump's successful run for the U.S. presidency, Cambridge Analytica's CEO Alexander Nix told an undercover reporter from Britain's Channel Four news.Nix was suspended on Tuesday in a spiralling scandal over how the data came into his company's hands, in violation of Facebook's own rules. The saga has wiped nearly $50 billion (£35.53 billion) off the social network's market value.Kogan did not respond to an emailed request to comment on his work in St Petersburg, but told the BBC on Wednesday he was being made a scapegoat by both Facebook and Cambridge Analytica. The latter firm has no link to the university.NO DATA LEAKLedovaya said Kogan had advised the St Petersburg team on the project - which was funded by a university grant - between 2015 and 2017, visiting rarely and mainly interacting from abroad.The team built a Facebook app using a 61-question survey for Russian-speaking users that sought to determine to what degree they had the 'dark triad' traits.The app collected answers, as well as the public data of respondents, after securing their consent. Separately, the researchers analysed the text of users' public Facebook posts.Ledovaya said the data gathered was not passed to anyone outside the five-member research team - nor was it shared with Kogan.

Research into personality traits viewed as malevolent goes back at least to Sigmund Freud, the Viennese pioneer of psychiatry who identified narcissism - or excessive self-love.Machiavellianism, named after the Italian diplomat and writer of the Renaissance era, represents manipulative behaviour, while psychopathy manifests a lack of empathy.Ledovaya said one goal of the project was to ascertain the mental wellbeing of the respondents and, as appropriate, offer free counselling.RUSSIAN CONNECTIONThe emergence of Kogan's St Petersburg connection comes as relations between Moscow and the West plumb new lows. Kogan, a U.S. citizen, was born in the former-Soviet republic of Moldova but moved to the United States as a child, Britain's Guardian newspaper said.U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller has indicted 13 Russian individuals and three Russian companies for criminal and espionage conspiracy to tamper with the U.S. presidential campaign.One line of inquiry being pursued by Mueller is the suspected use of targeted Facebook messages by Russian groups - including the St Petersburg-based Internet Research Bureau.The St Petersburg State University research team has nothing to do with the Internet Research Bureau, said Ledovaya.""I know the people involved in the research project very well - they are the last people I can imagine taking part somehow in such an activity,"" said Vladimir Volkhonsky, who worked at the psychology faculty until 2011.

Cambridge University said Kogan had correctly sought the permission of the head of the psychology department to do the work with St Petersburg.""It was understood that this work and any associated grants would be in a private capacity, separate to his work at the university,"" it said in a statement.(Writing by Douglas Busvine; editing by John Stonestreet)        Continue reading the main story

        (Reuters) - DZ Bank was the third Wall Street brokerage this week to make a rare cut in price targets for Facebook Inc on Wednesday as the social network's shares slid for a third day in response to a row over data use by Cambridge Analytica.The brokerage cut its target for the California-based firm by $20 to $210, still way above the current share price of $165 but adding to signs that Wall Street analysts are waking up to the risks to the company.A 1.6 percent fall in Facebook shares in premarket trading brought the losses in the company's market value this week to $57 billion, or 10.5 percent - a shock for a company that has risen more than 550 percent in value in the past five years.The suspended chief executive of Cambridge Analytica said in a secretly recorded video broadcast on Tuesday that his UK-based political consultancy's online campaign played a decisive role in U.S. President Donald Trump's 2016 election victory.

There are mixed views, however, on whether an aggressive regulatory response will materialize.So far, U.S. and European lawmakers have demanded an explanation of how Cambridge Analytica gained access to user data in 2014 and why Facebook failed to inform its users, raising broader industry questions about consumer privacy.

        LONDON —  A former Facebook operations manager told a British parliamentary committee on Wednesday that data harvesting of member profiles by outside software developers was once routine and that the company took years to clamp down on the practice.Sandy Parakilas, who was in charge of policing Facebook's data handling procedures in 2011 and 2012, shed fresh light on business practices that are alleged to have enabled Cambridge Analytica to gain unauthorised access to the personal data of tens of millions of U.S. voters.The social networking giant has been rocked this week after a whistleblower said Cambridge Analytica, which U.S. President Donald Trump hired for his 2016 election campaign, improperly accessed information on Facebook users to build detailed profiles on American voters.""There was very little detection or enforcement,"" Parakilas said in testimony via videolink before the House of Common's Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee. ""During my 16 months (at Facebook), I don't remember a single physical audit of a developer"" who was storing users' data from the social network.

Parakilas highlighted vast potential abuses of a little-understood feature known as ""friend permissions"", which enabled software developers to connect their apps up to the friends of users, and even the friends of friends, the so-called ""social graph"" at the heart of Facebook's network of connections.

        ""You are likely talking about tens of thousands of apps that got 'friend permissions' and some of those apps had tens - it was huge - or hundreds of millions of users, so there was a vast (amount) of data that passed out the door,"" Parakilas said.Facebook turned off the friend permissions feature in 2015.Asked by a parliamentary committee member whether there were incidents where this data-sharing feature was misused, Parakilas said: ""There may well have been. However, Facebook did not investigate deeply enough to determine exactly.""

Facebook declined to comment directly on the testimony of the ex-employee. In announcing the suspension of Cambridge Analytica and related researchers from Facebook late last week, it said it now requires app developers to justify any data they collect and how they are going to use it: ""In the past five years, we have made significant improvements in our ability to detect and prevent violations by app developers.""Parakilas, who now works as a product manager at Uber, said he had warned senior executives at Facebook. He said in a Guardian interview this week that he left in frustration over the company's failure to exercise more oversight on privacy issues.One committee member pointedly asked whether Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's founder and chief executive, was aware of the issue. Parakilas said he did not know first-hand, but he added: ""I don't think it was a secret that this was a problem.""""It was well understood both internally and externally that there were risks with respect to the way the Facebook platform was handling data,"" he said.(Reporting by Kate Holton and Paul Sandle; Writing by Eric Auchard; Editing by Hugh Lawson)        Continue reading the main story

        BEIJING —  Executives from Apple Inc and IBM Corp have called for more oversight on how personal data is used following the Facebook Inc breach that saw roughly 50 million users' data misused by consultancy Cambridge Analytica.Speaking at the three-day China Development Forum in Beijing, Apple chief Tim Cook said ""well-crafted"" regulation was required, while IBM Corp chief Virginia Rometty said users should have more agency over their own data.""It's clear to me that something, some large profound change is needed,"" said Apple chief Tim Cook on Saturday.""I'm personally not a big fan of regulation because sometimes regulation can have unexpected consequences to it, however I think this certain situation is so dire, and has become so large, that probably some well-crafted regulation is necessary,"" said Cook, who co-chaired the event this year.

        SALEM, Ore. —  Oregon's attorney general says she is reviewing whether to launch an investigation of Facebook, including whether it violated a state law that protects online customers' private information.Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum told The Associated Press that she and several other state attorneys general are drafting a letter to Facebook, asking about a leak of Facebook customers' data without their knowledge or consent.""We're just full of unanswered questions at this point, and whether or not it's going to blossom into a full-scale investigation is still somewhat up for grabs,"" Rosenblum said in a telephone interview late Thursday.Others are also looking into Facebook:— Overseas, a British parliamentary committee has summoned CEO Mark Zuckerberg to testify, Israel says it is launching an investigation into Facebook, and Germany's justice minister says she is calling in Facebook's European leadership to explain the scandal.

        — New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir Grewal said his office is investigating how personal information came into the possession of Cambridge Analytica. Connecticut's attorney general sent Zuckerberg a letter demanding answers.Cambridge Analytica, a data mining firm that worked for Donald Trump's campaign, is accused of lifting data from some 50 million Facebook users to influence voters. Former Cambridge Analytica employee-turned-whistleblower Christopher Wylie says the firm sought Facebook information to build psychological profiles on a large portion of the U.S. electorate. It amassed the database with the help of academic Aleksander Kogan, who developed a Facebook app called ""This is Your Digital Life"" that appeared to be a personality test, Wylie said.That app vacuumed up information from users who gave the app permission to access their accounts — as well as additional data from tens of millions of their Facebook friends.Cambridge Analytica has denied wrongdoing. Kogan said the data firm approached him for the project and assured him that everything he did was legal.Rosenblum credited Will Castleberry, a Facebook vice president for state and local public policy, for reaching out to her on Thursday, but added that tough questions need to be answered.

She said questions being prepared for the letter include how did Facebook monitor what the developers did with the data and did Facebook have protective safeguards, including audits, to ensure developers were not misusing Facebook user data.""They've known about this for years and they didn't notify any of their users, which really concerns me,"" Rosenblum said. ""What we're trying to do is figure out ... how to keep this from happening in the future.""In an email to AP on Friday, Castleberry said: ""We appreciate Attorney General Rosenblum's interest and will be in touch with her office as we continue our review of the situation.""

Zuckerberg apologized Wednesday during a CNN interview but stopped short of endorsing broad privacy legislation.Rosenblum said her office is looking at whether misuse of Facebook users' data violated a new Oregon law that makes it an unlawful trade practice for a business to collect, use or dispose of a consumer's information in a manner inconsistent with the business's own privacy policy as published on its website.Rosenblum, who had championed the bill that was passed overwhelmingly by the Legislature last year, said Oregon is among the first states, if not the first, to pass such a law. She noted that much of the activity under scrutiny took place before the law took effect, on Jan. 1, but was confident that it would cover continued misuse of data.""Facebook is just an unbelievably big platform,"" Rosenblum told AP. ""They have many opportunities to influence people ... and that's why it's so important for them at the front end to be properly monitoring the developers who take advantage of — and have access to — the data of the users.""___This story has been corrected to reflect Rosenblum spoke to The Associated Press on Thursday.___        Continue reading the main story

        (Reuters) - Facebook Inc will be removed from the Australia-based BetaShares Global Sustainability Leaders Exchange Traded Fund (ETHI) due to recent ""controversies"", its Responsible Investment Committee (RIC) said on Friday.""The company has in recent times been the subject of a number of controversies and reputational issues,"" the committee said in a statement https://www.betashares.com.au/files/ETHI/MEDIA-STATEMENT-ETHI-Removal-of-Facebook_March2018.pdf.The world's largest social media network, with more than 2 billion monthly active users, is under scrutiny following allegations that British political consultancy Cambridge Analytica improperly accessed users' data and helped influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election.Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg apologized on Wednesday, five days after the scandal broke, and promised to restrict developers' access to such information.

        WASHINGTON —  Republican Senator John Kennedy has joined his Democratic colleague Amy Klobuchar in calling on Facebook Inc Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg to testify before Congress following reports that a political consultancy gained inappropriate access to data on millions of Facebook users.In a joint letter, Kennedy and Klobuchar asked Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley to hold a hearing with Zuckerberg and the chief executives of Alphabet Inc's Google and Twitter Inc, reflecting mounting bipartisan concern in Washington about how the companies share personal user data.""Facebook, Google, and Twitter have amassed unprecedented amounts of personal data and use this data when selling advertising, including political advertisements,"" the senators wrote. ""The lack of oversight on how data is stored and how political advertisements are sold raises concerns about the integrity of American elections as well as privacy rights."" The letter came after reports this weekend that Cambridge Analytica, a political consultancy that worked on President Donald Trump’s campaign, gained inappropriate access to data on 50 million Facebook use.(Reporting by Dustin Volz; Editing by Nick Zieminski)        Continue reading the main story

        LONDON —  Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is promising to do a better job protecting user data following reports that a political consultant misused the personal information of millions of the company's subscribers. The fact is, European regulators are already forcing him to do so.A similar data breach in the future could make Facebook liable for fines of more than $1.6 billion under the European Union's new General Data Protection Regulation, which will be enforced from May 25. The rules, approved two years ago, also make it easier for consumers to give and withdraw consent for the use of their data and apply to any company that uses the data of EU residents, no matter where it is based.The law is the latest attempt by EU regulators to rein in mostly American tech giants who they blame for avoiding tax, stifling competition and encroaching on privacy rights. European analysts say GDPR is the most important change in data privacy regulation in a generation as they try to catch up with all the technological advances since 1995, when the last comprehensive European rules were put in place. The impact is likely to be felt across the Atlantic as well.""For those of us who hold out no hope that our government will stand up for our rights, we are grateful to Europe,"" said Siva Vaidhyanathan, a professor at the University of Virginia who studies technology and intellectual property. ""I have great hopes that GDPR will serve as a model for ensuring that citizens have dignity and autonomy in the digital economy. I wish we had the forethought to stand up for the citizen's rights in 1998 (the start of Google), but I'll settle for 2018.""

The U.S. has generally taken a light touch approach to regulating internet companies, with concerns about stifling the technology-fed economic boom derailing President Barack Obama's 2012 proposal for a privacy bill of rights. But Europe has been more aggressive.        Continue reading the main story

        EU authorities have in recent years taken aim at Google's dominance among internet search engines and demanded back taxes from Apple and Amazon. The European Court of Justice in 2014 recognized ""the right to be forgotten,"" allowing people to demand search engines remove information about them if they can prove there's no compelling reason for it to remain.Now data protection is in the crosshairs of the 28-nation bloc, where history has made the right to privacy a fundamental guarantee. Nazi Germany's use of personal information to target Jews hasn't been forgotten, and the new Eastern European members have even fresher memories of spying and eavesdropping by their former communist governments.In today's world, digital commerce companies collect information on every website users visit and every video they like. This data is the lifeblood of social media sites that give users free access to their services in exchange for the right to use that intelligence to attract advertisers.But the Facebook scandal shows it can also be used for other purposes.A whistleblower this month alleged that Cambridge Analytica improperly harvested information from over 50 million Facebook accounts to help Donald Trump win the 2016 presidential election. News reports have focused on the relationship between Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix, former Trump strategist Steve Bannon and billionaire computer scientist Robert Mercer, who bankrolled the operation.Cambridge Analytica says none of the Facebook data was used in the Trump campaign. Facebook is investigating.""The regulation is trying to balance the power between ourselves as individuals and organizations that use that data for a whole variety of services,"" said David Reed, knowledge and strategy director at DataIQ, a London-based firm that provides research on data issues.The EU's new rules expand the reach of regulations to cover any company that processes the data of people living in the bloc, regardless of where the company is based. Earlier rules were ambiguous on this point, and international companies took advantage of that to skirt some regulation, the EU says.

The EU legislation also demands that consent forms are written in plain language anyone can understand. No more legalese across pages and pages of terms and conditions that few people read before clicking ""I Agree."" The regulations also require that consent must be as easy to withdraw as it is to give.To ensure compliance, there's the potential for big fines. Under GDPR, organizations face fines of up to 20 million euros ($25 million) or 4 percent of annual global turnover — whichever is greater — for the most serious violations.Facebook reported $40.65 billion in revenue last year. That means a serious violation could cost the company as much as $1.63 billion.Even though GDPR doesn't legally protect the data of people outside the EU, analysts expect many companies to apply the rules worldwide. Smaller firms are likely to decide it's too expensive to run multiple compliance systems, though bigger firms like Facebook and Google may still decide to ""bracket off"" European operations, Vaidhyanathan said.Sarah T. Roberts, a professor of information studies at UCLA, says the EU is formulating the rules of engagement, rather than allowing internet companies to dictate. While U.S.-based platforms were created in the image of Silicon Valley, that type of bravado and no-holds barred capitalism doesn't go down well in Europe.""Despite claims that cyberspace is not fettered to planet Earth, that is not true,"" she said.Facebook, for one, has taken notice, setting aside a page of its website to explain what the company is doing to comply with GDPR. ""We've built tools to help people manage their data and understand their choices with respect to how we use their personal data,"" it says.But GDPR is not a panacea that will ensure everyone's data is protected. Some analysts suggest the next step should be to ensure that everyone owns their own data and can sell it in exchange for services.Pressure is building for increased regulation in the U.S., where members of Congress have called on Zuckerberg to testify about the Cambridge Analytica scandal.The alleged conspiracy has captured the public imagination, focusing worldwide attention on data protection, Vaidhyanathan said.

        (Reuters) - Facebook Inc said on Wednesday it would end its partnerships with several large data brokers who help advertisers target people on the social network, a step that follows a scandal over how Facebook handles personal information.The world's largest social media company is under pressure to improve its handling of data after disclosing that information about 50 million Facebook users wrongly ended up in the hands of political consultancy Cambridge Analytica.Facebook adjusted the privacy settings on its service on Wednesday, giving users control over their personal information in fewer taps.Facebook has for years given advertisers the option of targeting their ads based on data collected by companies such as Acxiom Corp and Experian PLC.

        ""While this is common industry practice, we believe this step, winding down over the next six months, will help improve people's privacy on Facebook,"" Graham Mudd, a Facebook product marketing director, said in a statement.Shares in Acxiom traded down more than 10 percent to $25 after Facebook's announcement after the bell. Shares in other data brokers were largely unchanged. A representative for Acxiom could not immediately be reached for comment.Facebook declined to comment on how the change could affect its ad revenue.Advertisers would still be able to use third-party data services to measure how well their ads performed by examining purchasing data, Facebook said.Facebook's website lists nine third-party data providers that it has worked with, including Acxiom, Experian, Oracle Data Cloud, TransUnion and WPP PLC.None of the companies could immediately be reached for comment.Facebook on Wednesday also put all its privacy settings on one page and made it easier to stop third-party apps from using personal information. Privacy settings had previously been spread over at least 20 screens, Facebook said.Facebook said in a blog post it had been working on the updates for some time but sped things up to appease users' anger over how the company uses data and as lawmakers around the globe call for regulation.Facebook's shares closed up 0.5 percent at $153.03 on Wednesday. They are still down more than 17 percent since March 16, when Facebook first acknowledged that user data had been improperly channeled in 2014 via a third-party app to Cambridge Analytica, which was later hired by Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign.

The data leak has raised investor concerns that any failure by big tech companies to protect privacy could deter advertisers, who are Facebook's lifeblood, and lead to tougher regulation.

SCRUTINY FROM LAWMAKERSFacebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg has repeatedly apologized for the mistakes the company made and has promised to crack down on abuse of the Facebook platform and restrict developers' access to user information.There is a new Facebook page - called Access Your Information - where users can see what they have shared and manage it.""The biggest difference is ease of access in settings, which fulfills Mark Zuckerberg's promise to make the privacy process and permissions more transparent to users,"" Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter said.It was uncertain whether the changes will satisfy lawmakers.They were announced ahead of a stringent European Union data law which comes into force in May. It requires companies to give people a ""right to portability"" - to take their data with them - and imposes fines of up to 4 percent of global revenue for companies breaking the law.Lawmakers in the United States and Britain are still clamoring for Zuckerberg himself to explain how users' data ended up in the hands of Cambridge Analytica.He plans to testify before Congress, a source briefed on the matter said on Tuesday. Facebook has said it has received invitations to testify and that it is talking to legislators.Zuckerberg and the CEOs of Alphabet Inc and Twitter Inc have been invited to testify at an April 10 hearing on data privacy. The U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee and U.S. Senate Commerce Committee have also asked Zuckerberg to appear at a hearing.The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has opened an investigation into Facebook, and attorneys representing 37 states are also pressing Zuckerberg to explain what happened.(Reporting by David Ingram and Julia Fioretti; Additional reporting by Laharee Chatterjee and Arjun Panchadar; Editing by James Dalgleish and Cynthia Osterman)        Continue reading the main story

Facebook said it would roll out a centralized system for its users to control their privacy and security settings in response to an outcry over the way it has handled personal data.The system, which will be introduced to Facebook users globally over the coming weeks, will allow people to change their privacy and security settings from one place rather than having to go to roughly 20 separate sections across the social media platform.From the new page, users can control the personal information the social network keeps on them, such as their political preferences or interests, and download and review a file of data Facebook has collected about them. Facebook also will clarify what types of apps people are currently using and what permissions those apps have to gather their information.Photo
    
            
        Facebook is rolling out a new centralized page for people to view and control their privacy and security settings.
                    Facebook began developing the centralized system last year but sped it up after revelations that a British political consulting firm, Cambridge Analytica, improperly harvested the information of 50 million users of the social network. The amount of data Cambridge Analytica obtained about Facebook users reawakened fears over how much information the social network has gathered about people, leading to a #DeleteFacebook movement and other criticism.

“The last week showed how much more work we need to do to enforce our policies, and to help people understand how Facebook works and the choices they have over their data,” Erin Egan, Facebook’s chief privacy officer, and Ashlie Beringer, a Facebook deputy general counsel, said in a statement announcing the new system. “We’ve heard loud and clear that privacy settings and other important tools are too hard to find, and that we must do more to keep people informed.”        Continue reading the main story

        The Cambridge Analytica scandal has plunged Facebook into its worst crisis in years, with regulators and lawmakers in the United States and Britain demanding answers about how the social network deals with data privacy. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, has agreed to appear in front of lawmakers on Capitol Hill next month, people familiar with the decision have said.Last week, Mr. Zuckerberg said in a statement that Facebook had to do better with user data and promised to roll out products that give users more control over their information and privacy settings.Video


    
    Why Leaving Facebook Doesn’t Always Mean Quitting

        
            
                In the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, in which data from over 50 million Facebook profiles was secretly scraped and mined for voter insights, many Facebook users have decided to delete their accounts — but untangling yourself from a site like Facebook is not as easy as pressing “delete.”

    “One of our biggest responsibilities is to protect data,” he told The New York Times last week. “Whenever there’s an issue where someone’s data gets passed to someone who the rules of the system shouldn’t have allowed it to, that’s rightfully a big issue and deserves to be a big uproar.Late Wednesday, Facebook also said that it was halting its practice of allowing advertisers to target ads using information from third-party data brokers. These are business-to-business companies that can collect a vast range of details about individual consumers such as their shopping habits, health concerns, income range and preferred credit card.The social network had previously allowed advertisers to use consumer details from data brokers like Experian, Acxiom and Oracle’s Datalogix unit to help target ads to Facebook users. But Facebook said it was now mothballing that option, called “Partner Categories.””We want to let advertisers know that we will be shutting down Partner Categories,” Graham Mudd, a product marketing director at Facebook, said in a statement.

“This product enables third-party data providers to offer their targeting directly on Facebook,” he added. “While this is common industry practice, we believe this step, winding down over the next six months, will help improve people’s privacy on Facebook.”

In 2012, the Federal Trade Commission opened an inquiry into data brokers and subsequently recommended that Congress consider enacting a law “to make data broker practices more visible to consumers and to give consumers greater control over the immense amounts of personal information about them collected and shared by data brokers.”How much of a difference these actions may make to Facebook’s data privacy practices was unclear. Some privacy advocates noted, for instance, that the company’s new centralized privacy and security settings page has been tried in the past.“The platform made similar promises many times before,” said Zeynep Tufekci, an associate professor at the University of North Carolina who studies how technology affects society. She pointed out that in 2010, Mr. Zuckerberg said in The Washington Post that Facebook users needed simpler controls over their privacy and had promised then that Facebook would “add privacy controls that are much simpler to use.”Yet eight years later, the same concerns have resurfaced, Ms. Tufekci said.“The past decade shows that user concerns over privacy appear to have little teeth on changing how the platform behaves, aside from a recycling of contrite statements and promises to do better from its C.E.O.,” she said.

        NEW YORK —  Some 60 companies including such leading brands as Subway, Sprint and the NFL are joining forces to help each other follow you around online.Adobe, a company better known for Photoshop and PDF files, says the new Device Co-op initiative it is organizing will help companies offer more personalized experiences and make ads less annoying by filtering out products and services you have already bought or will never buy. Under the initiative, Adobe can tell you're the same person on a home PC, a work laptop, a phone and a tablet by analyzing past sign-ins with member companies.The initiative comes amid heightened privacy sensitivities after reports that Facebook allowed a political consulting firm, Cambridge Analytica, to harvest data on millions of Facebook users to influence elections. Facebook also has been criticized for collecting call and text logs from phones running Google's Android system.Adobe's initiative underscores the role data plays in helping companies make money. Many of the initial uses are for better ad targeting.

The company timed Wednesday's announcement to a digital marketing conference it is hosting this week in Las Vegas. Adobe executives said they believed their initiative offers strong privacy safeguards and weren't worried about a backlash in light of the Facebook scandal.

Adobe says no personal data is being exchanged among participating companies, which also include Allstate, Lenovo, Intel, Barnes & Noble, Subaru and the Food Network. Adobe says the program links about 300 million consumers across nearly 2 billion devices in the U.S. and Canada.The program would let Sprint, for instance, know that Bob is already a customer when he visits from a new device. Bob wouldn't get a promotion to switch from another carrier, but might get instead a phone upgrade offer. Or if Mary has declared herself a Giants fan on the NFL's app, she might see ads with Giants banners when visiting NFL.com from a laptop for the first time.All this might feel creepy, but such cross-device tracking is already commonly done by matching attributes such as devices that from the same internet location, or IP address. Consumers typically have little control over it.Adobe says it will give consumers a chance to opt out of such tracking. And it's breaking industry practices in a few ways. Adobe says it will honor opt-out requests for all participating companies and for all devices at once. It's more typical for such setups to require people do so one by one. All companies in the initiative are listed on Adobe's website, a break from some companies' practice of referring only to unspecified partners.""We're doing everything we can not letting brands hide themselves,"" Ahuja said.But in taking an opt-out approach, which is common in the industry, Adobe assumes that users consent. And it places the burden on consumers to learn about this initiative and to figure out how they can opt out of it.        Continue reading the main story

Breitbart News is taking a step into the live events business.Following the lead of other media companies seeking fresh sources of revenue, the right-wing news and opinion site is set to host its first-ever town hall in suburban New Orleans next month, a panel on privacy and technology with the commentator Ann Coulter and Peter Schweizer, the author of “Clinton Cash.”It’s an experiment for a site that has lately been confronting declining web traffic and turbulence in its top ranks. Stephen K. Bannon, the site’s longtime executive chairman, was forced out in January. Its page views last month were down by nearly half from a year earlier, according to the data-tracking firm comScore, though Breitbart disputes the figure.The Louisiana event is “the latest evolution in how to consume Breitbart content,” said Alexander Marlow, the site’s editor in chief.By branching into public forums, the site is taking a cue from one of its perennial foes: the mainstream media. News outlets like Vanity Fair, The Washington Post and The New York Times have long sponsored conferences and speaking events.

The Breitbart event is to be held on April 5 at Andrea’s, an Italian restaurant in Metairie, La. The topic — the gatekeeping power of Facebook and other online platforms — coincides with a broader conservative offensive against Big Tech. Breitbart is one of several right-wing sites that have accused Facebook, Google and Twitter of suppressing right-wing voices, claims that the tech companies have denied.

Mr. Schweizer, who collaborated with Mr. Bannon on his investigations into Hillary Clinton, is finishing a documentary about the role of tech companies in filtering the news. Another scheduled guest, Robert Epstein, a former editor of Psychology Today, is expected to be featured in Mr. Schweizer’s film.Breitbart was a champion of Donald J. Trump’s presidential campaign, which Mr. Bannon eventually joined. The site has been denounced as misogynist, racist and xenophobic, and its writers routinely flog the establishment media: Last year, its reporters worked to undercut reporting by The Washington Post about misconduct by Roy Moore, the Republican Senate candidate in Alabama.Mr. Bannon’s ouster, from the White House and then from Breitbart, cut into the site’s cachet. But Breitbart is still among the top-ranked sites on Facebook, and several of its journalists were treated as celebrities at last month’s Conservative Political Action Conference.Facebook’s handling of its users’ data has come under scrutiny in part because of a scandal involving Cambridge Analytica, a company that worked on the Trump campaign and was co-founded by Mr. Bannon. Facebook has banned the company from its platform, saying it misused personal data from Facebook that was provided to it.Mr. Marlow said he knew little about Mr. Bannon’s role in the company, though he defended Cambridge Analytica as engaging in the same kind of data-driven electioneering that left-leaning groups have done in the past.

        SAN FRANCISCO/LONDON —  Opinion polls published on Sunday in the United States and Germany indicated that a majority of the public were losing trust in Facebook over privacy, as the firm ran advertisements in British and U.S. newspapers apologizing to users.Fewer than half of Americans trust Facebook to obey U.S. privacy laws, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Sunday, while a survey published by Bild am Sonntag, Germany’s largest-selling Sunday paper, found 60 percent of Germans fear that Facebook and other social networks are having a negative impact on democracy.Facebook founder and chief executive Mark Zuckerberg apologized for ""a breach of trust"" in advertisements placed in papers including the Observer in Britain and the New York Times, Washington Post and Wall Street Journal.""We have a responsibility to protect your information. If we can't, we don't deserve it,"" said the advertisement, which appeared in plain text on a white background with a tiny Facebook logo.

The German poll published by Bild was conducted by Kantar EMNID, a unit of global advertising holding company WPP, using representative polling methods, the firm said. Overall, only 33 percent found social media had a positive effect on democracy, against 60 percent who believed the opposite.It is too early to say if distrust will cause people to step back from Facebook, eMarketer analyst Debra Williamson said in an interview. Customers of banks or other industries do not necessarily quit after losing faith, she said.""It's psychologically harder to let go of a platform like Facebook that's become pretty well ingrained into people's lives,"" she said.Data supplied to Reuters by the Israeli firm SimilarWeb, which measures global online audiences, indicated that Facebook usage in major markets and worldwide remained steady over the past week.""Desktop, mobile and app usage has remained steady and well within the expected range,"" said Gitit Greenberg, SimilarWeb's director of market insights.

        WASHINGTON/LONDON —  Facebook Inc came under further pressure from lawmakers, investors, advertisers and users on Thursday, the day after Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg admitted the social media network made mistakes in letting 50 million users' data get into the hands of political consultancy Cambridge Analytica.U.S. lawmakers demanded Zuckerberg personally testify in Washington to explain his company's actions.Meanwhile, advertisers Mozilla and Commerzbank suspended ads on the service and the hashtag #DeleteFacebook remained popular online, although it was hard to tell how many users are abandoning Facebook.In light of those concerns, investors continued to sell off Facebook shares, although not at the pace of earlier in the week. They closed on Thursday at $164.89, down 2.7 percent. The S&P 500 Index was down 2.5 percent on the day. Facebook shares closed at $185.09 on Friday.

        Five days after the scandal broke, Zuckerberg apologised on Wednesday for mistakes his company made and promised to restrict developers' access to user information as part of a plan to protect privacy.On Thursday, Facebook executives were still saying sorry.""We know this is an issue of trust. We know this is a critical moment for our company, for the service we provide,"" Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg said in an interview broadcast on CNBC.Zuckerberg's apology and promises were not enough to ease political pressure on the world's largest social media company.""It shouldn't be for a company to decide what is the appropriate balance between privacy and innovation and use of data. Those rules should be set by society as a whole and so by parliament,"" British minister for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, Matt Hancock, told BBC Radio.Zuckerberg's media rounds did little to satisfy Washington lawmakers in either political party who have demanded this week that the 33-year-old billionaire testify before Congress.The Republican chairman and top Democrat of the U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee said they will in coming days formally ask Zuckerberg to testify.The request came a day after company executives briefed committee aides for nearly two hours and left with a list of at least 60 questions they were unable to answer, two aides said.

Facebook said it had no comment beyond what Zuckerberg had already said.Executives also briefed another House committee on Thursday, and while they answered questions about Cambridge Analytica they were unprepared to address broader questions about Facebook's privacy policies, according to a staffer who was present.REPUTATIONAL COSTSWall Street analysts expressed relief that there were no signs so far of a fundamental shift in the company's advertising-driven revenue model, but some said there would be  costs to shore up its reputation.Facebook, with more than 2 billion monthly active users, made almost all its $40.6 billion in revenue last year from advertising.Sandberg said Facebook's priority was restoring users' trust, even if that meant accepting regulation of the data that is central to its ad business, and she said the company was ""massively ramping hiring.""Several analysts cut price targets. Technology stocks have fallen along with Facebook this week as investors worried about tighter scrutiny of global platforms like Alphabet's Google, Twitter and Snapchat.Analysts said Zuckerberg's promises to investigate thousands of apps, and to give members a tool that lets them turn off access, would not substantially reduce advertisers' ability to use Facebook data - the company's lifeblood.Nevertheless, open-source browser and app developer Mozilla said it was ""pressing pause"" on its Facebook advertising after the revelations prompted it to take a closer look at the site's default privacy settings.

""We found that its current default settings leave access open to a lot of data – particularly with respect to settings for third-party apps,"" Mozilla said in a blog post.British advertising group ISBA, which represents thousands of brands, threatened to withdraw ads if investigations show data has been misused.""We think this issue is more likely to snowball than recede and that advertisers are reaching a tipping point at which spending on not only Facebook and other online platforms, is re-evaluated,"" brokerage Liberum said in a note.But Sharon Rowlands, president of USA Today Network Marketing Solutions, said it was unlikely a flood of brands would stop advertising on Facebook because of its powerful targeting tools.""The challenge is that the platform performs,"" Rowlands said. (Additional reporting by David Shepardson in Washington, Jessica Toonkel in New York, Munsif Vengattil in Bangalore, Paul Sandle in London and David Ingram in San Francisco; Writing by Susan Thomas, Editing by Nick Zieminski)        Continue reading the main story

        WASHINGTON —  The leaders of a key House committee declared Thursday that Facebook officials failed to answers questions about a privacy scandal involving a Trump-connected data-mining company, and they want CEO Mark Zuckerberg to testify before the panel.Reps. Greg Walden of Oregon and Frank Pallone of New Jersey said in a brief statement that the ""latest revelations regarding Facebook's use and security of user data raise many serious consumer protection concerns.""Representatives from Facebook, who weren't named, briefed the committee's staff Wednesday, according to Walden and Pallone. But a spokeswoman for the committee said the session left many unanswered questions about how Facebook and third-party developers use and protect consumer data on the social media network.Walden is chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee and Pallone is the panel's top ranking Democrat. Their statement comes a day after Zuckerberg said during an interview on CNN that he would be ""happy"" to testify before Congress, but only if he was the right person to do that. He said there might be other Facebook officials better positioned to appear, depending on what Congress wanted to know.

Walden and Pallone said that as Facebook's top executive, Zuckerberg is indeed the ""right witness to provide answers to the American people."" They said they would work with Facebook and Zuckerberg to set a date and time for a hearing in the near future.        Continue reading the main story

        Their call represents the first official request from a congressional oversight committee for Zuckerberg's appearance amid demands by lawmakers that Facebook explain reports that Cambridge Analytica harvested the data of more than 50 million Facebook users in order to sway elections.The company, funded in part by Trump supporter and billionaire financier Robert Mercer, paired its vault of consumer data with voter information. The Trump campaign paid the firm nearly $6 million during the 2016 election, although it has since distanced itself. Other Republican clients of Cambridge Analytica included Sen. Ted Cruz's failed presidential campaign and Ben Carson, the famed neurosurgeon who also ran unsuccessfully for president in 2016.The data was gathered through a personality test app called ""This Is Your Digital Life"" that was downloaded by fewer than 200,000 people. But participants unknowingly gave researchers access to the profiles of their Facebook friends, allowing them to collect data from millions more users.

Republicans on the Senate Commerce Committee sent Zuckerberg a letter Monday that said the possibility that Facebook has not been transparent with consumers is troubling. They asked for responses by next week to a series of questions, including whether Facebook is aware of any other instances in which a third-party app developer used or shared Facebook user data improperly.It's far from certain what action, if any, the GOP-led Congress and the Trump administration might take against Facebook, but the company will almost certainly oppose any efforts to regulate it or the technology business sector more broadly.As do most large corporations, Facebook has assembled a potent lobbying operation to advance its interests in Washington. The company spent just over $13 million on lobbying in 2017, with the bulk of the money spent on an in-house lobbying team that's stocked with former Republican and Democratic political aides, according to disclosure records filed with the House and Senate.The company sought to influence an array of matters that ranged from potential changes to government surveillance programs to corporate tax issues. One of the team's newer members, Sandra Luff, was Attorney General Jeff Sessions' national security adviser when he served in the Senate.Facebook also employs a small army of outside lobbyists. Among them is Harbinger Strategies, which earned $240,000 last year and deployed four former Capitol Hill staffers to promote Facebook's interests as lawmakers debated the new tax law, cyber security and online advertising issues.___        Continue reading the main story

        SAN FRANCISCO/LONDON —  Opinion polls published on Sunday in the United States and Germany cast doubt over the level of trust people have in Facebook over privacy, as the firm ran advertisements in British and U.S. newspapers apologizing to users.Fewer than half of Americans trust Facebook to obey U.S. privacy laws, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Sunday, while a survey published by Bild am Sonntag, Germany’s largest-selling Sunday paper, found 60 percent of Germans fear that Facebook and other social networks are having a negative impact on democracy.Facebook founder and chief executive Mark Zuckerberg apologized for ""a breach of trust"" in advertisements placed in papers including the Observer in Britain and the New York Times, Washington Post and Wall Street Journal.""We have a responsibility to protect your information. If we can't, we don't deserve it,"" said the advertisement, which appeared in plain text on a white background with a tiny Facebook logo.

        This follows allegations that the British consultancy Cambridge Analytica improperly gained access to users' information to build profiles of American voters that were later used to help elect U.S. President Donald Trump in 2016.U.S. Senator Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said in an interview on NBC’s Meet the Press"" on Sunday that Facebook had not been ""fully forthcoming"" over how Cambridge Analytica had used Facebook data.Warner repeated calls for Zuckerberg to testify in person before U.S. lawmakers, saying Facebook and other internet companies had been reluctant to confront “the dark underbelly of social media” and how it can be manipulated.""BREACH OF TRUST""Zuckerberg acknowledged that an app built by a university researcher had ""leaked Facebook data of millions of people in 2014"".""This was a breach of trust, and I'm sorry we didn't do more at the time,"" Zuckerberg said, reiterating an apology first made last week in U.S. television interviews.

The German poll published by Bild was conducted by Kantar EMNID, a unit of global advertising holding company WPP, using representative polling methods, the firm said. Overall, only 33 percent found social media had a positive effect on democracy, against 60 percent who believed the opposite.It is too early to say if distrust will cause people to step back from Facebook, eMarketer analyst Debra Williamson said in an interview. Customers of banks or other industries do not necessarily quit after losing faith, she said.""It's psychologically harder to let go of a platform like Facebook that's become pretty well ingrained into people's lives,"" she said.Data supplied to Reuters by the Israeli firm SimilarWeb, which measures global online audiences, indicated that Facebook usage in major markets and worldwide remained steady over the past week.""Desktop, mobile and app usage has remained steady and well within the expected range,"" said Gitit Greenberg, SimilarWeb's director of market insights. ""It is important to separate frustration from actual tangible impacts to Facebook usage.""(Additional reporting by William James in London, Dustin Volz in Washington D.C. and Chris Kahn in New Editing by Kevin Liffey)        Continue reading the main story

        (Reuters) - A U.S. judge has ordered Facebook Inc to let her review documents it has refused to give the Internal Revenue Service as that agency probes whether the social media company used an Irish unit to slash billions of dollars from its tax bill.In an order on Tuesday night, U.S. Magistrate Judge Laurel Beeler in San Francisco said she may review up to 15 of the 153 disputed documents, which Facebook believes are privileged or otherwise confidential. The government may select the documents for her to review.According to the government, most of the documents concern a decision by Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg and other Facebook executives to set up an international headquarters in Dublin, Ireland, which occurred in 2010, and the transfer of assets such as worldwide user bases and online platforms there.Facebook was warned by the IRS in July 2016 that the probe could boost its U.S. tax bill by $3 billion to $5 billion, plus interest and penalties, for tax years beginning in 2010. It said last month it has set aside adequate amounts for the probe.

The Menlo Park, California-based company declined to comment on Wednesday.Beeler issued her order amid an unrelated worldwide outcry over Facebook's privacy practices, including the harvesting of user data by the London-based Cambridge Analytica research firm that worked on Donald Trump's 2016 U.S. presidential campaign.

        WASHINGTON —  The U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee said on Monday it had invited the chief executive officers of Facebook Inc, Alphabet Inc and Twitter Inc to testify at an April 10 hearing on data privacy.The hearing follows allegations that Cambridge Analytica, a British political consultancy, gained inappropriate access to data on 50 million Facebook users, prompting the Federal Trade Commission to launch an investigation.Senator Charles Grassley, the committee's chairman, said he invited Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg ""to testify at the hearing to discuss Facebook’s past and future policies regarding the protection and monitoring of consumer data.""Facebook is facing pressure from advertisers as the social network struggles with government scrutiny following the allegations. Zuckerberg last week apologized for mistakes that Facebook made in how it handled data belonging to 50 million of its users.

""The hearing will broadly cover privacy standards for the collection, retention and dissemination of consumer data for commercial use."" Grassley said. ""It will also examine how such data may be misused or improperly transferred and what steps companies like Facebook can take to better protect personal information of users and ensure more transparency in the process.""Last week, the House of Representatives Energy and Commerce Committee formally invited Zuckerberg to testify and the Senate Commerce Committee also invited him to appear. Neither committee has set a date for a hearing.Facebook executives spent Wednesday and Thursday on Capitol Hill briefing congressional committee staffers. Zuckerberg said last week he would be willing to testify if he is the right person at the company to speak to lawmakers.(Reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Paul Simao and Leslie Adler)        Continue reading the main story

Stamos was persuaded to stay through August to oversee the transition of his duties because company executives thought his exit would look bad, it said, citing current and former employees.Facebook's reputation is already under attack over Russia's alleged use of Facebook tools to sway U.S. voters with divisive and false news posts before and after the 2016 election.The company is under fresh scrutiny after media reports that political consultancy Cambridge Analytica harvested private information from more than 50 million Facebook users in developing techniques to support President Donald Trump's 2016 election campaign.(Reporting by Sangameswaran S in Bengaluru and Joseph Menn in San Francisco; Editing by Richard Chang and Cynthia Osterman)        Continue reading the main story

        GENEVA —  The scandal over data privacy that is causing a headache for Facebook Inc shows just one aspect of the huge task of preparing the world for e-commerce, the United Nations trade and development agency UNCTAD said on Wednesday.Facebook has faced a global outcry and its shares have slid in value after a whistleblower said data from millions of users was improperly harvested by consultancy Cambridge Analytica to target U.S. and British voters.""The current debate about Facebook and data privacy vividly illustrates that most countries are ill-prepared for the digital economy,"" UNCTAD Secretary-General Mukhisa Kituyi said in a statement.Data privacy is just one of many boxes that national regulators need to tick if they hope to get a handle on e-commerce, UNCTAD's head of internet and computer technology analysis Torbjörn Fredriksson told a news conference.

        ""Then you look at trade logistics, especially to try to address what we call the tsunami of parcels, when people start ordering from online platforms instead of going to the retail shop that has bought everything in bulk,"" he said.In developing countries, internet purchases are still mainly paid for with cash on delivery, and central banks and finance ministries need to help ensure access to online payment systems, Fredriksson added.But most developing countries are still unclear about whose job it is to coordinate e-commerce, he said.

Without online payments, local firms would struggle to export on international e-commerce platforms such as Amazon and Alibaba, while the flood of imports risks creating a trade imbalance.""There is some concern that ... there is a risk of concentration of markets among the big platforms,"" Fredriksson said, adding that UNCTAD was working on ways to address the problem.Although rich countries are thinking about how they need to adapt, poorer countries are largely flying blind, with no data for example on e-commerce circumventing national trade rules, which could help the traffic in counterfeit goods.""There are concerns about jobs that may be lost, taxation, customs revenue, there's a whole range of issues that are challenges more than opportunities perhaps,"" Fredriksson said.""Governments are increasingly looking at it, but whether they are looking at it enough is another issue.""(Reporting by Tom Miles; Editing by Catherine Evans)        Continue reading the main story

        SAN FRANCISCO —  Big internet companies and small software developers alike are likely to face scrutiny over how they share customer information in the wake of the scandal involving Facebook Inc and the British election consulting firm Cambridge Analytica.Lawmakers in the United States and the EU have called for probes into how Facebook allowed Cambridge Analytica to access data on 50 million users and use it to help the election campaign of President Donald Trump. Facebook shares have fallen 8.5 percent this week as investors fear the incident will lead to new regulation.The scrutiny and the risk of regulatory action could affect Alphabet Inc's Google, Twitter Inc, Uber Technologies Inc, Microsoft Corp's LinkedIn and the many others that make their user data available to outside developers.The interconnections between platforms such as Facebook and Google and third-party services sit at the core of the contemporary internet, enabling people to quickly share articles to Facebook from news websites and log into shopping apps using their Google account.

But the Facebook case has turned the application programming interfaces, or APIs, that enable such data sharing, into a new front in the escalating battle between lawmakers and tech companies over the monitoring and securing of their vast platforms. Threat of sanctions has already prodded companies into better policing of inappropriate commentary on their services.        Continue reading the main story

        ""All companies are going to need to do a lot more than just laissez faire policy to manage third-party data access moving forward,"" said Jason Costa, who helped run APIs at Pinterest Inc, Twitter and Google and now works at GGV Capital. ""The days of (the) 'we're just a platform and can't be held responsible for how users use it' line that many companies use, is no longer going to be tenable.""APIs have raised privacy concerns since they emerged around 2005, but their adoption and impact has grown rapidly as companies move data online and look for ways to make it more useful.Uber, for example, in 2016 enabled apps that provided tax and lending services to import driver paystubs. The company did not respond to a request for comment on its monitoring and auditing practices.The economic dynamic behind APIs is simple: software developers create new tools that benefit big tech companies' users, and in return they gain instant access to a large number of consumers.The big platforms say they have built in protection, such as human reviews and automated scanning tools to detect abuse by partners.But software experts say policies are toothless because auditing is lax; Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, under intense public pressure, said Wednesday the company would now perform audits of the information it shared with partners before it tightened rules in 2014.Dartmouth University engineering professor Geoffrey Parker, who has assigned students to develop apps based on APIs, said automated policing methods will detect spam-like apps and brazen efforts to steal data. It is much more difficult to enforce bans on storing or mashing together information, or acting against users' interest, he said.

Some companies added safeguards in the last several years. Facebook stopped allowing developers access to information on its users' friends. But compliance audits were minimal, a former employee said on the condition of anonymity.

Twitter and LinkedIn limited free public access.For paid deals, LinkedIn said ""partners are rigorously vetted and regularly declined."" The company added that it regularly monitors API usage and takes ""swift action when we see or hear of any abuse of our terms.""Software developers acknowledged they often do not even read the terms of use for APIs. Rule-breakers can fly under the radar and amass significant information, said Andres Blank, chief executive of recruiting software maker Scout.""It's hard to police if the alarms aren't being sounded,"" said Blank, who has worked with APIs from LinkedIn and Google.Alex Moore, chief executive of Baydin Inc, which develops Boomerang, an app that can send emails on time-delay, said Microsoft scrutinized his services when the companies partnered on a new feature. But he was not aware of any auditing after it launched.Google recently asked whether Boomerang could access less information, but that was a rare ""poke,"" Moore said.""There's going to be things people took for granted about data sharing that come to light,"" he said.Google declined to comment. Microsoft did not respond to a request to comment.Clamping down could limit the supply of innovative tools built on data sharing. But some providers, including Royal Bank of Canada, which announced an API this week, have gone a step further to only allow access to vetted partners.Paul Nerger, senior vice president at Developerprogram.com, which helps companies such as Cisco Systems Inc manage APIs, said clients have limited the number of partners so that software can be tested ""to make sure they are not illegally harvesting"" data.

Startups are taking heed too. Affectiva, which last year released an API for identifying consumers' emotional states from speech samples, said that it would audit partners as its program grows.Gabi Zijderveld, the company's chief marketing officer and head of product strategy, said, though, ""we inevitably need regulation and legislation on ethical and transparent use of data.""(Reporting by Paresh Dave; Additional reporting by David Ingram; Editing by Jonathan Weber and Neil Fullick)        Continue reading the main story

        SINGAPORE —  Global tech giants including Facebook and Twitter on Thursday expressed concern about a possible Singapore plan to bring in a new law to tackle the threat of fake news, saying sufficient rules are already in place.Officials of Facebook, Twitter and Google attended a parliamentary hearing on how to counter the threat that Singapore said it was particularly vulnerable to due to its size, its role as a global financial hub and its ethnic and religious mix.They were among 79 people asked to speak in parliament over the eight days set for the hearing.The wealthy city state is among the countries looking to introduce legislation, so far unspecified, to rein in fake news, a trend that has stirred concern that such laws could be used to exert government control over the media.""We do not believe that legislation is the best approach to addressing the issue,"" Alvin Tan, Facebook's head of public policy for Southeast Asia, said in a written submission.

Expressing the view that social media networks were not capable of regulating themselves, Singapore's law minister, K Shanmugam, questioned Facebook official Simon Milner over how ""one of the world's most competent firms"" could have breached users' trust.""Right now, it doesn't feel like it,"" Milner, the firm's Asia policy chief, responded. He conceded failure to be upfront about the breach of user data, saying, ""We had a moral obligation to do it (notify our users).""He added, ""As I understand it, there was not a legal obligation.""Milner questioned the premise that a legal framework could be used to decide whether information was fake news, however.""How do you define ... what is a deliberate online falsehood and what is not? We are skeptical about that.""Microblogging site Twitter also shared concerns about Singapore's plans.""No single company, governmental or non-governmental actor, should be the arbiter of truth,"" said Kathleen Reen, Twitter's director of Public Policy for Asia Pacific.(Reporting by Fathin Ungku; Editing by Jack Kim and Clarence Fernandez)        Continue reading the main story

        BERLIN —  Germany's justice minister said on Thursday she had asked to speak to Facebook executives to find out whether the social media site's 30 million users in the country were affected by a scandal involving the handling of personal data.The world's largest social media network is facing government scrutiny in Europe and the United States about a whistleblower's allegations that London-based consultancy Cambridge Analytica improperly accessed user information to build profiles on American voters that were later used to help elect U.S. President Donald Trump in 2016.Katarina Barley said it must be possible for users of social media sites to specify whether they are happy for their data to be used in certain ways, rather than just giving them the option to tick ""yes"" or not be able to use the service.""I demand clarification on whether German users and accounts are affected and what Facebook plans to do to prevent this from happening again,"" she told a news conference.

Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg apologized on Wednesday for mistakes his company made in how it handled the data of 50 million of its users and promised tougher steps to restrict developers' access to such information.The revelation has knocked nearly $50 billion off Facebook's stock market value in two days and hit the shares of Twitter and Snap over fears that a failure by big tech firms to protect personal data could deter advertisers and users and invite tougher regulation.Barley said that the issue was best dealt with at a European, rather than a national, level. New European Union privacy rules take effect in May.""We know that companies respect the rules when sanctions are particularly painful,"" she said.(Reporting by Joseph Nasr and Emma Thomasson; Editing by Hugh Lawson)        Continue reading the main story

"179","How to Respond to a Trump Twitter Tantrum","AdvertisementOpinionSupported byDavid LeonhardtHow to Respond to a Trump Twitter TantrumImageU.S. Senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, warned President Trump not to fire Robert Mueller, the special counsel.CreditJonathan Ernst/ReutersImageBy David LeonhardtMarch 19, 2018This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday.Several congressional Republicans had the right response to President Trump’s lie-laden tantrum about Robert Mueller yesterday.Firing Mueller, Senator Lindsey Graham said, “would be the beginning of the end of his presidency.” Senator Jeff Flake called it “a massive red line.” Paul Ryan, the speaker of the House, was weaker, letting his spokeswoman say, “Mr. Mueller and his team should be able to do their job” — but that’s still less deferential to Trump than Ryan normally is.And yet The Atlantic’s David Frum notes that this weekend still featured a worrisome example of Congress folding in the face of a Trump assault on the rule of law: the firing of Andrew McCabe, the F.B.I. deputy director. “All this matters even more urgently when you consider the McCabe firing as a road-test for Trump’s method in an impending showdown with Robert Mueller,” Frum writes.Quinta Jurecic and Benjamin Wittes of Lawfare also help explain the McCabe firing.*By now, you’ve probably heard the claim that Americans have grown skeptical of education: Student debt is out of control, a college degree doesn’t guarantee a good job, and on and on.Don’t believe these claims. Yes, many people criticize our education system — and many of those criticisms are legitimate. But the vast majority of Americans understand how important education is, and they very much want their children to get a good education, including college.My column this morning lays out the evidence of real attitudes about education, including a story from the recent Alabama Senate race and a new study by the think tank Demos. Thanks to Morning Consult, a research firm, I was also able to conduct a poll for the column. It asked people what level of education they wanted their kids to receive — high school, community college or four-year college.The results show that all the talk of skepticism is badly exaggerated. And the enormous popularity of education creates an opportunity for anyone running for office this year. Voters are ready to hear ideas about better access to a strong, affordable education.I hope you’ll read the column.*The Times and The Observer of London both had scoops this weekend about the misuse of Facebook data by Cambridge Analytica, a firm employed by the Trump campaign. Wired’s Issie Lapowsky argues that the episode is the latest sign that Facebook needs to change: “Facebook offers unprecedented data to its paying clients, but has next to no controls in place to ensure that data will be handled properly.” You can join me on Twitter (@DLeonhardt) and Facebook.

        NEW YORK — Wall Street scored its best day in 2-1/2 years and the Dow Jones Industrial Average saw its third-biggest point gain ever on Monday, as trade war fears eased on reports the United States and China are willing to renegotiate tariffs and trade imbalances.The rally, fueled by technology stocks, came on the heels of the indexes' worst weekly performance since January 2016, the S&P 500's gain making up for less than half of the prior week's near 6 percent loss.""We saw a really good rally because of potential talks with China,"" said Dennis Dick, Head of Markets Structure, Proprietary Trader at Bright Trading LLC in Las Vegas. ""People are taking advantage of the huge dip last week.""""I don't think you're out of the woods yet. There's political uncertainty,"" Dick added.Last week's drop was fueled in part by tensions surrounding U.S. President Donald Trump's move to levy tariffs on up to $60 billion of Chinese imports, in addition to those imposed on solar panels, steel and aluminum.

Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg have clashed on artificial intelligence, space travel and the direction of technology.On Friday, Mr. Musk showed just how little love lost there was between the two tech titans.Mr. Musk, the chief executive of SpaceX and Tesla, deleted the Facebook pages of both of his companies. In doing so, he joined a growing chorus of tech leaders calling for people to abandon Mr. Zuckerberg’s social network after it allowed a political consulting firm, Cambridge Analytica, to obtain and misuse data on 50 million users. The revelations have plunged Facebook into its worst public relations crisis in years.As with most news in 2018, Mr. Musk’s decision started with a barrage of tweets.The tech luminary began by criticizing Sonos, a maker of wireless speakers, which had pulled some ads from Facebook for a week.“Wow, a whole week. Risky ...,” Mr. Musk tweeted in response to a news article about Sonos’s move.

    The posts, which sent the Twittersphere into a virtual frenzy, escalated a public feud between Mr. Musk and Mr. Zuckerberg. Mr. Musk has often urged people to be cautious of embracing technology such as artificial intelligence because of the consequences it might bring, once saying that it could become so powerful it would start wars and turn people into its “house cats.”

Mr. Zuckerberg has argued that people need to trust and embrace technology in their lives. When the Facebook chief executive was asked about Mr. Musk’s warnings around artificial intelligence during a Facebook Live broadcast in 2017, he called Mr. Musk a “naysayer.” That’s an insult in a technology world that celebrates perpetual optimism.“With A.I. especially, I’m really optimistic,” Mr. Zuckerberg said. “People who are naysayers and kind of try to drum up these doomsday scenarios — I just, I don’t understand it. I think it’s really negative and in some ways I actually think it is pretty irresponsible.”In response, Mr. Musk shot back that Mr. Zuckerberg did not fully comprehend the issues.“I’ve talked to Mark about this,” Mr. Musk wrote. “His understanding of the subject is limited.”The two have also clashed on space travel. Mr. Zuckerberg traveled to Kenya in 2016 for the launch of a Facebook-affiliated satellite called Amos-6, which was set to go to outer space in a SpaceX rocket. But the rocket exploded. Mr. Zuckerberg released a chilly statement.“As I’m here in Africa, I’m deeply disappointed to hear that SpaceX’s launch failure destroyed our satellite that would have provided connectivity to so many entrepreneurs and everyone else across the continent,” he wrote on Facebook.

Mr. Musk is a frequent Twitter presence, who has posted increasingly macho and humor-focused messages including video of himself playing with a flamethrower.He said he plans to keep using his Instagram account, which is owned by Facebook, and on which he has 6.9 million followers.When one reporter said on Twitter that it was remarkable Mr. Musk had so much time to troll online, Mr. Musk wrote, “What, a troll, me!?”

        WASHINGTON —  The U.S. House Intelligence Committee voted along party lines on Thursday to adopt a Republican report on the panel's investigation of Russia and the 2016 U.S. election, formally ending a probe marred for months by bitter partisan conflict.The Republican report found no evidence of collusion between President Donald Trump's campaign and Russian interference. It also disagreed with intelligence agencies' findings that Moscow sought to boost Trump's chances of being elected.Committee Democrats strongly disputed that finding and said they will continue to investigate and, eventually, release their own dissenting report.Representative Adam Schiff, the panel's top Democrat, said Republicans had declined every Democratic motion during their business meeting, including requests to subpoena witnesses who refused to answer questions, and hold an open hearing with chief executives from technology companies, including Facebook Inc's Mark Zuckerberg.

        There are 13 Republicans and nine Democrats on the House Intelligence panel.Schiff called the decision to end the investigation ""a rather sad chapter in our Committee’s long history.""The committee's Republican chairman, Devin Nunes, said the report was based on more than 70 witness interviews and the collection of more than 300,000 documents.It ""will include minority views if the minority submits them,"" Nunes said in a statement.Reports have emerged from whistleblower Christopher Wylie this week that British political consultancy Cambridge Analytica improperly accessed Facebook users' information to build profiles on American voters later used to help elect Trump.Hidden camera footage on British television showed a company official criticizing the House committee's interview.Wylie has agreed to talk to committee Democrats.PARTISANSHIPA summary of report findings concluded Russia conducted cyber attacks on U.S. institutions, using social media to undermine the electoral process. It acknowledged contacts between Trump associates and Russians, including Russian efforts to set up a ""back channel"" to communicate after Trump's election, but said it had not found evidence of collusion.

Russia denies meddling in the U.S. campaign.The Republican summary recommended steps to crack down on intelligence agency leaks, and raised questions about charges facing Trump's former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI.Several congressional Republicans have been harshly critical of the Department of Justice and Federal Bureau of Investigation.Also on Thursday, the Republican chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Representative Bob Goodlatte, subpoenaed the Justice Department for documents related to the investigation of an email server used by Trump's 2016 Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, and the recommendation to fire Andrew McCabe, the FBI deputy director let go last week.

A Justice spokesman said the department takes the committee's inquiry seriously and is committed to accommodating its request in a manner consistent with its responsibilities.The House panel's investigation of how Russia might have sought to influence the 2016 U.S. election, and whether Trump associates colluded with Moscow has been marked by partisan disagreements since it began more than a year ago.Earlier this year, Republicans and Democrats released dueling memos about the probe. Nunes was recused for months after a late-night visit to the White House raised questions about improper communications with Trump associates.In contrast, the Senate Intelligence Committee released bipartisan recommendations on how to improve election security this week and is continuing its investigation, as is Department of Justice Special Counsel Robert Mueller.The probes have shadowed Trump's presidency, and the president has repeatedly denounced them, and Mueller, leading to concerns he might fire the special counsel.(Reporting by Patricia Zengerle; editing by Tom Brown and James Dalgleish)        Continue reading the main story

Both WPP and Publicis appointed single global managers for their biggest clients to provide all the services required by these companies rather than through multiple agencies.Publicis aims to differentiate itself further by offering technological tools, such as platforms and data analysis, to better reach the end-customers.Reports that Cambridge Analytica, a political consultancy hired by Donald Trump, improperly accessed information about 50 million Facebook users is seen by some analysts as positive for Publicis, as big brands may consider traditional ad groups as better managers of their brand image.The challenge for Publicis remains to prove that Sapient, which weighed heavily in a 1.4 billion-euro writedown in 2016, is well integrated into the company and will improve results, analysts have said.($1 = 0.8139 euros)(Reporting by Mathieu Rosemain and Gwenaelle Barzic; Editing by Shri Navaratnam and Adrian Croft)        Continue reading the main story

        BERLIN —  Germany on Tuesday voiced alarm at reports that a political consultancy hired by Donald Trump improperly accessed information on 50 million Facebook users, and lawmakers demanded answers from the company and the government.Germany's data privacy commissioner Andrea Vosshoff said she had no independent information to verify the reports, but the incident underscored the need for stronger privacy regulations.U.S. and European authorities this week said they were investigating reports by the New York Times and Britain's Observer newspaper that Cambridge Analytica, a political consultancy, harvested users' personal data to support Trump's 2016 presidential election campaign.The reports have depressed Facebook shares, and are fueling calls for more regulation in Germany, where Facebook already faces an anti-trust inquiry and a tough new hate crime law.

        Justice Minister Katarina Barley told the Passauer Neue Presse newspaper that Facebook needed to take responsibility and explain how it planned to better protect the privacy of its users in the future.She told the paper that users needed to know what would become of their data before consenting to its use. ""Facebook must adhere to this legal basis. It is time for the company to take clear responsibility,"" she told the newspaper.Privacy rights are a particularly sensitive and emotional issue in Germany after decades of state surveillance carried out by the Nazi regime, and later in Communist East Germany.

Germany's anti-trust regulator last month opened an inquiry into online advertising, responding to concerns expressed by advertisers and publishers about the ""significant"" market position of U.S. platforms Google and Facebook.In December, the Federal Cartel Office also accused Facebook of abusing its dominant position to collect the personal data of its 2 billion users worldwide.Facebook is also grappling with a new law under which the company and other social media sites can be fined up to 50 million euros if they fail to promptly remove hateful messages.Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives and the Social Democrats called on Tuesday for an extraordinary session of the German parliament's digital committee to debate the latest reports, conservative lawmaker Thomas Jarzombek said.""We want to question Facebook about whether German users were also affected, and whether a comparable mechanism could endanger the data of German users,"" he told Reuters.Patrick Sensburg, another conservative lawmaker, called for ""much harder sanctions"" against Facebook and said the EU should consider financial penalties. ""The German government and the EU must demand that Facebook provide comprehensive answers and informs those affected,"" he told German daily Bild.

        SEOUL, South Korea —  South Korea's telecoms regulator has fined Facebook for illegally limiting user access to its services from late 2016 to 2017.The Korea Communications Commission said Wednesday that Facebook should pay 396 million won ($369,400) as a penalty for violating a law against hurting the interests of users. The regulator also recommended that the company change its terms of use stipulating it cannot guarantee the quality of its services.The issue is unrelated to Facebook's troubles over allegations that Trump-affiliated data-mining firm Cambridge Analytica stole data from 50 million Facebook users to influence U.S. elections. But the social media giant has faced other complaints in Asia over access and privacy.The South Korean flap arose after Facebook rerouted some users' access to its services to networks in Hong Kong or the United States, instead of using domestic networks, without notifying them, the regulator said. That slowed connections for some local Facebook users, and some complained they were unable to play videos on Facebook. The KCC said connections were as much as 4.5 times slower than before for some users during evening hours.

SK Broadband, a local fixed-line internet provider, received about 10 complaints per day for slow connections while LG UPlus, another internet service provider, received an average of 34 complaints a day.        Continue reading the main story

        ""Facebook did not actively look into the complaints from local telecoms service providers that users are complaining about slower connections and as a result its service quality was not maintained at an appropriate level,"" the KCC said in a statement. ""When controversies erupted in South Korea about Facebook's rerouting, the company restored the connections to their original state around October and November of 2017.""The KCC said the U.S. social media giant violated a law against limiting access or subscriptions to its services without convincing reasons.

""We are disappointed with the KCC's decision. We strive to deliver optimal performance for all our users and will continue working with Korean internet service providers toward this goal,"" Facebook said in a statement.The probe was launched in May last year after reports it had interfered with some local users' access to Facebook and Instagram.The KCC probed claims that Facebook intentionally slowed access while it negotiated network usage fees with internet service providers.Facebook has gained traction in South Korea in recent years and politicians and celebrities often use it to interact with fans. More than 12 million users visit Facebook per day in South Korea, according to the KCC.Facebook said it did not violate the law in part because its terms of use say it cannot guarantee its services will operate without delays or interference. KCC officials rejected that argument, saying the terms were unfair. It recommended the company amend its terms of use.        Continue reading the main story

        NEW YORK —  Sure. Take that quiz about which hair-metal band is your spirit animal. Share a few snaps of your toddler at the beach and watch the likes pile up. Comment on that pointed political opinion from the classmate you haven't seen since the Reagan administration.Just remember that your familiar, comforting online neighborhood — the people you care about most and those you only kinda like — exists entirely on a corporate planet that's endlessly ravenous to know more about you and yours.On a day when our virtual friends wrung their virtual hands about whether to leave Facebook, a thoroughly 21st-century conundrum was hammered home: When your community is a big business, and when a company's biggest business is your community, things can get very messy.You saw that all day Tuesday as users watched the saga of Cambridge Analytica unfold and contemplated whether the chance that they had been manipulated again — that their data might have been used to influence an election — was, finally, reason enough to bid Facebook goodbye.

        Facebook, which began as a social network for college students and the academic community, has experienced exodus before, albeit usually more gradually.Young people have edged away from it in favor of other platforms such as Snapchat, WhatsApp and Instagram (the latter two are owned by Facebook now), and many maintain a presence but use it rarely. Internationally, while Facebook remains widespread, insurgent social networks built around messaging, such as Line in Japan and Thailand, WeChat in China and KakaoTalk in South Korea, have supplanted it.But as the granddaddy of the major social networks, Facebook boasts more than 2.2 billion users — nearly 30 percent of the world's population, a community vastly larger than any nation. That's an irresistible target for advertisers and, it turns out, for people who want to do some sketchy things with data and even influence elections.And for users, anyplace brimming with lots and lots of interesting people is often — just by virtue of that fact — the place to be.But when you really think about it, what, precisely, IS that place?Most of us, as end users, interact with Facebook as the global equivalent of a neighborhood or a town square — Mayberry meets Bedford Falls from ""It's A Wonderful Life,"" but with the miles that separate so many of us compressed to mere inches.Friends stop by to chat and catch up. They show us some photos, catch up with our lives and move on. Sometimes you'll overhear neighbors talking about something and you'll wander over to chime in. You know some people better than others, some barely at all. Some are looking for approval. Some want to pick a fight. Some just want to play a game on the green and move on.Trouble is, what in the real world is legit social interaction with few strings attached becomes, in the virtual one, an intricate and heavily mediated transaction.

Or, put another way, the community itself is authentic, but the town square is rigged with booby traps and there's no mayor or police patrolling on our behalf.""When we go to, say, a party, the analog parameters that define the social space in which we're celebrating the community are visible. You know who's there and what the outcomes of your interactions are,"" says John Drew, who teaches digital media at Adelphi University in Garden City, New York.

Facebook, he says, ""created a system that's inherently social — your friends are there posting — but while you're doing that posting and looking at other people's posts, they have been building an advertising empire,"" he says. ""The people who are throwing the party — that's Facebook. And they're controlling the rules.""On Tuesday, angst was popping up all over as people discussed the virtues and drawbacks of leaving Facebooktown forever.One common response to people who said they might go: Don't — how will I see your kids growing up? Other would-be exiters wondered how they'd keep track of THEIR kids if they quit. Still others expressed the perennial wish of Facebook users when confronted with contentious debate: Can't we all just post nice things and stay away from politics?And finally, the payoff question: Will Facebook even LET me quit? (Yes, but they don't make it particularly easy.)The doubt is entirely understandable.This is — in America, at least — an era where the pillars of community have crumbled. Polls show Americans trust institutions less and less. Membership in unions and civic organizations — longtime community glue — is also sharply down, and job transfers and increased mobility can cleave in-person friendships like never before.Is it any wonder, then, that so many people covet the bonds of community — even virtual community — and the reinforcement that accompanies them? Is it a surprise that people struggle about whether to give up this fixture of their lives that, yes, features some unpleasantly aggressive tentacles but also serves up the miniature dopamine rushes of approval from those we care about? Isn't that, in essence, one of community's key functions?""One of the reasons Facebook is so popular is that it feels to people like it's free. They have no sense that they're giving anything up, or what they're giving up,"" says George Loewenstein, a behavioral economist and the Herbert A. Simon professor of economics and psychology at Carnegie Mellon University.

""Generally, people detest the feeling of being a sucker. They detest the idea that someone else has taken advantage of them. But so far, it's too intangible to people,"" he says. ""If we had a beer and someone took it away from us, we'd be very upset. But if it's information, people get a whole lot less upset.""We're only a quarter century into the internet, really. We may not yet be wired for the conditional communities that something like Facebook offers — a community like no other in history.The notion of being handed a multimedia pass to all your friends, wherever they might be, for free, holds immense appeal — even if ""free"" turns out to mean ""we're watching you and making money and maybe pulling some of your psychological chains to our own ends.""The question that faces all of us who contemplate our Facebook departures comes down to this in the end: Is rejecting this particular corporation important enough to you to reject the community that it serves up? How much are your ""friends"" worth?Also: Def Leppard is your spirit animal. Carry on.___Ted Anthony writes about American culture for The Associated Press.

Good morning.(Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.)Facebook has had a particularly bad few days, even for a Silicon Valley giant that has been under fire for months. The social network, which was once Silicon Valley’s pride and joy, is now facing a new scandal over data privacy — and the fallout has been intense and keeps widening.Let’s recap how it all unfolded:

Over the weekend, The New York Times, along with The Observer of London and The Guardian, broke the news that a British political consulting firm, Cambridge Analytica, improperly obtained data on 50 million Facebook users and used it to target messages to potential American voters.The revelations set off an immediate hue and cry. American and British lawmakers demanded that Facebook explain how the data had been harvested without people being alerted. Senator Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat from Minnesota, pressed Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, to appear before lawmakers in person. Others have since piled on.On Monday, The Times reported that Facebook’s executive in charge of information security, Alex Stamos, was planning to leave the social network by August. The move reflected heightened internal tensions at the top of the company, showing how the scrutiny has taken a toll.

Criticism of Facebook intensified on Tuesday. Wall Street investors sold off the company’s shares, with a nearly 7 percent drop on Monday and a 2.5 percent fall on Tuesday. To top it off, the Federal Trade Commission opened an investigation into whether Facebook violated an agreement on data privacy, sparked by the Cambridge Analytica reports.

        Where have Mr. Zuckerberg and other Facebook leaders been in all of this, you may ask? Good question. The top brass at the company’s headquarters in Menlo Park have been silent for days.

            And Finally ...The rain storms hitting California this week have been called many things, but two related terms keep popping up to describe this weather system: “atmospheric river” and “Pineapple Express.”So which one is it?“Pineapple Express was a term for many years used to identify storms that came from Hawaii and hit the West Coast,” said Marty Ralph, a research meteorologist affiliated with U.C. San Diego’s Scripps Institution of Oceanography. “About 15 years ago we recognized that there’s a broader definition called an atmospheric river, and those happen all over the planet.”For non-scientists, atmospheric rivers can be conceptualized visually.“If you look from space from a satellite, it does look like a sinuous river,” said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at U.C.L.A. “It’s a colorful term, and it’s actually the official meteorological term to describe this process.”

But while all Pineapple Express storms are atmospheric rivers, not all atmospheric rivers are classified as Pineapple Express storms.The source for the particular atmospheric river hitting California this week is near the Hawaiian Islands, hence the playful “Pineapple Express.” Not everyone agrees, though, that this storm falls under that category.“I wouldn’t call this one a Pineapple Express. The storm is coming from the West, but the tail of this atmospheric river didn’t come from Hawaii, it came from east of Hawaii,” Mr. Ralph said. “But I’m not sure about arguing the jargon too much on this. The modern term is atmospheric river.”Nomenclature aside, Mr. Swain urged residents in burn areas not to ignore the orders because of storm fatigue. Though the storm may not hit Los Angeles too hard, it could wallop those in Santa Barbara County. The forecast is severe, and if water falls too quickly it could lead to substantial flooding and mudslides.“The forecast is for a really, really big rain,” he said. “Maybe half a foot or more of water is going to fall in a lot of places that have had intense fire activity. Whether all those inches of rain fall over three days or in a six hours is hard to predict.”

        NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO —  Fewer than half of Americans trust Facebook to obey U.S. privacy laws, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Sunday, illustrating the challenge facing the social media network after a scandal over its handling of personal information.The poll, taken Wednesday through Friday, also found that fewer Americans trust Facebook than other tech companies that gather user data, such as Apple Inc, Alphabet Inc's Google, Amazon.com Inc, Microsoft Corp and Yahoo.Some 41 percent of Americans trust Facebook to obey laws that protect their personal information, compared with 66 percent who said they trust Amazon, 62 percent who trust Google, 60 percent for Microsoft and 47 percent for Yahoo.The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online in English throughout the United States. It gathered responses from 2,237 people and has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 2 percentage points. (Graphic: https://tmsnrt.rs/2pA8DoG)

        Facebook shares tumbled 14 percent last week, while the hashtag #DeleteFacebook gained traction online and the company's chief executive officer, Mark Zuckerberg, faced demands that he appear before U.S. lawmakers to testify in a hearing.Zuckerberg and Facebook's chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, said last week that shoring up trust was their priority. ""We know this is an issue of trust. We know this is a critical moment for our company,"" Sandberg told CNBC on Thursday.It is too early to say if distrust will cause people to step back from Facebook, eMarketer analyst Debra Williamson said. Customers of banks or other industries do not necessarily quit after losing faith, she said.""It's psychologically harder to let go of a platform like Facebook that's become pretty well ingrained into people's lives,"" she said.One reason that Facebook and other internet companies collect personal information from users is to deliver advertisements for products and services to people who are most likely to want them.Facebook, with more than 2 billion monthly active users, made almost all its $40.6 billion in revenue last year from advertising.

The poll found that many people take a dim view of those ""targeted"" advertisements.Some 63 percent said they would like to see ""less targeted advertising"" in the future, while 9 percent said they wanted more. When asked to compare them with traditional forms of advertising, 41 percent said targeted ads are ""worse"" while 21 percent said they are ""better.""""I think they make a lot of assumptions that are not true,"" poll respondent Maria Curran, 56, who lives near Manchester, New Hampshire, said in a follow-up interview.

""It's like if I show an interest in healthy eating, all of a sudden all of the ads are about weight control and exercise and how to lose weight. I just get inundated,"" she said.Curran said she knows online retailer Amazon.com also collects her information for targeted marketing, but that it is less annoying because it is a shopping site, not a place for personal conversations.Another poll respondent, Kamaal Greene, 26, said he likes targeted ads better than traditional ones because they provide a service, steering him to products he wants.""A while ago I was looking for a special kind of glove for my job,"" said Greene, a firefighter from Detroit.""I put it in my Amazon cart and forgot about it. Then, later, the ad popped up on ... Facebook, and I was like 'oh shoot.' It reminded me and I clicked on it and bought it.""A plurality of adults said they would like the government to take a bigger role in overseeing the industry's handling of user information. According to the poll, 46 percent of adults said they want more government regulation, while 17 percent said they want less. Another 20 percent said they wanted no change, and the remaining 18 percent said they did not know.(Reporting by Chris Kahn in New York and David Ingram in San Francisco; Editing by Leslie Adler)        Continue reading the main story

WASHINGTON — House Intelligence Committee Republicans said Thursday that opposition to Donald J. Trump by the party’s national security establishment had opened the door for two foreign policy advisers whose interactions with Russian intelligence prompted F.B.I. scrutiny.The Republicans said they had found no evidence that either man, George Papadopoulos and Carter Page, had colluded with the Russians, despite the F.B.I.’s interest in the men. Nor did campaign advisers and aides provide evidence that any member of the Trump campaign had colluded either, according to summaries of 44 findings and more than two dozen recommendations the committee voted to release Thursday.“When asked directly, none of the interviewed witnesses provided evidence of collusion, coordination or conspiracy between the Trump campaign and the Russian government,” one of the findings read.First previewed last week, the findings are the culmination of a year-old investigation by the committee. Democrats say the Republicans hurried the investigation, ignored crucial evidence and failed to follow obvious leads in an effort to clear Mr. Trump.

Other findings were less controversial and reflected the consensus position of American intelligence agencies and both parties on Capitol Hill. Representative K. Michael Conaway, Republican of Texas, who led the inquiry, said that the committee had found “a pattern of Russian active measures in the United States, both through cyberattacks and their use of social media to sow discord.”        Continue reading the main story

        “This poses a serious threat to future U.S. elections, including the primary elections that are already underway,” he said in a statement. “It’s critical to release this information now to protect our country and our elections from foreign interference.”In addition to releasing the summary findings, the committee voted to release a Republican-written 250-page report over the objections of the committee’s Democrats, who offered a series of unsuccessful last-ditch motions to subpoena witnesses and documents, as well as to urge the House to hold Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump’s former adviser, in contempt.“It was a fundamentally unserious effort,” said Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the panel.

Democrats are drafting a dissenting report based on the committee’s work thus far and have pledged to push on with their investigation without Republican cooperation. They have secured the cooperation of at least one new witness, Christopher Wylie, who helped found Cambridge Analytica and develop the company’s voter-profiling technology.The Republican report chronicles Russia’s increasingly brazen efforts in the run-up to the 2016 election to compromise the United States’ political institutions and fan existing divisions among voters. It concludes that the response by the Obama administration had been “insufficient” and said an October 2016 public statement calling out Russia proved “ineffective.”The report takes issue with the “analytical tradecraft” used by intelligence agencies that concluded that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia had wanted to harm the candidacy of Hillary Clinton and help Mr. Trump.More divisive are the findings on collusion. That subject remains an area of inquiry by the Senate Intelligence Committee and the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, who took over the F.B.I.’s investigation of the Trump campaign last year.

The House Republicans said that they had found repeated contacts between members of the Trump campaign team and Russians, but in each case, they concluded that there was no evidence of improper collaboration. Mr. Papadopoulos’s attempts to connect the Trump campaign with the Russians had been “unsuccessful.”Contacts with WikiLeaks were “ill advised,” but did not show evidence that Trump associates were involved in the hacking or publication of Democratic emails, Republicans said. And though the Republicans said they were “concerned” about Mr. Page’s “seemingly incomplete accounts” of a summer 2016 trip to Moscow, they noted that he had not been traveling on behalf of the campaign.“Possible Russian efforts to set up a ‘back channel’ with Trump associates after the election suggest the absence of collusion during the campaign, since the communication associated with collusion would have rendered such a ‘back channel’ unnecessary,” the Republicans wrote in another finding.Many of the committee’s recommendations center on the securing of the United States’ voting systems and echo those presented by the Senate Intelligence Committee in recent days, including steps to improve communications of threats between states and the federal government and to ensure voting systems are not hacked.Others could prove more controversial. For instance, the Republicans recommend that Congress consider repealing the Logan Act, a 1799 statute that bars private citizens from interfering with American diplomatic relations. The statute has never been successfully used in court but has been discussed in connection with contacts between Michael T. Flynn, Mr. Trump’s first national security adviser, and the Russian ambassador at the time during the presidential transition.They also recommend that the executive branch consider mandatory polygraph tests for political appointees with top secret security clearances who are not confirmed by the Senate.

        NEW YORK —  The crisis-management playbook is pretty simple: Get ahead of the story, update authorities and the public regularly, accept responsibility and take decisive action. Crisis-management experts say that until Wednesday, Facebook was 0-for-4.Facebook's two top executives, CEO Mark Zuckerberg and chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg, went radio silent after news broke last Friday that political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica may have used data improperly obtained from roughly 50 million Facebook users to try to sway elections, including the 2016 White House race.It was not until five days after the scandal erupted that Zuckerberg spoke up.Meanwhile, some Facebook users have been leaving the social network or mulling the possibility , and Facebook's stock is down 9 percent since Friday.Facebook's handling of the growing public-relations crisis is remarkable in that one of the world's biggest companies seems not to be playing by well-established crisis-management rules.

""This will go down as the textbook case study as how not to handle a crisis,"" said Scott Galloway, a New York University professor of marketing. ""The only thing we know about this and are comfortable predicting is that it's going to get worse.""        Continue reading the main story

        In his statement Wednesday — posted, of course, on Facebook — Zuckerberg acknowledged that mistakes were made, outlined changes the company has undertaken, and accepted responsibility for the problem.Experts said acknowledging accountability was a positive but the fact that Zuckerberg didn't outright apologize is a negative.""My biggest skepticism is that we've seen this play before,"" said Helio Fred Garcia, a professor of crisis management at NYU and Columbia University in New York. ""They're caught coming short of customers' privacy expectations. They tweak procedures. But they don't seem to learn from mistakes, don't really seem to care.""Most Fortune 500 companies adhere to well-established crisis-management rules. When video surfaced of a passenger being dragged from an overbooked United Airlines flight last April, for example, CEO Oscar Munoz at first hedged but then apologized . When Pepsi ran an ad last spring featuring Kendall Jenner that appeared to trivialize the ""Black Lives Matter"" movement, the company pulled the ad , saying, ""Clearly we missed the mark, and we apologize.""

The point is to at least make an effort to seem remorseful to win back public trust, experts say. But despite user outcry on its own Facebook page and a call from Congress for Zuckerberg to testify about Facebook's role in election-meddling, Facebook seems to be charting its own course.""At this point, 'Why did you wait so long to make a statement?' is now news in itself,"" Paul Argenti, a business professor at Dartmouth, said before Zuckerberg spoke up.It's a pattern Facebook has long followed, according to Garcia. Facebook hedged during its early days in 2007 over a controversial advertising program called Beacon that did not alert users it was sharing their activity, and it did so again in its response to Russian bots hijacking Facebook ad software during the Trump campaign in 2016.""Facebook has been too late. Facebook has done too little and has been too legalistic"" each time, Garcia said. ""I have yet to find a crisis Facebook handled that I could stand in front of crisis management classes and say, 'Here's an example of how to handle a crisis.' They've never been able to handle a crisis.""

Now that Zuckerberg has addressed the public, the PR flap may eventually be forgotten. But it will take a lot longer than if the company had addressed public concerns immediately, Garcia said.""It's much harder to restore trust once it has been lost than to preserve trust before it has been lost,"" he said.___This story has been corrected to show that Facebook's ad program was 2007, not 1997, and that the data-mining story broke on Friday, not Sunday.

Yet for now, at least, investors think the company has an amazing future.This optimism is reflected in the price of Dropbox’s shares after they traded publicly for the first time on Friday. They leaped to $29 per share from $21, giving Dropbox, which charges businesses and individuals to store files on its computers, a market value of $12.7 billion. Putting that number in context reveals the bullishness of investors. Dropbox didn’t have any profits in recent years, so comparisons have to be done using revenue and cash flows.

        At $29, Dropbox is trading at 11.5 times last year’s revenue of $1.1 billion. That is far higher than the 2.6 times sales for the companies in the Nasdaq index, according to Bloomberg data.Of course, Dropbox’s shares have benefited from demand for initial public offerings by technology companies. The stock might give back the gains, just as Snap’s did after its I.P.O. last year.Still, Dropbox’s fans believe that the company has a strong financial future, despite competition from the likes of Google and Amazon. One of their main arguments is that the company can increase its revenue faster than its costs, a dynamic that should expand profit margins over time. Rishi N. Jaluria, an analyst at D.A. Davidson, zeros in on its free cash flows, the amount of cash generated by a business after subtracting spending on plants and certain lease payments, to show this.His measure of free cash flows was equivalent to 16 percent of revenue last year, but, in his estimation, that margin could rise to 19 percent this year, then 22 percent in 2019.After Friday’s huge pop, Dropbox’s stock has arguably “priced in” the impressive future cash flows that some analysts expect. Indeed, using Mr. Jaluria’s forecasts, Dropbox’s shares are already trading at a far higher cash flow valuation than that of Salesforce, a software and cloud computing company with a long track record.What is more, Dropbox has areas of concern that should, in theory, give investors pause. The number of paid users grew 25 percent last year, slower than the 35 percent rate in 2016. Its average revenue per paying user edged up just 1 percent last year. Facebook’s shares trade at the same multiple to sales as Dropbox’s. Yet its revenue per user surged 26 percent last year.— Peter Eavis

Markets don’t like Trump’s tariffsThe closer investors look at President Trump’s tariffs against China, the less they seem to like them.This can be seen in the way the stock market has responded to the trade restrictions, which were announced on Thursday but were flagged a few days earlier. The S.&P. 500 index was down 5.95 percent this week, falling every day but one. And the selling at the end of the week looked like like it was turning into a rout, with the S.&P. 500 skidding 2.52 percent on Thursday and 2.1 percent on Friday.We know that Mr. Trump watches the stock market’s response to his policies. He was reassured when the stock market rose after he announced tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. Will this week’s nosedive unsettle him to the point he softens his stance on trade with China? Mr. Trump sounded unfazed on Friday. “I think the stock market is going to be great,” he said.

            Trump signs spending bill.The president abruptly backed down from his threat to veto the $1.3 trillion spending bill and signed it into law on Friday, avoiding a government shutdown.Early in the day, the president had tweeted his displeasure with the bill, citing Congress’s failure to fund his long-promised border wall.From this morning:
        
            I am considering a VETO of the Omnibus Spending Bill based on the fact that the 800,000 plus DACA recipients have been totally abandoned by the Democrats (not even mentioned in Bill) and the BORDER WALL, which is desperately needed for our National Defense, is not fully funded.         —
        Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)
        March 23, 2018
    
    Julie Hirschfeld and Michael D. Shear of the NYT:But the president was most angry about the lack of funding in the bill for a massive wall on the nation’s southern border that he has billed as the centerpiece of his crackdown on illegal immigrants. The measure includes nearly $1.6 billion for border security — including new technology and repairs to existing barriers — but not Mr. Trump’s wall, as he claimed on Twitter on Wednesday. It provides $641 million for about 33 miles of fencing, but prohibits building a concrete structure or other prototypes the president has considered, and allocates the rest of the funding for new aircraft, sensors and surveillance technology.(The backstory to the bill: Here’s how Congressional leaders settled lawmakers’ objections.)Mark Zuckerberg and the congressional hearing aheadAs Facebook plunged into a crisis over how Cambridge Analytica, a political consulting firm that provided voter-targeting services to the Trump campaign, improperly obtained data on 50 million Facebook users, Mark Zuckerberg came under criticism for saying nothing. Finally, on Wednesday he released a statement and sat down for interviews. We asked Paul Pendergrass, a long time corporate communication professional and formerly DealBook’s “Jack Flack” columnist, to offer his insights into the situation: In most of the interviews on Wednesday, Mark Zuckerberg was asked if he would be willing to testify before Congress, a task he has previously delegated to other senior Facebook executives.“I’d be happy to…” he told CNN’s Laurie Segall, before immediately qualifying that answer with, “if it’s the right thing to do.”He then went on to offer Facebook’s standard response to questions about why it has previously chosen other executives for Congressional hearings.The goal there is to get Congress all the information that they need to do their extremely important job. And we just want to send the person whoever is best informed to do that.He elaborated:The question in Congressional testimony is, “What is the goal?” That’s not a media opportunity. At least it’s not supposed to be.Mr. Zuckerberg was surely being coy. When Congress requests the presence of a C.E.O. embroiled in a high-profile controversy, they’re usually not looking for information. They want a pelt to hang on the wall, and celebrity chief executives are particularly attractive.So it’s definitely a media opportunity… but for members of Congress, not the C.E.O.If Mr. Zuckerberg wants proof of that, he can ask John Stumpf, the former C.E.O. of Wells Fargo, and the bank’s current chief executive, Tim Sloan, how much information they were asked to provide. He could ask the same of the C.E.O. of United Airlines, Oscar Munoz, about his trip to Capitol Hill just after a passenger was dragged off one of his airplanes. For that matter, Mr. Zuckerberg could walk down the hallway and ask Facebook’s general counsel, Colin Stretch. Just last fall Mr. Stretch endured a Senate lashing over the use of Facebook by Russian operatives.When Mr. Zuckerberg is brought in to testify, the committee’s “goal” will be to ensure the American public understands why social media platforms can’t be trusted to regulate themselves. Mr. Zuckerberg’s goal will be to try to avoid acting in a way that would elevate his role as the designated villain in the story.

Mr. Zuckerberg seems resigned to the fact that he will likely end up testifying. “I would imagine at some time there will be a topic where I will be the sole authority on, and it will make sense for me to do it,” he told Ms. Segall.After this past week, he will have little leeway to refuse. Having been roundly accused of hiding in the crucial early days of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, he won’t want to provide further evidence that he is inaccessible when people need to see him most.Photo

            Did China intervene to support its stock market?China’s state-backed funds have a history of stepping in to smooth out swings in the country’s stock market. And so on Friday as China stocks tumbled amid fears of a trade war with the United States, those funds began buying, Bloomberg reports, citing unnamed sources.They purchased large-cap stocks, including Sinopec and China Life Insurance Co., Bloomberg reports.Shares of both those companies erased losses late in the trading session, and the large-cap CSI 300 Index finished down 2.9 percent after falling as much as 4.6 percent.— Stephen GrocerMaybe not so fast on a Target-Kroger deal?Shares in both retailers are up in premarket trading this morning after Fast Company reported that the two sides are weighing a union. Shares in Kroger were up 4 percent, while those in Target were up over 2 percent.

The purported rationale: the usual one. Retailers are under pressure from Amazon and need to get bigger both in brick-and-mortar stores and online.But Fast Company cautioned, “The companies appear to be struggling to decide whether a merger is the best path forward.” And Courtney Reagan of CNBC, citing an unnamed source, threw cold water on the idea:
        
            A source close to the matter tells me there is no truth to the idea of a @Target and @kroger merger. I can report the 2 companies have had meetings, but over the @Shipt partnership...which, Target now owns $TGT $KR         —

• The publisher of New York magazine bought Splitsider from The Awl Network. (WSJ)• Deutsche Bank priced the spinoff of its DWS asset-management unit at the low end of the expected range. (WSJ)— Michael J. de la MercedToo little, too late.Broadcom’s shareholders approved the chip maker’s decision to move its headquarters to the United States from Singapore. The move is expected to be completed after the market’s close on April 4.The vote comes nearly two weeks after President Trump blocked Broadcom’s $117 billion bid for Qualcomm, citing national security concerns.

The decision was a blow to Broadcom and its chief executive, Hock Tan, who had gone to great lengths to deflect concerns by American regulators and the Trump administration. That included appearing in a televised speech at the White House with Mr. Trump last November, during which Mr. Tan promised to redomicile Broadcom in the United States.Will the U.S.-China trade fight be a flicker or an inferno?They’re here. President Trump imposed $60 billion worth of tariffs and penalties on Chinese goods. China is threatening tariffs on $3 billion worth of U.S. goods like nuts, wine and pork. Now S.&P. 500 futures and markets in Asia and Europe are down this morning, following yesterday’s steep sell-off (which was driven in large part by Boeing).The context: Mr. Trump has made subtext — China is the U.S.’s main economic rival and must be treated as a strategic competitor — text. Few in the U.S. are happy with Beijing’s trade and intellectual property policies. But the world is now watching to see whether the fight turns out to be a spat, or a prolonged and damaging conflict.Peter Eavis’s take: A trade fight that eventually relaxes some of China’s disadvantageous conditions could bolster the long-term prospects of U.S. firms. And if the U.S. is able to recruit other countries to its cause, China may relent. Still, much could go wrong.On the other tariffs: The E.U. is still waiting for confirmation of exemptions from the imported metals tariffs. They may get quotas instead. Meet Century Aluminum, the tiny manufacturer that pressed for those penalties.Critics’ corner• Stephen Gandel of Gadfly writes, “Trump’s tariffs and especially his protectionist rhetoric threaten to cut more and more of the world off.”• Paul Krugman writes, “America has much less trade leverage over China than Trump imagines, and a trade war with ‘China’ will anger a wider group of countries, some of them close allies.”• The WSJ editorial board writes, “A rising and aggressive China poses considerable risks to world order, but persuading its leaders to conform to trading norms requires more than scattershot tariffs.”

        NEW YORK —  Facebook's latest privacy scandal, involving Trump campaign consultants who allegedly stole data on tens of millions of users in order to influence elections, has some people reconsidering their relationship status with the social network.There's just one problem: There isn't much of anywhere else to go.Facebook has weathered many such blow-ups before and is used to apologizing and moving on. But the stakes are bigger this time.Regulatory authorities are starting to focus on the data misappropriation, triggering a 9 percent decline in Facebook's normally high-flying stock since Monday. Some of that reflects fear that changes in Facebook's business will hurt profits or that advertisers and users will sour on the social network.The furor over Cambridge Analytica, the data mining firm accused of stealing Facebook data, follows a bad year in which Facebook acknowledged helping spread fake news and propaganda from Russian agents. It also comes less than three months after CEO Mark Zuckerberg told the world that he would devote the year to fixing Facebook. Instead, things seem to be getting worse.

        Yet leaving Facebook, like ending a long marriage, isn't remotely simple. Starting with the little things.Arvind Rajan, a tech executive from San Francisco who deactivated his account on Monday, suddenly discovered he needs to create new usernames and passwords for a variety of apps and websites. That's because he previously logged in with his Facebook ID.It's a pain, he said, ""but not the end of the world."" And because he is bothered by Facebook's ""ham-handed"" response to recent problems, the inconvenience is worth it.For other users looking to leave, it can feel as if there are no real alternatives. Twitter? Too flighty, too public. Instagram? Whoops, owned by Facebook. Snapchat? Please, unless you're under 25 — in which case you're probably not on Facebook to begin with.Facebook connects 2.2 billion users and a host of communities that have sprung up on its network. No other company can match the breadth or depth of these connections — thanks in part to Facebook's proclivity for squashing or swallowing up its competition.But it is precisely in Facebook's interest to make users feel Facebook is the only place to connect with others. Where else will grandmothers see photos of their far-flung grandkids? How will new mothers connect to other parents also up at 4 a.m. with a newborn?""My only hesitation is that there are hundreds of pictures posted over 13 years of my life that I do not want to lose access to. If there was a way to recover these photos, I would deactivate immediately,"" Daniel Schwartz, who lives in Atlanta, said in an email.

People eager to delete their profiles may find unexpected problems that point to how integral Facebook is to many activities, said Ifeoma Ajunwa, a professor of organizational behavior at Cornell University.

""It is getting more and more difficult for people to delete Facebook, since it's not just as a social media platform but also almost like a meeting square,"" she said.Parents could soon realize that their child's soccer schedule with games and pickup times is only on a Facebook page, for example. Many businesses also schedule meetings via Facebook.""It's more and more difficult for people to feel plugged in if you're not on Facebook,"" Ajunwa said.There are no signs, so far, that users are leaving in droves — and advertisers go where the eyeballs are, so they aren't leaving either. Research firm eMarketer hasn't changed its estimate that worldwide ad spending on Facebook will climb 22 percent this year to nearly $49 billion.Still, if ""Facebook were forced to change the way it uses data or the way its ad products work, then advertisers may become less enamored with it,"" said Debra Aho Williamson, an analyst with the firm.Not surprisingly, Facebook doesn't make it easy to leave. To permanently delete your account, you need to make a request to the company. The process can take several days, and if you log in during this time, your request will be canceled. It can take up to 90 days to delete everything.There's a less permanent way to leave, deactivation, which hides your profile from everyone but lets you return if you change your mind.Lili Orozco, a 28-year-old office manager for her family's heating and cooling company in Watkinsville, Georgia, deleted her account in December. She was upset that every new app she downloaded would ask for her Facebook contacts.And while she liked staying in touch with people, she was irritated by the conspiracy stories her high school friends would share.""Falsehoods spread faster on Facebook than the truth does,"" she said. She now gets her news from Twitter and shares pictures with friends through Instagram.

        As questions mounted last year about whether Facebook had been exploited to tilt the U.S. presidential election, Mark Zuckerberg landed on a fishing trawler off Alabama's Gulf coast.But the chatter surrounding the CEO's arrival in port was that it signaled something bigger than just the start of a 30-state personal tour: his designs on a job even more powerful than leading the social network that links 2.2 billion people worldwide.""I asked him if he was interested in running for president of the United States,"" said Dominick Ficarino, who owns a shrimp business in Bayou La Batre, Alabama, and hosted Zuckerberg that afternoon. ""And his answer to me was: 'Can I answer you with a question? If you were me, would you?'""Thirteen months later, Zuckerberg no longer has the luxury of mulling a hypothetical next act. Instead, he is grappling with a crisis that has enveloped the company synonymous with his face and name. It does not help that the most glaring reminder of Facebook's flaws is the unabated uproar over the American presidency itself.

        In 2017, the billionaire sought to travel to every state he'd never visited. This year, Zuckerberg said his personal goal is to ""fix"" Facebook.Yet things continue to get worse. Scrutiny of Facebook has intensified following reports that it failed to prevent the data-mining firm Cambridge Analytica from amassing personal information about millions of users — possibly used to aid Donald Trump's campaign — and that the social network has been collecting Android users' phone call and text message histories without notice. That adds to criticism that Facebook manipulates its users and has allowed Russian bots to divide Americans by spreading false information.On Monday, the Federal Trade Commission announced it was investigating Facebook for its privacy practices.Zuckerberg preaches transparency, but flinches at questioning. He is undeniably brilliant, but stubborn about acknowledging the extent of Facebook's problems.Is he prepared to do all it will take the right the ship?""If he fails to do it, it may take a while but eventually people are going to rebel,"" said Roger McNamee, an early Facebook investor and adviser who has become a pointed critic.""I thought Facebook was a force for good in the world for a really long time,"" McNamee said. ""I think it's really hard to make that case today.""Days after Trump's election, Zuckerberg was pressed on the possibility that foreign agents had used his social network to divide voters.

""The idea that fake news on Facebook ... influenced the election in any way, I think, is a pretty crazy idea,"" the CEO said at a technology conference.""I think all of us were shocked to learn how wrong he was,"" said David Kirkpatrick, the author of a 2010 book about Facebook who questioned Zuckerberg that day.Zuckerberg walked back the remark soon after, continuing a years-long routine of self-correction. But errors that reflect his stubbornness, those who know him say, are tempered by an eagerness to learn and a deep sense of reflection.Naomi Gleit, Facebook's longest-serving employee after the CEO, said Zuckerberg — who declined an interview request from The Associated Press — has talked about making the world a better place since he was 21. But his view of his place in that world seemed like ""a burden of responsibility,"" she said.

With Zuckerberg, ""its experiment, learn, experiment, learn,"" said LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, who has known him since 2004.But in the process of learning, Zuckerberg's inexperience has sometimes played out in public view, such as when he donated $100 million to Newark, New Jersey, schools in 2010 with few specifics outlining how the money should be spent.""He was just a very young, naive, inexperienced guy who was brilliant ... but just really didn't know much about how the world worked,"" said Dale Russakoff, author of ""The Prize,"" a book chronicling the Newark experiment.Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, have since chartered their own foundation to take on mammoth goals, like a $3 billion investment to cure, prevent or manage all diseases.To free up his fortune for philanthropy, Zuckerberg last year pushed board members to restructure Facebook's stock, allowing him to sell off part of his stake while maintaining control. That prompted a suit by a group of shareholders who argued that the move would benefit only Zuckerberg while diluting the value of other investors' stakes. The company dropped the plan.

The gambit hints at the complexity of being Zuckerberg, who advocates for transparency and community but whose individual interests don't always align.Zuckerberg, who has 105 million Facebook ""friends,"" is compelled to share far more about himself than would be expected of another CEO. Yet he fiercely guards his privacy.""Intellectually, he believes in transparency,"" Kirkpatrick said. ""But emotionally, it's very difficult for him.""Shortly before the 2016 election, McNamee sent a letter to Zuckerberg and Facebook's chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, warning the company was being manipulated in ways its creators never intended. It wasn't just about the U.S. election: A consulting firm had collected data on people interested in the Black Lives Matter movement and sold it to police departments, and critics had detected a well-organized, clandestine campaign supporting Brexit.McNamee said he has been disappointed in the incremental changes announced since, but Zuckerberg's supporters say he is unfairly blamed.Hoffman, the LinkedIn co-founder, credits him with leading Facebook through a shift in mindset, nudging users into a more positive virtual environment — without completely shutting out inflammatory content.Kirkpatrick argues, though, that Zuckerberg still must deal with existential threats to Facebook's business — its potential to negatively affect democracy and the way it hooks in users.""I do not think he has yet grasped the gravity with which his service is being perceived to be a socially harmful force all around the world. And I also don't think he realizes the extent to which that really is true.""McNamee, recalling Zuckerberg as a 22-year-old visionary, said the CEO must be willing to rethink long-held assumptions. But that does not mean he has to abandon building his global community.

        SAN FRANCISCO —  The quartet of technology stocks that has driven Wall Street indices to record highs in recent years may be breaking up, possibly undermining one of the best growth stories in a nine-year bull market.Facebook and Google-parent Alphabet tumbled this week as the benchmark S&P 500 index fell back toward lows seen in February, when the index gave back more than 10 percent in 10 days after reaching a record high in January.Netflix and Amazon.com, which along with Facebook and Alphabet make up the so-called ""FANG"" stocks, did not do as badly as the S&P 500 index this week, falling 4.0 percent, compared to the index's 6.0 per cent fall.But growing concerns about potential government regulation in the U.S. and Europe in response to privacy issues have investors assessing whether they may be forced to choose between those technology stocks leading the new economy.

        The outcry over Facebook's handling of users' data this week has bled $75 billion from the social media company's stock market value, with concerns about potential regulation of internet companies also hurting Alphabet.Facebook fell 13 percent for the week and is down nearly 20 percent from its record high, while Alphabet lost nearly 10 percent this week and is 14 percent off its record high.Amazon lost nearly 10 percent also for the week but is only 8 percent off its record, while Netflix lost 5.4 percent and is nearly 10 percent from its high.Apple, which became a stock portfolio cornerstone following the iPhone's debut in 2007, is also about 10 percent off its record high.Amazon this week overtook Alphabet as the world's second largest company by market capitalization at around $747 billion compared to $730 billion for Alphabet, but is still behind the largest company Apple worth $860 billion, according to Reuters data.""The FANG complex needs to go away,"" said Joel Kulina, senior vice president of institutional cash equities at Wedbush. ""You can't compare Facebook and Google to Amazon anymore because they're going in different directions and disrupting different parts of the world.""Illustrative of the consumer and political backlash against Facebook, the world's largest social media network, the verified Facebook page of rocket company SpaceX disappeared on Friday, minutes after its founder and Silicon Valley billionaire Elon Musk promised on Twitter to take down the page when challenged by a user.

STILL MOSTLY BULLISHCriticism about the misuse of Facebook and Alphabet's platforms during the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign has worried investors for several months.European governments are already taking action to deal with risks to the privacy of user data, as well to limit what is seen as unfair competition in a move reminiscent of regulatory action against Microsoft nearly 20 years ago.Regulatory risk became a bigger issue this week after the revelation that Facebook mistakenly let 50 million users' data get into the hands of political consultancy Cambridge Analytica.Longer term though investors remain mostly bulllish on all four stocks and this week's privacy scandal has not led analysts to meaningfully change their expectations for Facebook or Alphabet's stocks.Investors disagree about which FANG stocks will lead in the future.Gullane Capital Partners, a hedge fund in Memphis, Tennessee, owns Amazon and Alphabet, and has occasionally shorted Netflix in recent years, betting the streaming company's meteoric rise would be followed by a steep pullback.""I want to own Amazon for the next 25 years. It's the most powerful business since Wal-Mart or Microsoft in their heydays,"" said Gullane Capital Managing Partner Trip Miller.Miller attributed recent selling in Facebook, which his fund does not own, more to profit-taking than to a seismic change in how the company is viewed on Wall Street.The growing divergence in views on the four Wall Street powerhouses comes as investors more broadly reduce their appetite for the technology stocks which have led Wall Street's rally in recent years.

        WASHINGTON —  The House intelligence committee voted Thursday to approve its final report into Russian meddling in the 2016 election, ending its inquiry and giving a final endorsement to the GOP conclusion there was no coordination between Donald Trump's presidential campaign and Russia.The full Republican-written report will be released to the public after intelligence agencies conduct a classification review, which could take weeks.The document is likely to please Trump but is fiercely opposed by committee Democrats, all of whom voted against approving it. The Democrats say the investigation was shut down too quickly and that the committee has not interviewed enough witnesses or gathered enough evidence to make such a definitive assessment.After the vote, Republicans released a summary of 44 findings, including conclusions that there were Russian cyberattacks on U.S. political institutions and that Russians leveraged social media in the U.S. to sow discord. The report echoes GOP criticism of the Justice Department and intelligence agencies.

On the subject of collusion, the report says that ""when asked directly, none of the interviewed witnesses provided evidence of collusion, coordination or conspiracy between the Trump campaign and the Russian government."" The Republicans say they found no evidence that Trump's ""pre-campaign business dealings"" formed any basis for collusion.        Continue reading the main story

        The report also appears to try and clear numerous Trump associates from wrongdoing.The GOP document says there's no evidence Trump associates had anything to do with hacked emails stolen from Democrats during the campaign, though it does mention ""numerous ill-advised contacts with WikiLeaks."" The president's son, Donald Trump Jr., messaged with WikiLeaks during the campaign.An assessment released in January 2017 by U.S. intelligence agencies concluded that Russian military intelligence provided hacked information from the Democratic National Committee and Democratic officials to WikiLeaks. WikiLeaks has denied that Russia was the source of emails it released.The report also concludes there's no evidence Trump Jr. discussed the election with a Russian official he met at an National Rifle Association meeting in 2016, and says the younger Trump and other campaign officials did not receive any derogatory information about Democrat Hillary Clinton at a June 2016 meeting with Russians in Trump Tower. Emails showed that Trump Jr. and others attended that meeting with the expectation of receiving such information.The committee concluded that meetings between the Russian ambassador in Washington and Trump campaign officials, including now-Attorney General Jeff Sessions, did not represent coordination with Russia in any way. Sessions was also interviewed by the committee.The report addresses ""possible Russian efforts to set up a 'back channel'"" with Trump associates after the campaign and implies it couldn't have been nefarious. The Republicans say that if that did happen, it suggests ""the absence of collusion during the campaign, since the communication associated with collusion would have rendered such a 'back channel' unnecessary.""On Carter Page, a onetime Trump campaign official who was the subject of a disputed secret surveillance warrant, the committee concluded that a July 2016 trip to Moscow wasn't on behalf of the Trump campaign. But the findings say the committee is ""concerned about his seemingly incomplete accounts of his activity in Moscow.""Texas Rep. Mike Conaway, the Republican leading the House investigation, said in an interview with The Associated Press that the committee wanted to get the report out as the 2018 campaign season begins.

On collusion and coordination, Conaway said, ""We could not find a thread to follow that made sense.""After the committee vote, the top Democrat, California Rep. Adam Schiff, said he had hoped Thursday's closed-door meeting could have been public.

""It is a rather sad chapter in our committee's long history with the ending of the majority's participation in the investigation, that ending taking place in secret session for no reason at all except a desire to avoid public scrutiny of this decision, to curtail an investigation into one of the most serious intrusions into our democracy and our history,"" Schiff said.Democrats will have their own report and say they will continue to investigate the meddling. They have already set up at least one interview: Chris Wylie, a former employee of a political data-mining firm that obtained information from Facebook users without their consent. The firm, Cambridge Analytica, worked for the Trump campaign.The GOP report also targets the Obama administration, saying officials did not notify the Trump campaign that people associated with it ""were assessed to be potential counterintelligence concerns.""Trump campaign officials identified by intelligence agencies included Page and George Papadopoulos, who has pleaded guilty in special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation to lying about his foreign contacts. The report blames those hires on ""the Republican national security establishment's opposition to candidate Trump"" for ""creating opportunities for two less-experienced individuals with pro-Russia views to serve as campaign advisers.""The Republicans target leaks of classified information before and especially after the election, saying they have potentially endangered lives. It recommends mandatory polygraphs for some people with top secret clearances.In addition, the report targets intelligence agencies for not using ""proper analytic tradecraft"" to assess Russian President Vladimir Putin's intentions in its postelection report. Conaway said last week that investigators had reviewed raw intelligence data and do not believe Putin wanted to help Trump. Conaway later clarified that evidence shows that Putin did want to hurt Clinton in the election.The House Republicans also criticized the FBI for failing to notify targets of Russian espionage, saying the bureau's efforts to alert Americans caught in the hackers' crosshairs had been ""largely inadequate.""The criticism comes after the AP revealed that only a tiny fraction of the hundreds of Americans singled out by Russian hackers had received any kind of heads up from the bureau — despite the FBI long having had details of the digital spying campaign.___Read the House intelligence committee's findings: http://apne.ws/TTEhitG___Associated Press Writer Raphael Satter contributed to this report from London.

"200","Don’t Delete Facebook. Do Something About It.","AdvertisementSunday ReviewSupported byOpinionDon’t Delete Facebook. Do Something About It.ImageCreditJosh Edelson/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesBy Siva VaidhyanathanMarch 24, 2018On March 16, as the buzzer sounded in perhaps the worst upset in N.C.A.A. tournament history, and my beloved University of Virginia went down to the 16th-seeded University of Maryland, Baltimore County, I had one thought: I need to deactivate my Facebook account. I did not want to endure the taunts and trash talk of my friends who cheer for Duke.I do this often. When I need to focus on a project or relax a bit, I turn off the noise that comes from Facebook — the constant stream of disturbing faces, angry comments and shallow pulls on my precious attention. I also lose the lovely pictures of puppies and babies. But sometimes it’s worth it to retreat from the addictive torrent of stimuli framed in blue.If you feel the same way about how Facebook affects your daily life, by all means suspend or even delete your account (not that Facebook makes it easy to). But don’t pretend it will make a difference to Facebook or to the state of the world.A Twitter movement known as #DeleteFacebook is motivated by the stream of terrible things that Facebook has been involved in, including the proliferation of hate speech, harassment and propaganda meant to undermine trust in democratic institutions. The final spark was the news that the British political data firm Cambridge Analytica had acquired Facebook data on 50 million Americans.But even if tens of thousands of Americans quit Facebook tomorrow, the company would barely feel it. Facebook has more than 2.1 billion users worldwide. Its growth has plateaued in the United States, but the service is gaining millions of new users outside North America every week. Like most global companies, Facebook focuses its attention on markets like India, Egypt, Indonesia, the Philippines, Brazil and Mexico. At current rates of growth, it could reach three billion users by 2020.People in those countries are getting value out of Facebook; in some places, it’s one of the few reliable ways to keep in touch. In much of the developing world, Facebook is also the only news source that matters. This should horrify us. But it’s not a problem that will be solved by indignant Americans leaving the service.Moreover, quitting Facebook lets Google and Twitter off the hook. It lets AT&T and Comcast and its peers off the hook. The dangers of extremist propaganda and hate speech are just as grave on YouTube, which is owned by Google. Russian agents undermining trust in institutions and democracy are even more visible on Twitter. And every major telecommunications firm, as well as Google and Twitter, relies on surveillance systems similar to the one Facebook uses to run targeted advertising. Facebook is bigger and better at all of this than the others, but its problems are not unique.Facebook’s problems are not peripheral, not just some rough edges that can be sanded down. Its core functions are to deploy its algorithms to amplify content that generates strong emotional responses among its users, and then convert what it learns about our interests and desires into targeted ads. This is what makes Facebook Facebook. This is also what makes Facebook such an effective vehicle for promoting so much garbage and what makes it the most pervasive personal surveillance system in the world. As long as that’s true, don’t expect Facebook to fix itself.Hope lies, instead, with our power as citizens. We must demand that legislators and regulators get tougher. They should go after Facebook on antitrust grounds. Facebook is by far the dominant social platform in the United States, with 68 percent of American adults using it, according to the Pew Research Center. That means Facebook can gobble up potential competitors, as it already has with Instagram, and crowd out upstarts in fields such as artificial intelligence and virtual reality.The Department of Justice should consider severing WhatsApp, Instagram and Messenger from Facebook, much as it broke up AT&T in 1982. That breakup unleashed creativity, improved phone service and lowered prices. It also limited the political power of AT&T.The European Union has already stepped up its legal efforts to protect data. Its General Data Protection Regulation, which goes into effect in May, is intended to ensure that users understand and consent to data collection and how that data is used. Users won’t have to agree to give access to their data to start using a product.As with some recent American consumer finance regulations, data collection policies under the new European Union rules must be clear, concise and in plain language. Companies will have to declare up front how they will use the data, and users can withdraw consent at any time. This should significantly deter many abuses that companies like Facebook and Google have committed. It won’t repair the sins of the past. But it’s something.Regulatory interventions have limitations. As long as Facebook is big and rich, its algorithms will determine and distort much of what we read and watch. Our long-term agenda should be to bolster institutions that foster democratic deliberation and the rational pursuit of knowledge. These include scientific organizations, universities, libraries, museums, newspapers and civic organizations. They have all been enfeebled over recent years as our resources and attention have shifted to the tiny addictive devices in our hands.If we act together as citizens to champion these changes, we have a chance to curb the problems that Facebook has amplified. If we act as disconnected, indignant moral agents, we surrender the only power we have: the power to think and act collectively. We could even use Facebook to mount campaigns to rein in Facebook. It is, after all, a powerful tool for motivation, even if it’s a terrible tool for deliberation.So go ahead and quit Facebook if it makes you feel calmer or more productive. Please realize, though, that you might be offloading problems onto those who may have less opportunity to protect privacy and dignity and are more vulnerable to threats to democracy. If the people who care the most about privacy, accountability and civil discourse evacuate Facebook in disgust, the entire platform becomes even less informed and diverse. Deactivation is the opposite of activism.Siva Vaidhyanathan is a professor of media studies at the University of Virginia and the author of the forthcoming book “Antisocial Media: How Facebook Disconnects Us and Undermines Democracy.” Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter (@NYTopinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.

        NEW YORK —  Stock indexes finished mostly higher after a day of bouncing around Tuesday as retailers, energy companies and banks recovered some of their losses from the day before, but technology companies struggled as Facebook dropped again.Amazon led a rally among retailers, and it passed Alphabet, Google's parent, as the second most-valuable U.S.-listed company, while energy companies rose with oil prices. Banks rose along with interest rates as the leaders of the Federal Reserve met. They are expected to raise interest rates on Wednesday.Facebook sank following reports that the Federal Trade Commission will investigate its handling of user data while authorities in the U.S. and U.K. demanded answers from the company. That came after reports that Cambridge Analytica, a data mining firm working for President Donald Trump's campaign, improperly obtained data on 50 million Facebook users without their permission.While Facebook stock regained a portion of its losses at the end of the day, it has fallen more than 9 percent this week. Social media companies Twitter and Snap also fell as investors considered the possibility that the government will pass new laws affecting their businesses.

        The gainers Tuesday were mostly larger companies, which suffered the biggest losses Monday. Smaller companies struggled and more stocks fell than rose on the New York Stock Exchange.After a drop of 1.4 percent Monday, the S&P 500 index rose 4.02 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,716.94. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 116.36 points, or 0.5 percent, to 24,727.27. The Nasdaq composite rose 20.06 points, or 0.3 percent, to 7,364.30. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks dipped 0.16 points to 1,570.41.Amazon jumped $41.58, or 2.7 percent, to $1,586.51 and Best Buy picked up $1.51, or 2.2 percent, to $70.04. Industrial companies including Caterpillar recovered much of their losses as well. Some major technology companies including Apple, Microsoft and Nvidia moved higher after significant drops a day ago.Facebook lost $4.41, or 2.6 percent, to $168.15. The drop in the last two days is the worst for Facebook in two years, and it knocked Facebook from its perch as the fifth most valuable publicly traded company in the U.S. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate, which owns insurance companies and railroads among many others, moved ahead of Facebook.Other social media companies also sank: after sharp losses Monday, Twitter plunged $3.63, or 10.4 percent, to $31.35 and Snap lost 42 cents, or 2.6 percent, to $16. Alphabet, which fell 3 percent Monday, lost another $4.27 to $1,095.80.Investors were disappointed with Oracle's third-quarter report. While the company announced a bigger profit than analysts expected, they were less impressed once items like lower tax rates and stock repurchases were excluded, and its sales were lower than Wall Street had forecast. The company's forecast for the fourth quarter also came up short of estimates. The stock dropped $4.90, or 9.4 percent, to $47.05.

The Federal Reserve's leaders began a two-day policy meeting that is expected to result in another interest rate increase on Wednesday. The Fed has said it expects to raise interest rates a total of three times this year, and one of the key debates on Wall Street is whether it will wind up increasing rates three times or four. The current meeting is the Fed's first since Jerome Powell became chairman, and investors will be watching his comments at a press conference Wednesday afternoon.""Markets right now are hypersensitive to the Fed,"" said Azzarello of JPMorgan. She said the Fed is trying to communicate clearly with investors and it won't rush to raise interest rates.

When yields rise, it allows banks to charge higher interest rates on loans including mortgages.Banks and other financial companies rose, while companies that pay large dividends, including phone and utility companies, moved lower. Those stocks tend to fall out of favor with income-seeking investors when bond yields rise.Benchmark U.S. crude rose $1.34, or 2.2 percent, to $63.40 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, gained $1.37, or 2.1 percent, to $67.42 per barrel in London.Wholesale gasoline gained 4 cents to $1.97 a gallon.

“Silicon Valley” returns to HBO Sunday after a particularly terrible week for Silicon Valley, as Facebook dealt with fallout from revelations about the Cambridge Analytica data breach and Uber notched a horrific milestone: The first pedestrian killed by a driverless car.“The tech world of four or five years ago is definitely different than now,” said Mike Judge, the creator of the show. The public conception of Silicon Valley as a place of whiz kids in hoodies “boldly claiming all the time that they were making the world a better place” has been replaced with something darker, he said.For its fifth season, TV’s “Silicon Valley” has undergone changes of its own, albeit of the less tragic variety. The largely luckless Pied Piper crew finally finds itself in charge, as well as a man down. T. J. Miller, the excitable comic who played the feckless blowhard Erlich Bachman, last seen in a Tibetan opium den in Season 4, left the show, bashing colleagues in interviews on the way out. (In December, after Mr. Miller had quit the series, he was the subject of sexual assault allegations involving a former college classmate; he has denied the allegations.)Mr. Judge was previously best known for creating the long-running “King of the Hill” as well as diverse cult favorites that have had equally lengthy afterlives, like “Beavis and Butt-Head,” “Office Space” and “Idiocracy.” The new direction of “Silicon Valley,” along with the changes and struggles in the tech world, has him reassessing his original plan to end the show after six seasons. “It’s taken on a second wind,” he said.

            In a phone conversation, Mr. Judge discussed the new season, Mr. Miller’s departure, possible reboots of “King of the Hill” and “Idiocracy” and which of his creations are his favorites. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.For the first time, the Pied Piper crew is running things. Did that change how you approached the story?

It felt pretty natural. In a way, some of this to me is analogous to stuff that happens in Hollywood. I started out making animated shorts in my house by myself. Then when “Beavis and Butt-Head” happened, I had people fighting over it — there was the stress of, am I getting screwed here? And eventually I had about as many people working for me on “Beavis and Butt-Head” as Richard [Thomas Middleditch] does in Season 5, and that became just as stressful. I’m not someone who enjoys telling people to do something they don’t want to do, and Richard is the same way. So there’s plenty of comedy that can come from stuff like that.How did T. J. Miller’s departure affect the show?Had he left after Season 1 or 2, it would have been really rough to try to make it work. But now it’s actually kind of perfect timing because we were having trouble keeping him in the story. Not because of him, just because his character is not a programmer. He’s just the guy who owned the house. We had done a bunch of comedy about that, about how he’s kind of marginal and trying to make himself relevant. We have a lot of really great characters and actors, and I try to service them all. So it actually freed us up in the writing. [Mr. Judge declined to comment on reports that Mr. Miller had been a disruptive presence on the set.]What did you make of his bomb-throwing exit? [Laughs.] It seemed very much like T. J. — I’m sure he wouldn’t have it any other way. He’s a brilliantly funny guy. I’ve seen these quotes — he’s always been a good put-down artist. But yeah, I don’t know what to really make of it, and it’s not any of my business anymore, you know?Jian-Yang [Jimmy O. Yang] has been the new [expletive] of the house for a while, and he becomes a bigger one, like on a grander scale. And there are a lot of other characters picking up the slack. Laurie [Suzanne Cryer], there’s more of her and Monica [Amanda Crew]. There’s definitely a lot more Jared [Zach Woods]. And we’ve got a really great robot coming up.The show started off making fun of the goofy grandiosity of the tech industry, but the current perception of Silicon Valley is more critical. Has the show changed as a result?

Because we write it several months ahead of when it airs, we were already kind of noticing, just because we talk to a lot of people [in the industry] and a lot of them are just starting to realize the lack of conscience. And if they’re not realizing that, people are pointing it out to them. I noticed when I worked in the tech world that there’s just this belief that every gain they make is for the good of mankind, and never really questioning it. I’m not saying they’re all horrible people, but they look at the task at hand and don’t really consider whether it’s right or wrong.Or whether people want their data to be sold to political operatives.Yeah, and actually we deal with that this season, with what Richard’s building. It’s like that quote: If you’re getting the service for free, then you’re the product. Those servers and all the infrastructure and engineers cost money. So, you’re paying by them looking for keywords in your email and popping ads up.Which is familiar to anyone who’s had a sneaker ad follow them around online.Yeah a friend of mine told me through text message what hotel he was going to be staying at in Nashville, and the next thing I know, there’s an ad for it on my Facebook page. It’s all tied together.Fox has said it wants to bring back “King of the Hill.” Would you be involved in that?Yeah, if they did. There have been a couple discussions about it, and about how we would do it, but nothing concrete yet. I think you’d have to have Bobby and all of them be older. The Simpsons are such iconic characters; Bart could be that age forever because it’s a more surreal show. But with “King of the Hill” being on 13 years, I think people were really starting to wonder why Bobby’s still the same age.

Another old film of yours, “Idiocracy,” from 2006, has become a common reference point for, well, many things happening right now. Do people mention this to you?On Twitter, like all day long. There was at one point talk about possibly a series, an animated series, a reboot like that. There were talks of musicals. I would like to have another stab at it one way or another. It was almost like a bigger concept than it was a movie — it was difficult to make and probably should have been a TV show. But yeah, I get it all the time, which is nice. But I don’t really know what to make of it, or how much of it relates to the movie when people throw around the word “idiocracy” on Twitter.Well when the C.E.O. of Carl’s Jr. gets nominated for a cabinet position —That’s what was really weird for me, specific things like that. There’s Carl’s Jr. [The company had a notably unflattering presence in the film.] There was the W.W.E. thing. [The president in the movie was a former professional wrestler; in real life, President Trump appeared in a World Wrestling Entertainment match in 2007.]Even when we were shooting the movie, the wardrobe designer showed me these shoes — they weren’t out in the world yet. And she said, “This is a start-up, they’re making these shoes and they’re going to look completely ridiculous.” Plastic shoes with holes in them. And I said to her, “The only thing I’m worried about is, what if these things blow up and by the time the movie comes out, they’re everywhere?” And she said, “Oh, that’s never going to happen. No one is going to buy these things.” And then, the movie comes out, and they are all wearing Crocs, and those shoes were just becoming huge. So, I think that was a sign that maybe a lot of these dumb things are going to come to pass.It was the Croc in the coal mine.[Laughs.] Oh man.You have a remarkable track record of creating things that seem to stick with people, whether it’s “Idiocracy” or “Office Space” or characters like Hank and Bobby Hill. Do you have a personal favorite?That’s a hard one to pick. I’m probably a little partial to Beavis. Beavis and Butt-Head, but mostly Beavis. I’d say Lumbergh [from “Office Space”] is another one. I’d say those two probably come to mind the most because … well, I don’t know.Well for Lumbergh — I’m old enough to remember when an office job sounded great. I worked at Jack in the Box and worked construction, those kinds of jobs, and I remember thinking, “Oh my God, you can work in an office? That would be wonderful.” And then the first time I did it, I had that type of boss — that passive-aggressive boss. I would rather have a guy yelling at me on a construction site. I had done an animated version but the way Gary Cole played that character, I thought that was something really great that hadn’t been done yet. So, I don’t know. I’m pretty proud of that one.

John R. Bolton is hardly known for sugarcoating his views. He once derided the United Nations by citing its 38-story headquarters in New York. “If it lost 10 stories,” he said, “it wouldn’t make a bit of difference.”As it happened, Mr. Bolton went on to serve as the United States ambassador to the United Nations, perhaps the most undiplomatic of diplomats. But if President Trump wanted a national security adviser who would match his blunt, hard-edge, confrontational approach to the world, then Mr. Bolton fits the bill.With his trademark bushy gray mustache and his take-no-prisoners style, Mr. Bolton positioned himself to the right even of the foreign policy veterans who emerged from President George W. Bush’s administration, a hawk among hawks, a hard-liner who thrills conservatives and chills moderates and liberals. From his perch on Fox News, he has impressed Mr. Trump with a muscular vision of American power and a dark assessment of America’s adversaries.When he takes over as Mr. Trump’s third national security adviser in 14 months, Mr. Bolton will almost surely encourage Mr. Trump’s instincts against diplomatic agreements both consider weak and unwise. He shares the president’s derisive opinion of the Iran nuclear deal and will presumably prod him to scrap it when a May deadline arrives. He likewise takes a dim view of international agreements like the Paris climate change accord, from which Mr. Trump announced last year that he would withdraw the United States. He has called the “two-state solution” for Israel and the Palestinians dead.

But Mr. Bolton is not always in step with a president who sometimes veers back and forth between threatening “fire and fury” and eagerly seeking talks with foreign leaders. Mr. Bolton argues the virtues of pre-emptive military action against North Korea and scorns diplomacy of the sort Mr. Trump has embarked on with Kim Jong-un. He promotes more punitive sanctions against Russia rather than the kind of hand-holding flattery of President Vladimir V. Putin that Mr. Trump practiced even this week. He supported the Iraq war, which Mr. Trump calls a catastrophic mistake.        Continue reading the main story

        In an interview on Thursday evening on Fox, Mr. Bolton said he recognized that his role would be to play the honest broker bringing different views to the president, and that it would be up to Mr. Trump to make the decisions.But he made clear that he also planned to be Mr. Trump’s enforcer. When the president makes a decision, he said, part of his job will be “making sure the bureaucracies get the decision and implement it.”Mr. Bolton criticized the frequent leaks out of Mr. Trump’s national security team, saying that a president cannot conduct diplomacy “if some munchkin in the White House” is leaking information to the news media. “Leaking of that sort is simply unacceptable,” he said.Mr. Bolton’s appointment elicited mixed reviews. “Selecting John Bolton as national security adviser is good news for America’s allies and bad news for America’s enemies,” said Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina. “He has a firm understanding of the threats we face from North Korea, Iran and radical Islam.”Critics, however, expressed concern that a bomb thrower in words could become a bomb thrower in deeds. “Bolton played a key role in politicizing the intel that misled us into the Iraq War,” Senator Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, wrote on Twitter. “We cannot let this extreme war hawk blunder us into another terrible conflict.”Clifford Kupchan, the chairman of the Eurasia Group, a consultant firm, sent a note to clients warning that Mr. Bolton’s appointment “increases risk across the board,” adding that it “makes U.S. foreign policy ‘America First on Steroids.’”At one point, Mr. Bolton toyed with running for president himself, only to back off. Instead, he created an organization to support like-minded candidates. His “super PAC” was one of the earliest customers of Cambridge Analytica, which has found itself confronting a deepening crisis after reports last weekend that the firm had harvested the data from more than 50 million Facebook profiles in its bid to develop techniques for predicting the behavior of individual American voters.

The firm was founded with a $15 million investment from Robert Mercer, the wealthy Republican donor who has backed both Mr. Bolton’s PAC and Mr. Trump. Cambridge’s so-called psychographic modeling techniques, which were built in part with the data harvested from Facebook, underpinned its work for the Trump campaign in 2016, setting off a furious debate about the merits of the firm’s methods. The same techniques were also the focus of its work for Mr. Bolton’s PAC.Using the psychographic models, the company designed advertisements from candidates supported by Mr. Bolton’s PAC, including the 2014 campaign of Thom Tillis, the Republican senator from North Carolina. One advertisement, a video that was posted on YouTube, was aimed at fearful and neurotic voters — it emphasized security and the idea that Mr. Tillis could keep the United States safe.

Mr. Bolton also recorded a video used by a Russian gun rights group in 2013 to encourage Moscow to loosen gun laws, according to a report by NPR. The report said the video was part of an effort by Russian and American gun rights groups to collaborate in the years leading up to the 2016 election.A native of Baltimore, Mr. Bolton, 69, received undergraduate and law degrees from Yale University. In between stints in private practice, he took a series of increasingly important jobs in government, starting at the United States Agency for International Development under President Ronald Reagan and later as an assistant attorney general.After the 2000 election, Mr. Bolton joined the Republican legal team in Florida during the recount battle between Mr. Bush and Vice President Al Gore. After the Supreme Court halted the recount, resulting in Mr. Bush’s victory, Dick Cheney, the new vice president, persuaded the incoming secretary of state, Colin L. Powell, to make Mr. Bolton an under secretary in charge of arms control. In that role, he helped pull the United States out of the Antiballistic Missile treaty but negotiated a separate treaty with Russia paring nuclear arsenals.When Condoleezza Rice succeeded Mr. Powell, she rebuffed pressure from Mr. Cheney to make Mr. Bolton her deputy. Instead, Mr. Bush nominated him for the United Nations post, but key Republicans opposed him, including a former assistant secretary of state who testified that Mr. Bolton was a “kiss-up, kick-down sort of guy” who abused underlings.After the Senate refused to confirm Mr. Bolton, Mr. Bush gave him a recess appointment instead — a decision he would come to regret. Mr. Bolton clashed regularly with Ms. Rice and, after leaving office, broke with Mr. Bush over what he saw as weak-kneed policies on North Korea and Iran.He titled his memoir “Surrender Is Not an Option,” and called the Foreign Service officers in the State Department’s East Asian and Pacific Affairs Bureau the “EAPeasers.” He even went after Mr. Bush. “Nothing can erase the ineffable sadness of an American presidency, like this one, in total intellectual collapse,” he wrote in The Wall Street Journal.Mr. Bush bristled and, in a private meeting with a group of conservatives, said, “Let me just say from the outset that I don’t consider Bolton credible.” Other former colleagues fought back more publicly. Christopher Hill, who negotiated with North Korea for Mr. Bush, dismissed Mr. Bolton as “Phyllis Schlafly with a mustache.”

Hadley, the former national security adviser, privately warned against an appointment for Mr. Bolton.Mr. Trump considered Mr. Bolton for several posts but ultimately backed away each time. Unlike some of them, national security adviser does not require Senate confirmation. In the interim, Mr. Bolton has repeatedly praised Mr. Trump on television and in his Wall Street Journal columns even when the two disagreed.He wrote on Twitter this month that sanctions on Mr. Putin and his inner circle needed to be tougher. “If you want to punish a country for behavior you don’t accept, you need punishing sanctions that are broad, not targeted, and they need to be enforced,” he wrote.In a Journal column, he made the case for a pre-emptive military strike against North Korea. “Given the gaps in U.S. intelligence about North Korea, we should not wait until the very last minute,” he wrote. “That would risk striking after the North has deliverable nuclear weapons, a much more dangerous situation.” Other options, he told a reporter, would be persuading China to topple North Korea’s government or reuniting the peninsula under South Korean rule, although he acknowledged neither was likely.A couple of weeks ago, he went on Fox to disdain South Korea’s willingness to negotiate with North Korea. “They’re like putty in North Korea’s hands,” he said. “As the great international relations theorist P. T. Barnum put it, there’s a sucker born every minute.” Two days later, Mr. Trump accepted an invitation to meet with North Korea’s Mr. Kim.As he prepared to take on his new assignment, however, Mr. Bolton was careful to minimize any differences with Mr. Trump. Asked Thursday evening on Fox about the president’s decision to congratulate Mr. Putin on winning an election that most of the world considered a sham, Mr. Bolton said, “I don’t consider it a significant point one way or the other,” adding, “it’s a matter of being polite.”

        As questions mounted last year about whether Facebook had been exploited to tilt the U.S. presidential election, Mark Zuckerberg's to-do list landed him on a fishing trawler off Alabama's Gulf coast.But the chatter surrounding the CEO's arrival in port was that it signaled something bigger than just the start of a 30-state personal tour: his designs on a job even more powerful than leading the social network that links 2.2 billion people worldwide.""It was one of the last things I asked him, thinking it would put a smile on his face — and it did,"" said Dominick Ficarino, who owns a shrimp business in Bayou La Batre, Alabama, and hosted a dockside lunch for Zuckerberg that Sunday afternoon.""I asked him if he was interested in running for president of the United States. And his answer to me was: 'Can I answer you with a question? If you were me, would you?'""

Thirteen months later, Zuckerberg no longer has the luxury of mulling a hypothetical next act. Instead, he is grappling with a crisis that has enveloped the company synonymous with his face and name. It does not help that the most glaring reminder of Facebook's flaws is the unabated uproar over the American presidency itself.        Continue reading the main story

        ""The world feels anxious and divided, and Facebook has a lot of work to do,"" Zuckerberg wrote in January, laying out the ""personal challenge"" that he sets for himself each year.In 2017, the billionaire challenged himself to travel to every state he'd never visited. This year, long after critics began demanding an overhaul, Zuckerberg said his personal goal is to ""fix"" the platform that he has engineered to build community — but that is increasingly blamed for warping it.Yet things continue to get worse. Scrutiny of Facebook has intensified following reports that it failed to prevent the data-mining firm Cambridge Analytica from amassing personal information about millions of users — possibly used to aid Donald Trump's campaign — and that the social network has been collecting Android users' phone call and text message histories without notice. That adds to criticism that Facebook manipulates its users and has allowed Russian bots to divide Americans by spreading false information.On Monday, the Federal Trade Commission announced it was investigating Facebook for its privacy practices.Throughout the mounting crisis, Zuckerberg's response has been a study in contradictions. He crisscrossed the country, even as his company back home came under increasing fire. He preaches transparency, but flinches at questioning and craves privacy. He is undeniably brilliant, but stubborn in his reluctance to acknowledge the extent of Facebook's problems.Even his critics say he is uniquely capable of righting the ship. But at 33, is he prepared to do all it will take?""If he fails to do it, it may take a while but eventually people are going to rebel,"" said Roger McNamee, an early Facebook investor and adviser who has become one of the company's most pointed critics.

""I thought Facebook was a force for good in the world for a really long time,"" McNamee said. ""I think it's really hard to make that case today.""___Days after Trump's election, Zuckerberg was pressed on the possibility that foreign agents had used his social network to divide voters.""The idea that fake news on Facebook ... influenced the election in any way, I think, is a pretty crazy idea,"" the CEO told the audience at a California technology conference.""I think all of us were shocked to learn how wrong he was,"" said David Kirkpatrick, the author of a 2010 book about Facebook who questioned Zuckerberg that day. ""You can certainly say that he was culpable, in that he was naive and inattentive to what was happening in his system. But I don't think he was lying.""Zuckerberg walked back the remark soon after, continuing a years-long routine of self-correction. But errors that reflect his stubbornness, those who know him say, are tempered by an eagerness to learn from mistakes and a deep sense of reflection.Donald Graham, the former chairman of the Washington Post Co., recalled that when he met Zuckerberg in 2005, outsiders still weren't sure what to make of Facebook.""I would ask him a question and he would pause long enough — 15 seconds, 20 seconds — that I would think 'Did I insult him? Did he not hear me?'"" said Graham, who went on to serve on the company's board from 2008 to 2015.""Since I am from Washington, I'm not used to people thinking before they are answering a question. ... But Mark, then as now, was thinking about the right answer.""

Zuckerberg's boyish appearance, even today, is a reminder of just how young he was when he created what would become the world's biggest social network, back in his dorm room at Harvard.""I didn't know anything about building a company or global internet service,"" he wrote in January. ""Over the years I've made almost every mistake you can imagine.""Naomi Gleit, Facebook's longest-serving employee after the CEO, said Zuckerberg — who declined an interview request from The Associated Press — has been talking about making the world a better place since he was 21. But his view of that world and his place in it ""seemed almost like a gravity, a burden of responsibility,"" she said.That seriousness coincides with a sense of certainty.Gleit recalled Zuckerberg's steadfast attachment to a Facebook message service similar to email, even as more people began using phones to send text messages. But co-workers eventually swayed the CEO, whom she described as a ""learn-it-all."" That change-of-mind informed Facebook's 2014 purchase of the WhatsApp messaging service for $19 billion.""I think he would even say now that he was initially wrong,"" Gleit said.With Zuckerberg, ""it's experiment, learn, experiment, learn,"" said LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, who has known him since 2004. Hoffman said that is evident in Zuckerberg's enthusiasm for software, which can be overwritten to fix problems. That facility, he said, makes Zuckerberg the equal of executives with far more experience.But in the process of learning, Zuckerberg's inexperience has sometimes played out in public view.___In 2010, Zuckerberg announced on Oprah Winfrey's television show that he would donate $100 million to schools in Newark, New Jersey.Critics labeled it an attempt to polish his image, just as the biopic ""The Social Network"" was being released. Still, there was little questioning his generosity. The problem was that Zuckerberg — who knew little about education — made the gift with few specifics outlining how it should be spent.

""He was just a very young, naive, inexperienced guy who was brilliant at technology and computers and the internet, but just really didn't know much about how the world worked,"" said Dale Russakoff, author of ""The Prize,"" a book chronicling how the money went to high-priced consultants, with minimal effort by leaders to build community support.By the end of the process, Zuckerberg had developed a clearer understanding of how to get things done. He and his wife, Dr. Priscilla Chan, have since chartered their own foundation and structured it to take on mammoth goals, like a $3 billion investment to cure, prevent or manage all diseases. He has pledged to donate 99 percent of his Facebook stock to philanthropy.""Zuck's maturation has occurred in front of the public,"" said Kirkpatrick, author of ""The Facebook Effect: The Inside Story of the Company that Is Connecting the World."" ''But he also still lives with the consequences of the decisions he made when he was less mature.""At Facebook, Zuckerberg has grown increasingly bold in using huge sums of money to pursue corporate goals, which includes purchasing competitors — or companies that could grow into competitors.

Facebook's $1 billion purchase of Instagram in 2012 — then unprofitable and little-known — came as a shock to Wall Street. Two years later came the multibillion-dollar deal to buy WhatsApp, a company that remains unprofitable but has given Facebook a prime portal into developing countries and other regions outside the U.S.In 2014, soon after Facebook bought a virtual reality firm called Oculus, Zuckerberg found himself being grilled in a lawsuit brought by a competitor who accused an Oculus executive of stealing trade secrets. Under questioning, he talked about the pressure he exerted to make the Oculus deal happen, and his vision of growing it so fast ""that we can get every developer and studio in the world building just for Oculus before any big competitor exists.""Last year, in a bid to free up his fortune for philanthropy, Zuckerberg pushed board members to restructure Facebook's stock, allowing him to sell off part of his stake while maintaining control. That prompted a suit by a group of shareholders who argued that the move would benefit only Zuckerberg while diluting the value of other investors' stakes. Days before Zuckerberg was scheduled to testify as part of the suit, the company dropped the plan.The gambit hints at the complexity of being Zuckerberg, who advocates for transparency and the interests of the community but whose individual interests don't always align.The paradox is self-inflicted, the trade-off for creating a venture premised on users' willingness to share details of their lives. That requires Zuckerberg, who has 105 million Facebook ""friends,"" to reveal far more about himself than would be expected of any other CEO, whether it's photos of him and Chan baking sweets for the Jewish holiday of Purim or dressing their daughters for the Chinese New Year.

Yet he fiercely guards his privacy.When calls went out last year for Zuckerberg to testify before a Senate committee, the company sent its lawyer. And when he and Chan bought 700 acres on the Hawaiian island of Kauai last year, they quietly filed lawsuits against hundreds of Hawaiians — withdrawn after protests — that would have cut off locals' access to the land by negating their interest in small ancestral tracts within the estate's boundaries.""Intellectually, he believes in transparency,"" Kirkpatrick said. ""But emotionally, it's very difficult for him.""____Facebook works hard to present Zuckerberg as someone deeply interested in the ordinary people whose lives are at the heart of its business.Stops on last year's U.S. tour, never announced, were set up by facilitators who revealed details to only a select few. But many of the visits were covered by the media and documented in professional-quality photos on Zuckerberg's Facebook page soon after he'd departed.Ostensibly, the idea was for Zuckerberg to learn. But in their brief interactions, many people were just as interested in finding a way to connect with him.In Hazard, Kentucky, educator Paul Green became custodian of the small town's biggest secret. A staffer from Zuckerberg's foundation, peppering Green with questions about the region's educational cooperative, finally admitted it was because the CEO himself wanted to visit. Green's reward for keeping it quiet was seeing the wide-eyed grins when Zuckerberg pulled up and greeted local high schoolers studying robotics and programming.Walking through science demonstrations, Zuckerberg spent more time trading tech tales with the teenagers than quizzing the teachers.""He just lit up with those kids,"" Green said. ""The way he talked with them about some of the things he did when he was in school and his passion for technology, it really was cool.""

When Zuckerberg toured an oil rig near Williston, North Dakota, last July, ""from the minute he got out of the car to the minute he got back in the car, he was nothing but questions,"" said Ron Ness, president of the North Dakota Petroleum Council, which arranged the visit.""I had Bakken shale, limestone, dolomite, and he was able to hold them in his hand, along with a bottle of crude oil. And I remember him asking, 'How do you get that oil out of that rock?'"" geologist Kathleen Neset said.In Dayton, Ohio, Zuckerberg met with officials, caregivers and families battling drug addiction. Lori Erion, the founder of the group Families of Addicts, said she told him what it was like to learn her daughter, April, had shot up heroin in their own home.""It seemed to get him really emotional,"" Erion said, recalling how Zuckerberg stood up suddenly and told the group he needed a few minutes to steady himself. When he returned, he asked what makes an addict stay clean and how families got their loved ones into treatment.""We didn't ever talk about Facebook at all,"" Erion said, ""which is really interesting because Facebook is really the main way of us getting information out. He really was just like a regular person.""___As Zuckerberg connected with Americans face-to-face, controversy over Facebook continued to spiral.Shortly before the election, McNamee sent a letter to Zuckerberg and Facebook's chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, warning that Facebook was being manipulated in ways its creators never intended. It wasn't just about the U.S. election: A consulting firm had collected data on people interested in the Black Lives Matter movement and sold it to police departments, and critics had detected a well-organized, clandestine campaign supporting Brexit.All this pointed to a deep problem with Facebook — that it was simply not equipped or not willing to prevent the misuse of its platform.

McNamee said he has been disappointed in the incremental changes announced since.Facebook has adopted this ""libertarian philosophy that says 'we are not responsible for anything downstream, we are allowed to disrupt media, we are allowed to addict our users and we are not responsible for any of the consequences of any of that,'"" he said.Zuckerberg could change that. But McNamee said it is not enough to hire thousands of workers to weed through fake and abusive posts if those posts keep getting through. And tweaking Facebook's newsfeed so users see more posts from families and friends does not address his certainty that the algorithms underlying Facebook make it dangerously addictive.""You cannot cure addiction by doing more of the thing that got you addicted in the first place, which is what Zuck recommends,"" McNamee wrote in an email.Critics say Facebook continues to ignore the possibility of the social network being used for dark purposes, but Zuckerberg's supporters counter that he is unfairly blamed for problems he could not have foreseen.Hoffman, the LinkedIn co-founder, credits Zuckerberg with leading Facebook through a shift in mindset, making changes that will nudge users into a more positive virtual environment — without completely shutting out inflammatory content.""Facebook basically is saying we enable people based on the way they behave. That's a very democratic argument. If people want to live in filter bubbles, who are we to say 'Don't live in filter bubbles,' even though we don't want them to?"" Hoffman said.But Kirkpatrick argued that Zuckerberg's and Sandberg's surety that Facebook has a positive impact on society has blinded them to parallel realities. The company can't be fixed, Kirkpatrick said, until Zuckerberg comes to terms with existential threats to the way the social network does business — its potential to negatively affect democracy and the way it hooks in users.""There's no question in my mind that Mark Zuckerberg is an ethical and responsible human being who wants to do the right thing,"" he said. ""However, I do not think he has yet grasped the gravity with which his service is being perceived to be a socially harmful force all around the world. And I also don't think he realizes the extent to which that really is true.""McNamee, recalling Zuckerberg as a 22-year-old visionary, said the CEO must be willing to rethink long-held assumptions. But that does not mean he has to abandon building his global community.

""You've won,"" McNamee said he would tell Zuckerberg if asked again for his counsel.""You've achieved more than your wildest dreams. You're a billionaire. Now you have a chance to be a hero.""        Continue reading the main story

MENLO PARK, Calif. — John Tenanes, Facebook’s vice president for real estate, is showing off the company’s plans for expansion. It will have offices for thousands of programmers to extend Facebook’s fearsome reach. But that is not what Mr. Tenanes is excited about.He leans over a scale model of the 59-acre site, which is named Willow Village. “There will be housing there,” he points. “There will be a retail street along here, with a grocery store and a drugstore. That round building in the corner? Maybe a cultural center.”In just a few years, Facebook built a virtual community that linked more than two billion people, an achievement with few precedents. Now the social network is building a real community, the kind you can walk around. It is a project with many precedents in American history, quite a few of them cautionary tales about what happens when a powerful corporation takes control of civic life.Facebook, Mr. Tenanes says, has a dual mission: “We want to balance our growth with the community’s needs.”        Continue reading the main story

Willow Village will be wedged between the Menlo Park neighborhood of Belle Haven and the city of East Palo Alto, both heavily Hispanic communities that are among Silicon Valley’s poorest. Facebook is planning 1,500 apartments, and has agreed with Menlo Park to offer 225 of them at below-market rates. The most likely tenants of the full-price units are Facebook employees, who already receive a five-figure bonus if they live near the office.

The community will have eight acres of parks, plazas and bike-pedestrian paths open to the public. Facebook wants to revitalize the railway running alongside the property and will finish next year a pedestrian bridge over the expressway. The bridge will provide access to the trail that rings San Francisco Bay, a boon for birders and bikers.Mr. Tenanes contemplates the audacity of building a city.“It’s a good thing, right?” he says.Depends how it goes. Facebook is testing the proposition: Do people love tech companies so much they will live inside of them? When the project was announced last summer, critics dubbed it Facebookville or, in tribute to company co-founder Mark Zuckerberg, Zucktown.

The company has not warmed to these names. “I owe my soul to the company store,” Tennessee Ernie Ford sang. But Facebook’s ambitions are now confronting a more urgent problem: an escalating crisis over the company’s power to sway elections, its casual approach to data privacy and its susceptibility to Russian manipulation. If Facebook’s image is permanently sullied by the furor over Cambridge Analytica, the data firm hired by President Trump’s 2016 election campaign, Zucktown will falter before it is finished.The social media colossus is not the only Big Tech company in the complicated position of dressing up its expansion as a gift to its neighbors.A few miles down the 101 highway, another new civic-corporate partnership is underway in the city of Mountain View. Google is promising to place the public “in the very heart of Google’s vibrant community.”The search company plans a 600,000-square-foot office building with a roof that melts up into soft peaks, kind of like a meringue. It will have stores, cafes, gardens and even a space for theatrical performances, as well as a place for consumers to test-drive new Google technology.

Google will build 5,000 homes on its property under an agreement brokered with Mountain View in December. Call it Alphabet City as a nod to Alphabet, Google’s corporate parent. The company said it was still figuring out its future as a landlord, and declined further comment.Zucktown and Alphabet City, as well as similar projects being contemplated across Silicon Valley, could at a minimum have consequences for the start-up culture that transformed fruit orchards into the world’s greatest tech hub. Silicon Valley was built by engineers jumping from company to company. That drove the innovation that sped the rise of some firms and hastened the demise of others.As workers begin to literally live at the office, they will inevitably be more beholden to bosses who also collect the rent. After all, it is much harder to find a place to live in Silicon Valley than a new job. Turnover may slump, and so might the turnover in ideas.The push into the physical also has implications for the 1.2 million people in Silicon Valley who are teachers, fitness instructors, clerks, baristas — all those who hold jobs that do not come with stock options. As they inch down the clogged streets and bid money they don’t have on miserable houses, they will hear the siren call of Big Tech: We can fix broken communities by building new ones. Trust us.

“Corporations are paying for things that the city or county and state used to pay for,” said Cecilia Taylor of Belle Haven Action, a community advocacy group. “They have a lot of money. A lot of money. More than the city does. And a lot more power.”On a wall in the Facebook division charged with the company’s growth there is a poster with a classic tech admonition: “Go Big or Go Home.” Facebook is in essence tweaking that to “Go Big at Home.” About 12,000 of its 25,000 employees work in Menlo Park. In a decade, it will have space for 35,000 — slightly more than the city’s current population.The notion of communities run by and for companies has been a fixture in the United States almost from the beginning. Often these places were exercises in plunder.In the textile town of Lowell, Mass., in 1846, the mill clock slowed down to lengthen shifts and then sped up at night when the workers were off, according to one contemporary reformer. U.S. Steel built Gary, Ind., but took little responsibility for its employees, many of whom lived in substandard housing in crime-ridden neighborhoods.There were more benign examples too. Milton Hershey began building a chocolate factory in the middle of Pennsylvania in 1903 and then surrounded it with a community where, he pledged, there would be “no poverty, no nuisances, no evil.” In return for surrendering certain rights — like local elections and privacy — workers in the town of Hershey got medical coverage, a free junior college, parks and a zoo.Corporate good will, however, had a way of curdling over time.In Wisconsin, the Kohler family established a plumbing-fixtures factory in 1900 and then created a town around it. Kohler built houses for couples and dorms for single men, financed schools, had a pension plan and paid well. When economic conditions deteriorated during the Depression, however, the employees tried to strike. Kohler responded by arming its deputies with machine guns. In the ensuing clash, more than 40 strikers were shot and two were killed.By the 1960s, the era of the company town in America was fading, even as countries like China picked up the notion. Zhengzhou is a remote Chinese city that was once impoverished. It now has 350,000 workers building iPhones.        Continue reading the main story

Hardy Green, author of “The Company Town: The Industrial Edens and Satanic Mills That Shaped the American Economy,” said that the tech companies had been reviving elements of the company town in the United States for years now.

The free meals, nap pods, concierge services, yoga classes, on-site laundry and haircuts are a perk but also a modern way of slowing down the mill clock so the workers can spend more time working. But in a society where government is increasingly ineffective, company towns are nevertheless likely to be welcomed, or at least tolerated.“It may be the best option for many, just as a benevolent dictatorship can be O.K. for as long as the benevolence lasts,” Mr. Green said.No Free Wi-FiOnly seven years ago, Silicon Valley had a very different attitude about building housing for workers, much less the community. A gaunt Steve Jobs, in what would turn out to be his last public appearance, made his case before the Cupertino City Council for a new Apple headquarters.Mr. Jobs told council members how great the new doughnut-shaped headquarters was going to be. It would have a lot of trees, a theater, curved windows. Architecture students would come from all over to study it.City Council member Kris Wang had a question: How could the 60,000 Cupertino residents benefit from this new campus?“We’d like to continue to stay here and pay taxes,” Mr. Jobs said. “If we can’t, we’d have to go somewhere like Mountain View.”Ms. Wang, a former Cupertino mayor, persisted. “Do we get free Wi-Fi or something like that?”“I’m a simpleton,” Mr. Jobs replied. “I always had this view that we pay taxes and the city should do those things. That’s why we pay taxes. If we can get out of paying taxes I’d be glad to put up a Wi-Fi network.”
    Steve Jobs, in 2011, presents his plans for a new headquarters building to the Cupertino City Council.  Video by Cupertino City ChannelSince that June 2011 meeting, the number of hours commuters in Silicon Valley lose every day to congestion has doubled to 66,000. About 300,000 new jobs have been created, pushing the median apartment rental rate up 37 percent and the median cost of a home to $968,000.

Meanwhile, the big companies — not only Apple but Amazon, which has an increasingly large presence in Silicon Valley, as well as Facebook and Google — are much wealthier.Apple built a $5 billion campus that, for all its splendor, is not readily accessible by mass transit. That problem was compounded by the company’s apparent lack of interest in where its new employees would live. Decisions like these are no longer acceptable from a public relations point of view, and would not be smart for the companies in any case. If Silicon Valley continues choking on its traffic, the companies will find hiring not merely difficult but impossible. Even for a tech programmer, a $2 million house is a hurdle.So the virtual companies are being forced to grapple with the most intractable physical issues.“I don’t think Google, for instance, thought they were going to have to get into the transportation business,” said Allison Arieff, editorial director of San Francisco Bay Area Planning and Urban Research Association, a research organization. “But they now have a giant swath of the company devoted to getting people around. Housing seems the next step. No one bats an eye if universities build housing for students, grad students and tenured professors.”‘Money in Every Problem’When the tech companies played a much smaller role in Silicon Valley 25 years ago, even the working class could afford to live here. So could Stanford University students. Traffic flowed naturally.However enticing this past might seem, efforts to put the brakes on growth have had limited success.Measure M, a 2014 effort to restrict development in Menlo Park’s downtown, was soundly defeated by voters. Patti Fry, a former chairwoman of the Menlo Park City Planning Commission and an architect of the measure, said she is wary of Facebook’s increasing size and power.“They’re doing more than most companies, but most of what they do serves them,” she said. “I do not expect a company to have as a priority providing community services that a real community needs. They’re in business to be in business.”Drew Combs is a former journalist who became a member of the Menlo Park Planning Commission and then ran for City Council in 2014. He was loosely associated with Measure M and when it failed, so did his bid. He is now chairman of the planning commission, which reviews the use permits required for large projects.“I don’t think in a lot of cases this is a good-versus-evil battle,” Mr. Combs said. “This is a negotiation between different stakeholders.”        Continue reading the main story

Mr. Combs has since gotten a new job. He now works at Facebook. He recuses himself when Facebook issues come up before the commission, and also recuses himself from the question of whether Facebook is turning into a one-company town.

“Local issues here are passionately and thoroughly debated,” he said. “This hasn’t waned during the six years I’ve been involved and I don’t expect that it will in the future.”Facebook’s move toward openness and community engagement is recent. Its current campus, which it moved into in 2011, is a ring of buildings with a “street” in the middle that has restaurants, pop-up shops, a book exchange and other amenities, but only employees can go there.Across the street, the company opened in 2015 an office designed by Frank Gehry. It is basically one enormous room — the largest open-floor plan in the world, Facebook says. On the landscaped roof is a garden, a walking loop and many trees. The neighbors cannot see any of this.In Zucktown, this notion of firmly separated insiders and outsiders will be deliberately blurred.“The retail stores will not be managed by Facebook. But we have the mechanism, we are the property owner,” says Mr. Tenanes, the real estate chief, adding that he doesn’t know exactly how it will work in practice. “It is a bit new.”Menlo Science & Technology Park, a decaying office park that will be torn down for Willow Village, is not exactly a beloved part of the city, and neither are the other sites on which Facebook has been building. They were in an industrial zone. That has helped insulate the company from criticism, which nonetheless simmers beneath the surface in Belle Haven.The Peery Foundation, a grantmaker based nearby in Palo Alto, made a short video two years ago documenting how the area around Facebook’s headquarters was changing. It interviewed dozens of local residents, including one woman who referred to landlords who had been renting to low-income families and were now selling their properties. “Eventually,” she said, “there’s going to be nobody here but Facebook.”Facebook, in a comment at the end of the film, acknowledges, “We still have a lot of work to do.” The company has increased its efforts in the community. So has the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, a limited liability company set up by Mr. Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan for philanthropy. At the same time, Facebook has continued to expand.

Ms. Taylor grew up in Belle Haven, left, came back to run for the Menlo Park City Council in 2016, narrowly lost, and last year formed Belle Haven Action. It is an organization on a shoestring; she and two colleagues do not have offices and hold meetings at the local community center.

“Facebook is very smart,” she said. “They have money in every problem. Immigration. Housing. Transportation. Education.” For example, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative gave $3 million to an East Palo Alto legal services group that helps low-income residents with housing and immigration issues. It has given more than $7 million to create a primary school.And it is helping fund Belle Haven Action. In January, the organization got a $75,000 grant from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative.Ms. Taylor acknowledged it is awkward for an advocacy group to be funded by the company it is confronting, but said: “When you don’t have resources, that makes your work so much harder. This is about being a disrupter but also a negotiator.”A recent accomplishment by Belle Haven Action: getting a “no right turn” sign on a busy Facebook parking lot to stop workers from heading deeper into the community in an attempt to avoid congestion. Next it would like the company to install cameras on the streets to monitor traffic and pedestrian safety.“We need movement because nothing has been done for so long,” said Ms. Taylor. “Now Facebook comes in and they’re willing to give us a few pennies and something for the community. The trains will run. We’ll have better schools, a grocery store — although we’re going to push for a co-op.”Modeling for Other CitiesMr. Jobs promised Cupertino nothing — and that’s about all Cupertino got. Apple gave $6 million to an affordable housing fund and pays certain fees to the city, but the gleaming new campus is resolutely closed to the public.Its critics, Apple says, don’t understand.“We didn’t make Apple Park for other people,” Apple chief design officer Jonathan Ive said at a recent talk in Washington. “It wasn’t made for you.”

Ms. Wang, the former Cupertino council member, has no regrets about not pushing Mr. Jobs harder. “I’m proud of Apple,” she says. “They’ve done a good job. The campus is very impressive.”Her only wish — and it’s a small one — is that someday Apple will invite her in to actually see it.If Apple is unapproachable, Facebook and its money are becoming inescapable. In addition to the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative’s grants to local organizations, the social network is getting more involved with local policing.In 2014, Facebook paid $200,000 to create a new Menlo Park police substation adjoining its campus. It pays the annual rent. It also financed the $173,146 annual salary and benefits of an officer. Last year the company proposed giving the city $11 million to pay for a six-officer unit. That plan evoked some disquiet.“Instead of being beholden to the public, public servants will be beholden to a private company,” a local activist, J.T. Faraji, said at a City Council meeting.

“Our goal is to strengthen the community,” said Juan Salazar, a Facebook public policy manager. “We want a more permeable relationship, where we engage more. The parks, the grocery store, are places to congregate together, to build a sense of place.”David Kirkpatrick, whose book “The Facebook Effect” is a history of the company’s early years, is ambivalent about the expansion. While he says “Facebook is a company that at least tries to have a conscience,” he also worries about so much enforced togetherness on employees.“Facebook has the attitude that if you are really a good employee you will live, eat and sleep Facebook,” he said. “That creates insularity, which is a big problem in Silicon Valley already.”

If Silicon Valley is the laboratory for the increasingly intimate relationship between big tech, its workers and its neighbors (who are also frequently its users), seeds are being planted elsewhere as well.

In Toronto, an offshoot of Google won approval last fall to redevelop a 12-acre chunk of the waterfront. Chicago was so eager to land Amazon’s new headquarters that it proposed returning to the company half of all the state income tax its employees paid — money that would enrich the company, one of the world’s most highly valued, at the expense of the community. Chicago is now a finalist. So is Newark, where the state is offering up to $7 billion in tax credits.As Facebook works to make Willow Village a reality, its ambitions can only grow.The 1,500 apartments “are a starting point,” said Mr. Tenanes. “I would hope we could do more. We’re solving a problem here.”
