felt comfortable knowing that the company had access to much of his personal information  In the months before the 2016 presidential election  he watched the social network become what he called  a garbage platform of ads and weird reposted articles and people that you care about exposing themselves as racists  But Facebook was also where Mr  Perry promoted his films  where he posted ads seeking help on the set  and where he communicated with colleagues and a  massive number  of his friends and relatives Until he heard about Cambridge Analytica  I suspected this stuff was going on  but this is the first time it s been plainly exposed   he said   It seems so malicious  and Facebook seems so complicit all the way up and down  like it doesn t care about its users  Mr  Perry  39  has since

depressed about the world  but Facebook is the social media platform he is trying to abandon           Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  As a political science teacher at the University of Massachusetts Amherst  Mr  Musgrave  36  feels a professional responsibility to keep abreast of the news and academic chatter hurtling at him in the form of tweets Facebook was more valuable to him as a  low key  offstage networking tool   a  replacement for end of year family newsletters  that allowed him to  passively keep up with people   he said  He joined the platform more than a decade ago and before that had been a member of Friendster  a precursor to Facebook But in 2016  while helping his mother during her campaign for a government position in Indiana  Mr  Musgrave discovered a  poisonous swamp  of content on the site  The Cambridge Analytica findings were even more disturbing  he said  This is a company that has Orwellian levels of data about us  truly Big Brother level  but it s behaving as if it has no social responsibility and is a purely neutral medium of communication   he said   That s what s really been scary  Having deactivated his Facebook account  with plans to delete it  he now worries about connecting with people who use the social network as their main conduit of communication  I m definitely pruning myself away from some of those really important branches   he said   I watch my own students try to navigate the world of apps and smartphones  and even they don t really know how the internet works outside these enclosed garden spaces        Photo

has maintained for nearly a decade Mr  Greenzweig  40  said the Cambridge Analytica news was  the last straw   We have surpassed the tipping point  where the benefit now fails to outweigh the cost

          After this story was published  Facebook came under harsh criticism from lawmakers in the United States and Britain  Read the latest  LONDON   As the upstart voter profiling company Cambridge Analytica prepared to wade into the 2014 American midterm elections  it had a problem The firm had secured a  15 million investment from Robert Mercer  the wealthy Republican donor  and wooed his political adviser  Stephen K  Bannon  with the promise of tools that could identify the personalities of American voters and influence their behavior  But it did not have the data to make its new products work So the firm harvested private information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users without their permission  according to former Cambridge employees  associates and documents  making it one of the largest data leaks in the social network s history  The breach allowed the company to exploit the private social media activity of a huge swath of the American electorate  developing techniques that underpinned its work on President Trump s campaign in 2016           Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  An examination by The New York Times and The Observer of London reveals how Cambridge Analytica s drive to bring to market a potentially powerful new weapon put the firm   and wealthy conservative investors seeking to reshape politics   under scrutiny from investigators and lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic Photo                           Both Congress and the British Parliament have questioned Alexander Nix  chief executive of

that culture war  Details of Cambridge s acquisition and use of Facebook data have surfaced in several accounts since the business began working on the 2016 campaign  setting off a furious debate about the merits of the firm s so called psychographic modeling techniques But the full scale of the data leak involving Americans has not been previously disclosed   and Facebook  until now  has not acknowledged it  Interviews with a half dozen former employees and contractors  and a review of the firm s emails and documents  have revealed that Cambridge not only relied on the private Facebook data but still possesses most or all of the trove Cambridge paid to acquire the personal information through an outside researcher who  Facebook says  claimed to be collecting it for academic purposes During a week of inquiries from The Times  Facebook downplayed the scope of the leak and questioned whether any of the data still remained out of its control  But on Friday  the company posted a statement expressing alarm and promising to take action  This was a scam   and a fraud   Paul Grewal  a vice president and deputy general counsel at the social network  said in a statement to The Times earlier on Friday  He added that the company was suspending Cambridge Analytica  Mr  Wylie and the researcher  Aleksandr Kogan  a Russian American academic  from Facebook   We will take whatever steps are required to see that the data in question is deleted once and for all   and take action against all offending parties   Mr  Grewal said           Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Alexander Nix  the chief executive of Cambridge Analytica  and other officials had repeatedly denied obtaining or using Facebook data  most recently during a parliamentary hearing last month  But in a statement to The Times  the company acknowledged that it had acquired the data  though it blamed Mr  Kogan for violating Facebook s rules and said it had deleted the information as soon as it learned of the problem two years ago In Britain  Cambridge Analytica is facing intertwined investigations by Parliament and government regulators into allegations that it performed illegal work on the

Trump campaign  And the Justice Department s special counsel  Robert S  Mueller III  has  demanded the emails of Cambridge Analytica employees who worked for the Trump team as part of his investigation into Russian interference in the election While the substance of Mr  Mueller s interest is a closely guarded secret  documents viewed by The Times indicate that the firm s British affiliate claims to have worked in Russia and Ukraine  And the WikiLeaks founder  Julian Assange  disclosed in October that Mr  Nix had reached out to him during the campaign in hopes of obtaining private emails belonging to Mr  Trump s Democratic opponent  Hillary Clinton The documents also raise new questions about Facebook  which is already grappling with intense criticism over the spread of Russian propaganda and fake news  The data Cambridge collected from profiles  a portion of which was viewed by The Times  included details on users  identities  friend networks and  likes   Only a tiny fraction of the users had agreed to release their information to a third party  Protecting people s information is at the heart of everything we do   Mr  Grewal said   No systems were infiltrated  and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked  Still  he added   it s a serious abuse of our rules  Reading Voters  MindsThe Bordeaux flowed freely as Mr  Nix and several

Mr  Nix  a brash salesman  led the small elections division at SCL Group  a political and defense contractor  He had spent much of the year trying to break into the lucrative new world of political data  recruiting Mr  Wylie  then a 24 year old political operative with ties to veterans of President Obama s campaigns  Mr  Wylie was interested in using inherent psychological traits to affect voters  behavior and had assembled a team of psychologists and data scientists  some of them affiliated with Cambridge University The group experimented abroad  including in the Caribbean and Africa  where privacy rules were lax or nonexistent and politicians employing SCL were happy to provide government held data  former employees said Then a chance meeting brought Mr  Nix into contact with Mr  Bannon  the Breitbart News firebrand who would later become a Trump campaign and White House adviser  and with Mr  Mercer  one of the richest men on earth                         has top ad  story

with the firm  Mr  Wylie found someone who would  Dr  Kogan  who was then a psychology professor at the university and knew of the techniques  Dr  Kogan built his own app and in June 2014 began harvesting data for Cambridge Analytica  The business covered the costs   more than  800 000   and allowed him to keep a copy for his own research  according to company emails and financial records All he divulged to Facebook  and to users in fine print  was that he was collecting information for academic purposes  the social network said  It did not verify his claim  Dr  Kogan declined to provide details of what happened  citing nondisclosure agreements with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica  though he maintained that his program was  a very standard vanilla Facebook app  He ultimately provided over 50 million raw profiles to the firm  Mr  Wylie said  a number confirmed by a company email and a former colleague  Of those  roughly 30 million   a number previously reported by The Intercept   contained enough information  including places of residence  that the company could match users to other records and build psychographic profiles  Only about 270 000 users   those who participated in the survey   had consented to having their data harvested Photo                           An email from Dr  Kogan to Mr  Wylie describing traits that could be predicted

     Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  An International EffortJust as Dr  Kogan s efforts were getting underway  Mr  Mercer agreed to invest  15 million in a joint venture with SCL s elections division  The partners devised a convoluted corporate structure  forming a new American company  owned almost entirely by Mr  Mercer  with a license to the psychographics platform developed by Mr  Wylie s team  according to company documents  Mr  Bannon  who became a board member and investor  chose the name  Cambridge Analytica The firm was effectively a shell  According to the documents and former employees  any contracts won by Cambridge  originally incorporated in Delaware  would be serviced by London based SCL and overseen by Mr  Nix  a British citizen who held dual appointments at Cambridge Analytica and SCL  Most SCL employees and contractors were Canadian  like Mr  Wylie  or European But in July 2014  an American election lawyer advising the company  Laurence Levy  warned that the arrangement could violate laws limiting the involvement of foreign nationals in American elections In a memo to Mr  Bannon  Ms  Mercer and Mr  Nix  the lawyer  then at the firm Bracewell   Giuliani  warned that Mr  Nix would have to recuse himself  from substantive management  of any clients involved in United States elections  The data firm would also have to find American citizens or green card holders  Mr  Levy wrote   to manage the work and decision making functions  relative to campaign messaging and expenditures  In summer and fall 2014  Cambridge Analytica dived into the American midterm elections  mobilizing SCL contractors and employees around the country  Few Americans were involved in the work  which included polling  focus groups and message development for the John Bolton Super PAC  conservative groups in Colorado and the campaign of Senator Thom Tillis  the North Carolina Republican Cambridge Analytica  in its statement to The Times  said that all  personnel in strategic roles were U S  nationals or green card holders   Mr  Nix  never had any strategic or operational role  in an American election campaign  the company said Whether the company s American ventures violated election laws would depend on foreign employees  roles in each campaign  and on whether their work counted as strategic advice under Federal Election Commission rules Cambridge Analytica appears to have exhibited a similar pattern in the 2016 election cycle  when the company worked for the campaigns of Mr  Cruz and then Mr  Trump  While Cambridge hired more Americans to work on the races that year  most of its data scientists were citizens of the United Kingdom or other European countries  according to two former employees           Advertisement

has said that the firm s profiles helped shape Mr  Trump s strategy   statements disputed by other campaign officials   but also that Cambridge did not have enough time to comprehensively model Trump voters In a BBC interview last December  Mr  Nix said that the Trump efforts drew on  legacy psychographics  built for the Cruz campaign After the LeakBy early 2015  Mr  Wylie and more than half his original team of about a dozen people had left the company  Most were liberal leaning  and had grown disenchanted with working on behalf of the hard right candidates the Mercer family favored Cambridge Analytica  in its statement  said that Mr  Wylie had left to start a rival firm  and that it later took legal action against him to enforce intellectual property claims  It characterized Mr  Wylie and other former  contractors  as engaging in  what is clearly a malicious attempt to hurt the company  Near the end of that year  a report in The Guardian revealed that Cambridge Analytica was using private Facebook data on the Cruz campaign  sending Facebook scrambling  In a statement at the time  Facebook promised that it was  carefully investigating this situation  and would require any company misusing its data to destroy it Facebook verified the leak and   without publicly acknowledging it   sought to secure the information  efforts that continued as recently as August 2016  That month  lawyers for the social network reached out to Cambridge Analytica contractors   This data was obtained and used without permission   said a letter that was obtained by the Times   It cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately  Mr  Grewal  the Facebook deputy general counsel  said in a statement that both Dr  Kogan and  SCL Group and Cambridge Analytica

YORK    Facebook is facing the most serious crisis in its 14 year history as it deals with fallout from a major leak of user data to political consultants associated with the 2016 Trump campaign Here s a look at the scandal and what it means WHAT S GOING ON The U K  based data mining firm Cambridge Analytica has been accused of lifting the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users without their permission in order to manipulate elections  A former employee of the firm  Christopher Wylie  played a role in that action  and later told his story to journalists The crisis has renewed questions about Facebook s ability to protect the privacy of its users while also exploiting their personal details to fuel its lucrative advertising business  It has also deepened concerns about the social media network s ability to avoid being exploited to spread propaganda and sway elections Authorities in both the U S  and the U K  are investigating both Facebook and Cambridge Analytica  Facebook shares have fallen and some users are contemplating deleting their accounts           Advertisement  Continue reading the main story     WHAT DID CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA DO Wylie says the firm sought Facebook information in order to build psychological profiles on a large portion of the U S  electorate  He said the company was able to amass the database quickly with the help of an academic  Aleksander Kogan  who developed a Facebook app called  This is Your Digital Life  that appeared to be a personality test         Continue reading the main story                                Advertisement  Continue reading the main story                      That app vacuumed up information from users who gave the app permission to access their accounts   as well as additional data from their Facebook friends Kogan paid about 200 000 people to take part  tens of millions of their friends were also caught in the data dragnet    HOW HAS CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA RESPONDED Cambridge Analytica has denied wrongdoing  and the firm said it deleted any data it received from Kogan and denied using any Facebook data in its political work  Facebook  however  said it recently learned from journalists that Cambridge Analytica may have kept some of the data  spurring an investigation Kogan said he has been scapegoated by both Cambridge and Facebook  He says the data firm approached him for the project and assured him that everything he did was legal    WHAT S THE CONNECTION TO THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN Federal election records show that the Trump campaign paid Cambridge Analytica roughly

enormous sway over daily life and its massive data trove A sell off in Facebook shares reflects fear that the social network may face new regulations that could hurt profits   or that advertisers and

seeking answers  although Democrats and Republicans have disagreed on what steps to take  Privacy advocates have asked the Federal Trade Commission to investigate as well The hashtag  deletefacebook has been trending  Brian Acton  the co founder of WhatsApp  which was acquired by Facebook four years ago for  19 billion  has joined the cause  But there are no signs  so far  that users   or advertisers   are abandoning Facebook in droves    HOW IS FACEBOOK ADDRESSING THE CRISIS After five days of silence  Zuckerberg released a Facebook post admitting mistakes and outlining steps to

apps had to user data in 2014  That came too late to stop Cambridge  The company said nothing about overhauling its data collection policies or taking steps to prevent the unauthorized political use of Facebook data Facebook suspended Cambridge over allegations that it kept the improperly obtained user data  It has also suspended the access of Kogan and Wylie  as well as Cambridge s parent

under the pseudonym Elliot Alderson  caused a flurry on Saturday with a series of tweets saying the Modi app was sending personal user data to a third party domain that was traced to an American company  Hi  My name is Narendra Modi  I am India s Prime Minister  When you sign up for my official App  I give all your data to my friends in American companies   wrote opposition Congress Party Chief Rahul Gandhi in a Twitter message on Sunday The BJP responded on Twitter  saying Gandhi was trying to divert attention  The BJP has accused the Congress of engaging Cambridge Analytica in India  a charge the opposition party has denied Alderson  who initially pointed out that the Modi app was sharing data with a third party without the consent of users  earlier on Sunday posted a new tweet saying the app had  quietly  updated its privacy policy after his previous tweets Reuters could not independently verify Alderson s claims Modi has not commented on the issue  Reporting by Devidutta

                        DUBLIN   As Ireland prepares to vote in May on a referendum on whether to repeal its ban on abortion  anti abortion campaigners can be seen rallying most weekdays on the streets of Dublin  outside Parliament  and at universities  news media buildings and the offices of human rights groups They arrive wearing body cameras and bearing placards with graphic images of aborted fetuses But not all of them are Irish Of the eight members of the anti abortion Irish Center for Bio Ethical Reform who protested outside the offices of The Irish Times on a recent weekday  only three   including the group s leader  Jean Engela   are Irish  The others include Americans and a Hungarian  We try to be as multinational as the abortion industry  and they make no apologies for sending in their international affiliates to pontificate to the Irish people   said Dr  Engela           Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  The protests   relatively small but highly visible here in the Irish capital   are an emblem of the strong emotions as the country prepares to vote in late May on whether to retain the Eighth Amendment of the Irish Constitution  which bans abortion in nearly all circumstances and was itself enacted by a referendum  in 1983   Abortion was illegal before 1983  but the amendment made it even harder to terminate a pregnancy  even to save to mother s life          Continue reading the main story                                Advertisement  Continue reading the main story                      To the age old debates around abortion   including questions of when life begins and of women s control over their reproductive rights   the referendum has added a new dimension of concern about potential outside interference in the vote An ethics regulator recently ordered two abortion rights groups  Amnesty International Ireland and the Abortion Rights Campaign  to return grants of  150 000 and  25 000 to George Soros s Open Society Foundations  It said the money was a foreign political donation intended to affect the outcome of a referendum or election  and therefore banned But so far it does not appear that any anti abortion groups have been asked to return overseas donations  despite reports that money is being openly raised on their behalf  particularly in the United States One American group  the Pro Life Action League  told an Irish newspaper in 2012 that anti abortion groups were raising hundreds of thousands of dollars to support Irish anti abortion groups like Youth Defence  which has been linked to far right movements in Europe Youth Defence did not respond to a request for comment  The Pro Life Action League s executive director  Eric J  Scheidler  said that the remarks concerned American support for the Irish anti abortion movement over several decades  and said his group had not raised money for the current campaign The Irish Center for Bio Ethical Reform  which picketed The Irish Times  receives foreign funding but claims to be exempt from government oversight   We are an educational body   Dr  Engela said He denied that the protest had anything to do with the coming vote  and asserted that some of the volunteers were full time activists with their own sources of funding           Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Some commentators argue that anti abortion groups are not being held to the same stringent standard as abortion rights groups Theresa Reidy  a political scientist at University College Cork  said that there was a long history of overseas interests taking sides in Irish referendums  particularly on issues like the European Union  Over the last decade  even as support for the abortion ban has waned  concerns about possible outside interference have risen  she said Photo                           Jean Engela of the Irish Center for Bio Ethical Reform preparing posters                                       Credit             Paulo Nunes dos Santos for The New York Times                     Siobhan Mullally  of the Irish Center for Human Rights at the National University of Ireland  Galway  said the problem of undeclared foreign funding went beyond the abortion debate  and was  also a question about how charities are funded in general  The Roman Catholic Church  long a major power in Ireland  was the main driver in the 1983 referendum  The church also opposed  successfully  a referendum in 1986 that would have legalized divorce  In the decades since  however  its social and moral authority has been gravely weakened by a number of scandals  most notably clerical child sex abuse The church could not prevent the legalization of contraception and was on the losing side in referendums that legalized divorce in 1995 and same sex marriage in 2015      Newsletter Sign Up     Continue reading the main story            headline   The Interpreter Newsletter   summary   Understand the world with sharp insight and commentary on the

they are turning to arguments that abortion harms women s health  They are also turning to social media tools After recent revelations about the misuse of Facebook data to sway Britain s referendum on European Union membership in 2016  and the United States presidential election later that year  fears are growing similar tactics might be used in the referendum campaign The Save the 8th Campaign  an anti abortion group  has hired Kanto Systems  a London based political consultancy  to help run its campaign Kanto Systems s founder  Thomas Borwick  was chief technology officer for the Vote Leave campaign in Britain  and developed a canvassing app for Cambridge Analytica  the data mining organization that exploited Facebook data on behalf of the 2016 Trump campaign           Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Mr  Borwick said that he himself had not worked for the Trump campaign  and referred a reporter to a statement from Save the 8th  which said that Kanto would be performing  some data analytics for us  but would not be engaged in  any voter profiling or voter targeting  John McGuirk  a spokesman for Save the 8th  said that in the Irish electoral system  which does not have online voter rolls  individually targeted advertising of the sort practiced by Cambridge Analytica would not be possible   In terms of targeting advertising at individual voters  we couldn t do that even if we wanted to  which we don t   he said The Times of London reported that the Pro Life Campaign  Ireland s largest umbrella anti abortion group  has retained uCampaign  a Washington firm that has developed apps for the Trump campaign  the National Rifle Association  the Republican National Committee and Vote Leave   Neither uCampaign nor the Pro Life Campaign responded to requests for comment  The Transparent Referendum Initiative  a small group of Irish technology advocates  said it had already detected paid social media campaigns stealthily targeting Irish voters  This month  the group introduced a crowdsourced monitoring tool to detect and investigate anonymous or vaguely sourced paid advertising on Facebook  It has already identified 92 such ads relating to the Irish referendum  55 with anti abortion messages and 37 in support of abortion rights Political advertising is banned on Irish television and radio  but the online world is a different matter  There is no law against someone anywhere else in the world signing a commercial contract with a British company to use foreign money or unknown money  that is not going through any official regulated campaign  in order to influence an Irish vote   said Liz Carolan of the Transparent Referendum Initiative   There s a serious vulnerability in our democratic system  And it s now being exploited by incredibly sophisticated campaign techniques  and Facebook doesn t have to tell us who s doing it  Responding to the Cambridge Analytica revelations  the Irish government announced last week that it planned to give Irish regulators new powers to curb external influence on Irish voters A spokeswoman for Facebook s Dublin office said that the company agreed with the need for more transparency in advertising  and that it was developing a new tool to help people identify paid ads in their timelines and to identify and label political content  However  she said  the tools will not be ready in time for the May referendum                                            A version of this article appears in print on March 27  2018  on Page A4 of the New York edition with the headline  Fear of

here Are we witnessing the end of a mania Investors  always willing to believe in technology companies  spent the last three years piling into the shares of companies like Facebook  Amazon and Netflix with special abandon  Now the intellectual underpinnings of the tech rally are being seriously tested           Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Stocks in the best known tech companies have plunged in recent days  The NYSE FANG  index  which tracks the share price of 10 companies  including Facebook  Apple and Amazon  has fallen nearly 14 percent from its recent high  Given that the index has soared 50 percent in just the past 12 months  the recent decline could just be the sort of sell off that punctuates any long term rally         Continue reading the main story

industries  And as we ve seen after previous fervors  investors can take a long time to regain their faith Facebook is down 20 percent from its recent high  Most of the slide came after news reports showing how the company s data was misused  Investors have to grapple with the possibility that Facebook won t be sharing as much data as it does  undermining its ability to generate ever increasing amounts of advertising revenue Nvidia  a computer chip maker intent on being a leader in automated driving technology  is off 12 percent from its recent high  The company said on Tuesday that it would halt tests of its autonomous driving technology on public roads after an Uber self driving car hit and killed a pedestrian in Arizona Tesla is not a tech stock  but it is included in the FANG  index  and its supporters believe deeply in its power to revolutionize the auto industry  Growing fears about Tesla s ability to finance its expansion have helped drag its stock down 33 percent from its recent high  Ominously  the price of Tesla s bonds is also falling  signaling that the company is losing the confidence of creditors Of course  on their march higher  tech stocks overcame obstacles  like management problems at Uber and the poor performance of Snap s initial public offering But the latest problems have raised deeper  broader doubts  and that may keep the uncertainty around longer  Investors have viewed automated driving technology as a huge potential source of growth for some companies  But after the Uber incident in Arizona  those companies may take a more realistic look at what they have to spend to create a technology that is efficient and safe  and conclude that they have to pull out of the race or pare back  Users of social media and regulators may prevent social media companies from sharing so much of their data with advertisers  and that could restrain revenue growth And if the passion for two or three big tech companies wanes  the cooling may spread   Peter

Jonathan Swan of Axios  citing anonymous sources  reported  Trump has talked about changing Amazon s tax treatment because he s worried about mom and pop retailers being put out of business  Mr  Swan added  Trump s wealthy friends tell him Amazon is destroying their businesses  His real estate buddies tell him   and he agrees   that Amazon is killing shopping malls and brick and mortar retailers  Shares of Amazon have tumbled more than 7 percent at one point Wednesday  but they pared those losses after a White House official told Reuters there were no specific policy changes related to Amazon being considered at the moment  But the official added that the administration is always looking at different options on a range of policy issues How concerned should investors be GBH Insights analyst Daniel Ives writes  While it s now a hand holding time for Amazon given this new regulatory potential threat  we believe the reality of these worries altering the company s business model and future

after plunging 8 percent on Tuesday Tuesday s slide was driven  in part  by the National Transportation Safety Board s announcement that it was investigating a fatal crash last week involving a Tesla vehicle in California  News that Jaguar Land Rover was teaming up with Alphabet Inc  s Waymo unit probably didn t help either But the continued decline in Tesla s stock   its shares are down more than 20 percent since mid March   speaks to the bigger concern surrounding Tesla  How it funds itself Investors have grown increasingly worried as Tesla burns through cash and struggles to meet its own production goals for the Model 3  Late Tuesday  Moody s downgraded Tesla s credit rating further into junk territory and said its outlook on the company is negative  The credit ratings agency cited production delays and said Tesla may soon need to raise more than  2 billion Those concerns can be seen not just in Tesla s stock price but also in the trading of its debt  The FT points out that  Tesla s eight year bond maturing in 2025 traded on Wednesday at 87 6 cents to the dollar  the lowest since issuance  The yield has surged to 7 5 percent from 6 59 percent on Monday  Liam Denning of Bloomberg Gadfly writes  Challenges on the factory floor and the balance sheet are converging  Drawing inexorably closer to a refinancing wall  Tesla needs a real shot of confidence  and capital  to keep its money machine turning over this year   Given Tuesday s bond blowout  that almost certainly means tapping the equity market again  Nothing like being a motivated seller to put a floor under a

OF FACEBOOKThe Facebook leak shows that the data should never have been collected  Cliqz s Al Hames said  We should all be outraged but nobody should be surprised  Everybody who has data will eventually lose that data  Cliqz has an icon that shows how many private data points trackers are trying to access when you visit a site Its anti tracking feature substitutes private data with random

price is now back at the level at which the bank sold those shares  Shareholders must be livid  Not only that  Deutsche Bank s stock market value is less than 40 percent of its net worth as stated on its balance sheet  its stock price is  11 30 and its book value per share is  30 16   When a company trades at a hefty discount to its net worth  it either needs to raise a lot of new capital  which doesn t seem to be the case at Deutsche Bank  or investors have serious doubts about the company s business model  So  I ll rejig the bank s business model   you say to yourself   that s what new C E O  s do  You look for ways and stumble upon an unavoidable obstacle  Deutsche Bank is heavily dependent on Wall Street revenue  which can be far more unpredictable than revenue from other businesses  Last year  revenue from Deutsche Bank s corporate and investment bank  which has struggled to keep up with its peers  accounted for 54 percent of the bank s overall revenue  Compare that with JPMorgan Chase  whose investment bank accounted for a third of its revenue last year  And you are stuck with the Wall Street operations  no one wants to buy an investment bank with  1 2 trillion in assets Maybe you can cut costs  another go to tactic of an incoming C E O  Indeed  Deutsche Bank s investment bank employees seem better paid than their counterparts at other firms  Going by a back of the envelope calculation  the unit s compensation expense is equivalent to 44 percent of its revenue  excluding the interest the investment bank earns on its assets   That s higher than the 39 percent ratio for JPMorgan s investment bank last year  and 41 percent for Goldman Sachs  Maybe you could slash the pay of bankers and traders Sorry  Mr  Cryan tried that   Peter Eavis

who should become the next head of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York  a powerful regulator on Wall Street s front lines Contenders for the post should address one question  What will you do to clean up the culture at banks William C  Dudley  the outgoing president of the New York Fed  had made improving the culture at the firms he oversaw a key initiative of his tenure of at the institution           Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  When Mr  Dudley took the helm in 2009  the financial crisis had left the New York Fed s reputation as a regulator damaged  The institution had not done enough to address the severe weaknesses at the banks it oversaw  like Citigroup  Early on  Mr  Dudley commissioned a review of the New York Fed s bank supervision department and then overhauled it  But in 2012  JPMorgan Chase  also overseen by the New York Fed  suffered huge trading losses in what was known as the London Whale scandal  The New York Fed was faulted Following the embarrassing London Whale imbroglio  Mr  Dudley used his bully pulpit to focus on bankers  ethics  Banks were stronger financially  but recent scandals showed that the culture of their firms still needed to improve  he observed  And if a cleanup didn t occur  it may be a sign that they needed to be reduced in size  Mr  Dudley said in a 2014 speech that rattled Wall Street The next big banking scandal   Wells Fargo s widespread mistreatment of customers  which came to light in 2016   strongly supported Mr  Dudley s arguments  Wells Fargo was considered one of the most stable  too big to fail  banks  with its focus on plain vanilla lending  but in fact  its retail sales culture had degraded  The Fed earlier this year slapped relatively harsh sanctions on the bank  including a limit on its size The example of Wells Fargo is pertinent for John C  Williams  a top candidate to replace Mr  Dudley  Mr  Williams is head of the San Francisco Fed  which oversees Wells Fargo And there is still work to do to fulfill Mr  Dudley s initiative  He proposed a  database of banker misconduct   similar to the one for brokers  that would track a banker s record on ethics and compliance  Banks could consult it before hiring  But this idea has not taken off  In a speech at the U S  Chamber of Commerce on Monday  Mr  Dudley explained why   Understandably  firms are concerned about legal risk if they share information about banker misconduct  but there may be ways to address these concerns through legislation  Mr  Dudley had also pressed banks  boards of directors to focus on ethical culture  On Monday  he said the boards had set up separate committees to focus on culture and conduct   We ve made part of the journey but I think more could be done   Mr  Dudley said  Whether it will  depends on who steps into his shoes   Peter EavisHow worrying is the flattening yield curve The yield curve is near its flattest level since the financial crisis  The difference between the yields on the two year and 10 year Treasury notes is at 0 52 percentage points  not far off its post crisis low of 0 50 percentage points hit in January That has some asking if the nine year old economic recovery is at risk Since the end of World War II  no barometer has done a better job of predicting a recession than the yield curve  A flattening yield curve tends to indicate slowing economic growth in the near future  But what is more worrisome is if the yield curve goes beyond flattening and into outright inversion           Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  The chances of a recession when the yield curve is flattening is just 20 percent  according to the calculations of Jim Paulsen  the chief investment strategist at the Leuthold Group  That jumps to 72 percent when the curve inverts  Unless the yield curve actually inverts  however  the probability of recession remains quite low  While a flatter curve may have implications for the pace of future economic growth  it does not materially raise recession risk  There is another reason not to be too concerned about a flattening yield curve  and it has to do with the actions of central banks around the world  The unprecedented stimulus from the Fed  Bank of Japan and E C B  have brought down long term rates  That means the yield curve might not be the predictor it once was                     nyttech stock

Facebook for exposing users  informationFacebook agrees to settle charges by the F T C  that it deceived users by telling them that they could keep their profile information private and then

     NEW YORK    Facebook is giving its privacy tools a makeover as it reels from criticisms over its data practices and faces tighter European regulations in the coming months The changes won t affect Facebook s privacy policies or the types of data it gathers on users  But the company hopes its 2 2 billion users will have an easier time navigating its complex and often confusing privacy and security settings  Facebook says it also wants to give users a simpler way to access and download the data it collects on them Wednesday s announcement follows revelations that a Trump affiliated consulting firm  Cambridge Analytica  got data on millions of Facebook users  That included information on friends of people who had downloaded a psychological quiz app  even though those friends hadn t given explicit consent to sharing  In addition  Facebook is also facing widespread criticism for collecting years of contact names  telephone numbers and call and text histories from Android users  The company has not said exactly what it used such data for or why it needed it  On Monday  the Federal Trade Commission said it is investigating Facebook over its privacy practices Facebook s chief privacy officer  Erin Egan  said in a blog post that most of the privacy updates have been in the works for  some time  but the events of the past several days underscore their importance

controls remain hard to find and use for many people  For example  Facebook announced in 2009 that it was consolidating six privacy pages and more than 30 settings on to a single privacy page Yet mobile users still had to go to nearly 20 different places to access all of their privacy controls  Now  Facebook says they will be accessible from a single place  Facebook says it is also adding

company is taking to address privacy concerns Facebook has been working on the changes in preparation for the European Union s General Data Protection Regulation  which were approved two years ago and take effect May 25  The rules are designed to make it easier for consumers to give and withdraw consent for the use of their data  They apply to any company that collects data on EU residents  no matter where it is based To comply with this  Facebook is adding a section called  access your information   a secure way for users to manage data they ve shared with the company  including status updates  comments and things they have searched for  That s where people can go to delete information or download a copy  While this download was already possible  it took some time to figure out how to do it  Cox said the changes let people browse through their information in detail  without having to download it  For example  users will now be able to look up a post from a specific date in the past Cox said that while the changes are  in line with the principle of GDPR   there s also a  bunch of stuff that goes above and beyond that  Facebook also said it will propose updates to its terms

YORK    To get an idea of the data Facebook collects about you  just ask for it  You ll get a file with every photo and comment you ve posted  all the ads you ve clicked on  stuff you ve liked and searched for and everyone you ve friended   and unfriended   over the years Now  the company is under fire for collecting data on people s phone calls and text messages if they used Android devices  While Facebook insists users had to specifically agree  or opt in  to have such data collected  at least some users appeared surprised Facebook s trove of data is used to decide which ads to show you  It also makes using Facebook more seamless and enjoyable   say  by determining which posts to emphasize in your feed  or reminding you of friends  birthdays Facebook claims to protect all this information  and it lays out its terms in a privacy policy that s relatively clear and concise  But few users bother to read it  You might be surprised at what Facebook s privacy policy allows   and what s left unsaid           Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Facebook s privacy practices have come under fire after a Trump affiliated political consulting firm  Cambridge Analytica

reading the main story                      Facebook defends its data collection and sharing activities by noting that it s adhering to a privacy policy it shares with users  Thanks largely to years of privacy scandals and pressure from users and regulators  Facebook also offers a complex set of controls that let users limit how their information is used   to a point You can turn off ad targeting and see generic ads instead  the way you would on television or in a newspaper  In the ad settings  you d need to uncheck all your interests  interactions with companies and websites and other personal information you don t want to use in targeting  Of course  if you click on a new interest after this  you ll have to go back and uncheck it in your ad preferences to prevent targeting  It s a tedious task As Facebook explains  it puts you in target categories based on your activity  So  if you are 35  live in Seattle and have liked an outdoor adventure page  Facebook may show you an ad for a mountain bike shop in your area But activity isn t limited to pages or posts you like  comments you make and your use of outside apps and websites      Newsletter Sign Up     Continue reading the

you start typing something and change your mind and delete it  Facebook keeps those and analyzes them too   Zeynep Tufekci  a prominent techno sociologist  said in a 2017 TED talk And  increasingly  Facebook tries to match what it knows about you with your offline data  purchased from data brokers or gathered in other ways  The more information it has  the fuller the picture of you it can offer to advertisers  It can infer things about you that you had no intention of sharing   anything from your ethnicity to personality traits  happiness and use of addictive substances  Tufekci said These types of data collection aren t necessarily explicit in privacy policies or settings What Facebook does say is that advertisers don t get the raw data  They just tell Facebook what kind of people they want their ads to reach  then Facebook makes the matches and shows the ads Apps can also collect a lot of data about you  as revealed in the Cambridge Analytica scandal  The firm got the data from a researcher who paid 270 000 Facebook users to complete a psychological profile quiz back in 2014  But the quiz gathered information on their friends as well  bringing the total number of people affected to about 50 million           Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Facebook says Cambridge Analytica got the data inappropriately   but only because the app said it collected data for research rather than political profiling  Gathering data on friends was permitted at the time  even if they had never installed the app or given explicit consent Ian Bogost  a Georgia Tech communications professor who built a tongue in cheek game called  Cow Clicker  in 2010  wrote in The Atlantic recently that abusing the Facebook platform for  deliberately nefarious ends  was easy to do then  What s worse  he said  it was hard to avoid extracting private data If  you played Cow Clicker  even just once  I got enough of your personal data that  for years  I could have assembled a reasonably sophisticated profile of your interests and behavior   he wrote   I might still be able to  all the data is still there  stored on my private server  where Cow Clicker is still running  allowing players to keep clicking where a cow once stood  Facebook has since restricted the amount of types of data apps can access  But other types of data collection are still permitted  For this reason  it s a good idea to check all the apps you ve given permissions to over the years  You can also do this in your settings         Continue reading the main story

perspectives and experiences and offering insight into how we work Last weekend  Alyssa Severson  a member of our Reader Center Facebook Group  posed a question to her fellow group members   Are you emotionally affected by the news  Sometimes reading about politics  human rights infringements  war zones  etc  can make me feel anxious or hopeless in a big way  What are some coping strategies you employ  Coincidentally  a story published the same day profiled an Ohio man who has unplugged from news media entirely and describes himself as  bored  yet happy  But our roundup of reactions to the story suggested many readers don t consider such a drastic solution acceptable What s the alternative  Reader Center Facebook Group members shared a mélange of ideas for keeping news generated stress at bay  After you read them  tell us some of the ways you tackle this kind of anxiety           Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Comments below have been condensed and edited for clarity Alyssa Severson  Thailand   Sometimes I ll put a moratorium on a certain subject if it s bringing up really negative feelings   Right now  no Myanmar ethnic cleansing articles   Sometimes realizing how many things are wrong with the world gives me a serious existential crisis  but I think that s just part of life when you care about others         Continue reading the main story

running for office Stacie Birchett  Richmond  Va    Outlander reruns Marjie Gowdy  Callaway  Va    I ve watched La La Land more times than I can count Jeffrey Itell  Vietnam   I read the news in the context that good  news  is happening always  I read The Times to find out when Mount Agung is spewing lava     and not for the magnificent view it provides from Gili Trawangan  The Times reports the news  which includes important events I want to know about  But it doesn t provide me a complete snapshot of the world Shasta Gaughen  Escondido  Ca    When it gets to be too much  I ll delete my sources without reading and take a timeout  Cats help  And ice cream  Lots of ice cream  Here s one of my cats encouraging me to take a break Photo                                        Credit             Shasta Gaughen                     Elaine Tanzman  Sometimes reading disturbing news will inspire me to contribute to organizations that I have forgotten about  For example  after reading about the Neo Nazi riots in Charlottesville  I donated to the Southern Poverty Law Center Daniel Mainz  Brooklyn  NY   I ve appreciated a couple of news sources that combine research and commentary with practical  actionable steps readers can take to make their voices heard  They are DCReport org from Pulitzer winner David Cay Johnston and Lauren Duca s columns in Teen Vogue  Yes  I admit it  Teen Vogue  I read it for the politics Deb Amlen  New York Times crossword columnist   I do regular news fasts and have tried not to wallow on places like Twitter  Also  did you know that the crossword puzzle was originally run in newspapers as an escape from the news pages during World War II  It still allows readers to keep their brains sharp and talk about something other than world events

Reader s Digest since I was a kid  It might be perceived as cheesy  but the  positive news  in it is a good reminder that the frequency of what s covered by media does not reflect the reality of how the world is Deborah Suraya  New York City   Having dinner together with friends really helps because there is usually a lot of laughter  chatter  etc  I also follow comedians on Twitter Instagram  not just pure news outlets   Julia Lansford  from Russia  living in NYC   World can seem a horrible place at a glance  However  NYT has a great project  The Week in Good News  When down from all the negativity  I also remember that dialogue between Frodo and Sam Gamgee in Peter Jackson s  The Lord of the Rings  FRODO  What are we holding on to  Sam SAM  That there s some good in this world  Mr  Frodo  And it s worth fighting for Alexandra Velasco  Queens  NY   I m a democrat and  at the time  I couldn t understand why anyone would vote for Trump  But since he got elected  I ve been

yourself  Maybe it s the way you feel while scrolling through your Twitter feed   anxious  twitchy  a little world weary   or your unease when you see a child watching YouTube videos  knowing she s just a few algorithmic nudges away from a rabbit hole filled with lunatic conspiracies and gore  Or maybe it was this month s Facebook privacy scandal  which reminded you that you ve entrusted the most intimate parts of your digital life to a profit maximizing surveillance machine Our growing discomfort with our largest social platforms is reflected in polls  One recently conducted by Axios and SurveyMonkey found that all three of the major social media companies   Facebook  Twitter and Google  which shares a parent company with YouTube   are significantly less popular with Americans than they were five months ago   And Americans might be the lucky ones  Outside the United States  social media is fueling real world violence and empowering autocrats  often with much less oversight  But it would be a mistake to throw up our hands and assume that it has to be this way  The original dream of social media   producing healthy discussions  unlocking new forms of creativity  connecting people to others with similar interests   shouldn t be discarded because of the failures of the current market leaders  And lots of important things still happen on even the most flawed networks  The West Virginia teachers  strike and last weekend s March for Our Lives  for example  were largely organized on Facebook and Twitter The primary problem with today s social networks is that they re already too big  and are trapped inside a market based system that forces them to keep growing  Facebook can t stop monetizing our personal data for the same reason that Starbucks can t stop selling coffee   it s the heart of the enterprise           Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Many of the fixes being proposed involve regulation  The Honest Ads Act  a bill in the Senate  would require greater transparency for online political ads  The European Union s General Data Protection Regulation  which goes into effect in May  aims to give users greater control of their digital information trails         Continue reading the main story                                Advertisement  Continue reading the main story                      But these efforts don t touch the underlying problems  and in fact could make it harder for start ups to compete with the giants If we re really serious about changing how social networks operate  far more radical interventions are required  Here are three possible ways to rescue social media from the market based pressures that got us here Give Power to the PeopleIn their book  New Power   which comes out next week  Jeremy Heimans and Henry Timms write about the struggle between centralized  top down institutions  which represent  old power   and decentralized  bottom up movements  which represent  new power  Facebook  they write  is an example of a new power institution that serves old power interests  It harvests the creative output of billions of people and turns it into a giant  centralized enterprise  with most users sharing none of the economic value they create and getting no say in the platform s governance Instead  the authors ask  what if a social network was truly run by its users  If you re contributing economic value to something of this much social consequence  you should share in the value you re creating   Mr  Heimans told me Nathan Schneider  a professor of media studies at the University of Colorado  had a similar idea in 2016  when he proposed that Twitter users band together to buy the platform from its shareholders and convert it into a user run collective  similar to the way a local credit union is run  People who made valuable contributions to the network  such as employees and power users  would receive bigger stakes and more voting power  And users would have a seat at the table for major decisions about the platform s operations It s exceedingly unlikely that Mark Zuckerberg  who has fought hard to keep control of Facebook  will ever convert the company into a user owned and run collective  But Mr  Schneider believes that giving more control to responsible users could help restore trust in the network  and signal the kind of values Mr  Zuckerberg says he wants Facebook to represent      Newsletter Sign Up     Continue reading the main story         Interested in All Things Tech     The Bits newsletter will keep you updated on the latest from

Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Create a Social FederationAnother radical approach would be to make social networks work more like email   so that independent apps could seamlessly work together with one another  across a common protocol Instead of one big Facebook  a federated social network would look like clusters of independent nodes   Mombook and Athletebook and Gamerbook   all of which could be plugged into the umbrella network when it made sense  Rather than requiring a one size fits all set of policies that apply to billions of users  these nodes could be designed to reflect users  priorities   A network for privacy hawks and one for open sharing maximalists could have different data retention rules  and a network for L G B T  users and one for evangelical pastors could have different hate speech rules   If a node became too toxic  it could be removed without shutting down the entire network  Email is the most resilient social network on the internet   Mr  Schneider said   and the thing that allows it to adapt is that it s an open protocol  and people build apps on top of it  and we evolve how we use it  Versions of this kind of network already exist  Mastodon  a decentralized Twitter like social network  has gotten more than a million registered users since its debut in 2016  And various social networks based on the blockchain   the ledger system that underlies virtual currencies like Bitcoin   have sprung up in recent months To be sure  decentralized networks have their own problems  They re messy to administer  and they can still be gamed by bad actors  They can also fall prey to the same kind of privacy issues that Facebook is being criticized for   In fact  part of the reason users are angry at Facebook right now is that the company s data infrastructure was too open  and made it overly simple for third party app developers to take user information outside Facebook  None of this is a panacea  But experimenting with more decentralized models could give social media users a sense that platforms represented their interests  rather than those of a faceless corporation Put Expiration Dates on Social GraphsA single friend of mine once remarked that the major difference among dating apps like OKCupid  Tinder and Bumble wasn t the way they were designed or the companies behind them   it was how long they had existed           Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  New apps  she said  were more likely to attract interesting and smart people who were actually looking for dates  Older apps  by contrast  were eventually overrun with creeps and predators  no matter how well built they were A similar theory might apply to social networks  Facebook  Twitter  YouTube  Instagram and Snapchat all had plenty of issues in their early years  but they were by and large cleaner  with fewer types of exploitation and malicious behavior  Today  the enormous size and influence of these platforms have made them irresistible honey pots for bad actors  and many of our  social graphs    Facebook s term for the webs of digital connections we create   are clogged with years  worth of clutter In a blog post last year  the venture capitalist Hunter Walk proposed an interesting idea  a legally mandated  start over  button that  when pressed  would allow users of social networks to delete all their data  clear out their feeds and friend lists  and begin with a fresh account   I d go even further  and suggest that social networks give their users an automatic  self cleaning  option  which would regularly clear their profiles of apps they no longer used  friendships and followers they no longer interacted with  and data they no longer needed to store  If these tools were enabled  users would need to take affirmative action if they didn t want their information to disappear after a certain number of months or years Making social graphs temporary  rather than preserving them forever by default  would undoubtedly be bad for most social networks  business models  But it could create new and healthy norms around privacy and data hygiene  and it would keep problems from piling up as networks get older and more crowded  It might even recapture some of the magic of the original social networks  when things were fresh and fascinating  and not quite so scary                Correction  March 29

s privacy practices on Monday  as the fallout from the company s relationship with a political data firm continued to spread Early in the day  the Federal Trade Commission confirmed reports that it was investigating how Facebook handles information about its users Soon after  Senator Charles E  Grassley  Republican of Iowa and chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee  invited Mark Zuckerberg  Facebook s chief executive  to testify about privacy standards next month  He also extended invitations to Google s chief executive  Sundar Pichai  and Twitter s chief executive  Jack Dorsey And a group of 37 attorneys general sent Mr  Zuckerberg a letter asking for details about Facebook s privacy safeguards           Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  But one group of people interested in Facebook   investors   had a muted reaction to the growing regulatory threat  Shares of Facebook fell sharply after the F T C  confirmed its investigation but ended the day up 0 4 percent as overall trading on Wall Street recovered from a big drop last week         Continue reading the main story                                Advertisement  Continue reading the main story                      The federal investigation and threats followed recent news that the data collection firm Cambridge Analytica  which worked on the 2016 Trump presidential campaign  gained access to the personal data of more than 50 million Facebook users The F T C  said it planned to determine whether the social media giant had violated a consent decree it signed in 2011 to protect users  privacy The decree required Facebook to notify and receive explicit permission from users before sharing their personal information beyond the limits dictated by their privacy settings  Each violation of the agreement  which the agency reached with Facebook as part of a settlement over third party apps  carries a penalty of up to  40 000 a day The agency s acknowledgment of its investigation helped push Facebook s stock down as much as 6 5 percent on Monday morning before it recovered  Facebook said last week that it was anticipating an inquiry by the agency The F T C  said in a statement on Monday that it  takes very seriously recent press reports raising substantial concerns about the privacy practices of Facebook  Lawmakers have repeatedly called for Mr  Zuckerberg to appear in hearings on Capitol Hill  Last week  the Republican and Democratic leaders of the House and Senate commerce committees formally invited him to testify  I m sure this is much bigger than Cambridge Analytica  and I m sure there are other Cambridge Analyticas out there   Senator John Kennedy  Republican from Louisiana  said in an interview   Facebook isn t just a company  It is so powerful it is like a country            Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Some lawmakers  such as Senator Richard Blumenthal  Democrat from Connecticut  asked the F T C  to look into whether Facebook should pay damages to users  The sphere of scrutiny must be broader than just the consent decree   he said in a statement   There is no excuse for delay       Newsletter Sign Up     Continue reading the main story

intense criticism  too  On Monday  Common Cause  a government watchdog group in Washington  filed complaints seeking federal investigations into allegations that the company violated federal election law In an article that detailed how Cambridge Analytica obtained information about millions of Facebook users  The New York Times reported this month that employees of the data research firm with European or Canadian citizenship had worked extensively for its American clients during the 2014 and 2016 elections  despite a warning from its own election lawyer The employees worked on polling  message development  and the designing of target audiences for digital ads and fund raising appeals The company said the work was permissible because none of the foreign employees had  strategic  or  operational  roles  But former employees contradicted that account  suggesting that the work violated laws in the United States that strictly limit what non Americans can do for American political campaigns Common Cause filed one complaint with the Justice Department  which has authority to investigate  knowing and willful  violations of campaign law  The group also filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission  which has day to day jurisdiction over enforcing election rules  It defies belief that even after their own attorney warned them that they would be violating the prohibition on performing certain election related activities in U S  elections that they did so anyway   said Paul S  Ryan  Common Cause s vice president for policy and litigation In the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco  lawyers appealed two lawsuits that challenged the social media company s privacy and user data policies  One lawsuit claims that Facebook violates the Electronic Communications Privacy Act  Wiretap Act  and state law equivalents because of the way it monitors its users on and off the platform           Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  The second suit claims that Facebook has been capturing and selling the details of users  browsing of third party health sites  Any site with a Facebook  like  button  including those of medical institutions such as the American Cancer Society and the American Society of Clinical Oncology  could be used to track users as they browsed outside Facebook  according to the lawsuit Facebook also has been targeted by several shareholder lawsuits since the reports detailing Cambridge Analytica s use of Facebook user information Video            Why Leaving Facebook Doesn t Always Mean Quitting                                        In the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal  in which data from over 50 million Facebook profiles was secretly scraped and mined for voter insights  many Facebook users have decided to delete their accounts   but untangling yourself from a site like Facebook is not as easy as pressing  delete

                                                  Many users have threatened to deactivate or delete their accounts to protest Facebook s stewardship of their personal data  The  deletefacebook campaign  as it has been called  has even received support from a creator of WhatsApp  one of Facebook s most popular services  who sold his company to the social media giant for  19 billion in 2014  Elon Musk  the chief executive of SpaceX and Tesla  removed the Facebook pages of both companies on Friday While the Cambridge Analytica revelations have renewed regulatory interest in Facebook in the United States  pressure on the company in other countries has been building for years The company has been the subject of several privacy investigations and charges by European regulators  And Europe has approved a new privacy law  which takes effect in May  that will give users of Facebook  Google and other internet services more control over how their data is collected and what Silicon Valley companies know about them                  Follow Tiffany Hsu and Cecilia Kang on Twitter   tiffkhsu   ceciliakangNicholas Confessore and Sheera Frenkel contributed reporting

that has  taken advantage of us like nobody in history  Today  he plans to announce tariffs on at least  50 billion of annual Chinese imports and to impose other penalties in response to the theft of technology and trade secrets  Previously announced tariffs on steel and aluminum imports  which will also affect China  go into effect on Friday China s staggering economic growth has indeed been propelled by unfair trade practices  but experts worry that the president s go it alone approach undermines the potential for collective action   On Wednesday  Mr  Trump appeared to endorse a  1 3 trillion spending deal reached by Congress  Lawmakers must approve the bill by midnight Friday to avoid a government shutdown  Trump lawyer for Russia inquiry resigns  President s Trump s lead lawyer for the special counsel investigation resigned today  according to two people briefed on the matter The lawyer  John Dowd  who took over the president s legal team last summer  had considered leaving several times and ultimately concluded that Mr  Trump was increasingly ignoring his advice  one of the people said           Advertisement  Continue reading the main story    The president has said that he would agree to an interview with the office of the special counsel  Robert Mueller  but Mr  Dowd has said that was a bad idea F B I  investigated Sessions  At the request of Congress  the bureau investigated Attorney General Jeff Sessions for possible perjury last year  after he inaccurately said that he had no contacts with Russians during the presidential campaign  according to three people familiar with the case Andrew McCabe  the F B I  s deputy director at the time  was said to have authorized the inquiry  Mr  McCabe was recently fired   by Mr  Sessions   for showing  lack of candor  in an internal investigation   Separately  John Brennan  a former C I A  director and a pointed critic of President Trump  said that he thought Russia may have compromising information on the president  He later said that his opinion wasn t based on inside knowledge                           The Daily                                                               Listen to  The Daily   Can

ruled in Eisenstadt v  Baird that it s unconstitutional for a state to deny unmarried people access to contraception The court had ruled earlier  in 1965  that state bans on contraceptives for married couples violated their privacy rights  But a few states still restricted access for single people Photo                           Bill Baird in 2012  Forty years earlier  he was involved in a landmark

to the Supreme Court  which struck down the law           Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Justice William Brennan held that the law violated the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment because it discriminated between married and unmarried people The case became an important precedent for landmark rulings by the Supreme Court  including the 1973 decision in Roe v  Wade

activist  but his legacy is complicated by what The Times described in 1993 as an  unapologetic zealotry  and a willingness to criticize  even his ideologic allies   Planned Parenthood once called him

                        Good morning  Want to get California Today by email  Here s the sign up  More than 10 years ago  Arnold Schwarzenegger  then the Republican governor of California  told an audience of conservative leaders that the California Republican Party had moved too far to the right and was  dying at the box office   How right I was   Mr  Schwarzenegger said in a rare return public appearance on Wednesday   The party was going down and down and down  Today we are the Titanic after it hit the iceberg   but before the last bit of the ship submerged  Mr  Schwarzenegger was speaking at a youth center in East Los Angeles marking the start of an organization of moderate California Republicans trying to move the way out of power state party to the center   and back  organizers said  into being a player in state governance  The organization is called New Way California and was put together by Assemblyman Chad Mayes  who was ousted as the Republican minority leader after voting with Democrats on extending the cap and trade automobile emission program  We seek to shed the stereotype of the intolerant Republican Party that serves only the rich and big business   Mr  Mayes said           Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Mr  Schwarzenegger was not the only Republican firepower on stage  John Kasich  the governor of Ohio  who is considering challenging President Trump for the Republican nomination in 2020  was also on hand         Continue reading the main story                                Advertisement  Continue reading the main story                      In Sacramento  the former governor   and occasional actor   broke with national Republicans  at least of today  when he championed environmental protection efforts  including stringent emission controls  In sentiments also reflected by Mr  Kasich and Mr  Mayes  Mr  Schwarzenegger said the Republican Party had to be  environmentally progressive  socially liberal and fiscally conservative  in order to be competitive  Our party is giving them Twitter fights instead of answers   Mr  Schwarzenegger said   And it is sinking us  It is time to return to the issues   The politics of division and anger and resentment can drive a strong base to the polls  yes   he said   But it is tearing our country apart at the seams  And nothing is getting done       Newsletter

s presidential campaign harvested private information from 50 million Facebook profiles have many people wondering  What  if anything  can they do to protect their data connected to the social network Here s the harsh truth  Not much  short of ceasing to browse the web entirely or deleting your Facebook account Yet there are some best practices you can employ to help safeguard your data  such as installing software to block web tracking technologies and carefully vetting the apps that you use on Facebook But it also helps to understand what exactly happened with those 50 million profiles in order to determine how you can better protect your data  Here s what you need to know           Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  So what happened An academic researcher at Cambridge University built an app called thisisyourdigitallife  which offered to pay Facebook users to take a personality test and agree to share that data for academic use  About 270 000 people participated in the study   enough to extract information on tens of millions of Facebooks users         Continue reading the main story                                Advertisement  Continue reading the main story

the app gave consent for the app to collect limited information about their friends whose privacy settings were set to allow it That information was eventually paid for by Cambridge Analytica  the

tools you can install in your browser and settings you can tweak on Facebook  Here s a run down of what you should do   Audit your Facebook apps  If you used Facebook to sign in to a third party website  game or app  those services may continue to access your personal data  On Facebook  go to the settings page and click on the Apps tab to see which apps are connected to your account  From there  you can take a closer look at the permissions you granted to each app to see what information you are sharing  Remove any apps that you find suspicious or no longer use   Facebook has also made some changes to prevent the gathering of detailed information of friends of users  On the App Settings page there is another setting called Apps Others Use  This is where you choose which details are shared about you when your friends use apps  Make sure to uncheck all the boxes if you don t want any of your information  like your birthday or hometown  accessed by your friends  apps   Audit your Facebook privacy settings  If you are concerned about what details apps can see about you and your Facebook friends  now is a good time to check your privacy settings and minimize the information you share publicly  For example  you can make sure that only your friends can see your Facebook posts  or that only you can see your friends list   Read privacy policies  When you sign up for a new app or web tool  the company typically asks you to agree to its terms of service  Make it a habit to peruse the terms and pay particular attention to the privacy policy  If you see language that suggests your data could be shared in a way that makes you uncomfortable  don t use the program   Install a tracker blocker  There are add ons that you can install in your browser that try to block trackers embedded on websites  But be aware that in some cases  they will make parts of websites work improperly  In our tests  Disconnect and Privacy Badger were useful tools for blocking trackers on Google s Chrome browser           Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Here s a primer on how tracking works  to give you a sense of why blockers are important  When you engage with an app on Facebook  it may plant a tracker in your web browser  like a cookie  that collects information from you  Even when you close out of the app  the tracker can continue to follow your activities  like the other sites you visit or the people you interact with through status updates  according to Michael Priem  chief executive of Modern Impact  an advertising firm in Minneapolis  It doesn t go away after you ve stopped looking at the ad   he said   Install an ad blocker  Another way to block trackers is to prevent ads from loading altogether  Ad blockers are also add ons that you can install for your browser on your mobile device or computer  Mobile ads are fully functioning programs  and they sometimes include malware that harvest some of your data  Even the largest websites do not have tight control over the ads that appear on their sites   and sometimes malicious code can appear inside their ad networks  A popular ad blocker among security researchers is uBlock Origin   Clear your browsing data  Periodically  you can clear your cookies and browsing history  Apple  Google and Microsoft have published instructions on how to clear data for their browsers Safari  Chrome and Internet Explorer  That will temporarily delete cookies and trackers  though they will probably reappear over time   Be wary of unknown brands  Even if you read the privacy policies  you still may have to take them with a grain of salt  In the case of the thisisyourdigitallife app  the fine print said the information would be collected for academic use  not commercial purposes  So think twice before sharing information with unfamiliar companies or organizations   Then again  the researcher came from Cambridge University  one of the world s top schools   so who can you really trust

crisis Facebook s chief executive posted a statement on his Facebook page  saying he was taking action to prevent people s data on the social network from being misused           Advertisement  Continue reading the main story   We have a responsibility to protect your data  and if we can t then we don t deserve to serve you   Mr  Zuckerberg wrote   I ve been working to understand exactly what happened and how to make sure this doesn t happen again          Continue reading the main story                                Advertisement  Continue reading the main story                      Here are the steps the company is taking to address the issue    We will investigate all apps that had access to large amounts of information before we changed our platform to dramatically reduce data access in 2014  and we will conduct a full audit of any app with suspicious activity     We will restrict developers  data access even further to prevent other kinds of abuse     We want to make sure you understand which apps you ve allowed to access your data  In the next month  we will show everyone a tool at the top of your News Feed with the apps you ve used and an easy way to revoke those apps  permissions to your data  Mr  Zuckerberg had drawn criticism for his response to how Cambridge Analytica improperly obtained data on 50 million Facebook users  In the days since the news first broke this weekend  he had not commented publicly on the crisis That contrasts with how other tech chief executives have addressed crises at their firms Kevin Roose and Sheera Frenkel of the NYT report When a former engineer revealed a pattern of sexual harassment at Uber last year  Travis Kalanick  then the company s chief executive  said he would immediately open an investigation  When users complained about bugs and problems with the Apple Maps app in 2012  Tim Cook  the company s chief executive  released a statement that said  we fell short   And in 2011  when Netflix tried to split off its mail order DVD business into a company called Qwikster  its chief executive  Reed Hastings  wrote a letter to the public   I messed up   he said   I owe everyone an explanation  So why did it take so long for Mr  Zuckerberg to respond  Kate Losse  an early Facebook employee and Mr  Zuckerberg s former speechwriter  told the NYT   My guess is that what is giving Zuckerberg pause at this point is the question of how to acknowledge and explain this state of affairs while at the same time mitigating the concerns that will come from people finally understanding how this all worked  Peter Eavis s take  There was something missing from Mark Zuckerberg s response   a full explanation of why Facebook took so long to disclose the misuse of its data  As Mr  Zuckerberg noted  Facebook found out in 2015 that Aleksandr Kogan had violated company policies by sharing user data with Cambridge Analytica  Facebook users might ask why the abuse wasn t disclosed at the time  Often it has taken pressure from outsiders to get Facebook to reveal abuses of its network  An alternative approach would have been for Facebook to proactively disclose as much information as possible about the wrongdoing  Facebook users would most likely welcome a strong commitment from Mr  Zuckerberg to do just that Photo                                        Credit             Erin Schaff for The New

questions were about the strength of the economy and pace of future rate increases On those matters  the Federal Reserve has expressed more confidence in the strength of the economy Dot plot  Fed officials signaled they would raise rates at a quicker pace over the next three years  Policymakers now expect to hike rates three times this year  three times in 2019 and twice in 2020  At its December meeting  policymakers expected three rate hikes this year  but just two in 2019           Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Economic projections  Officials raised their median estimates for economic growth this year to 2 7 percent  up from 2 5 percent in December  Fed policymakers also expect inflation to run above 2 percent by 2019 and 2020 Mr  Powell s news conference  The new Fed chairman expressed optimism about the current economic picture and said officials were trying to strike a balance between raising rates too slowly or too quickly   We re trying to take that middle ground  Mr  Powell left the door open to more or fewer than three increases this year  depending on economic conditions   Like any set of forecasts  those forecasts will change over time   he said   It could change up  It could change down On inflation  he added   There is no sense in the data that we re on the cusp of an acceleration of inflation  We have seen moderate increases in wages and price inflation  And we seem to be seeing more of that  Photo                                        Credit             Saumya Khandelwal Reuters                     Why driverless cars are essential to Uber s future The answer has to do with car ownership  For years  Uber and its rivals have promoted the idea that people living in urban areas will turn to Uber to get to and from work and to run errands rather than buy a car If Uber can become an alternative to car ownership  that would greatly increase its potential market A study last year from the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute  Texas A M Transportation Institute  and Columbia University suggested that people might make the switch But for people give up their cars  the cost of using Uber would most likely have to fall far below current levels  The need for this drop in costs came up when Dara Khosrowshahi  the C E O  of Uber  recently sat down for an interview with David Solomon  president and C O O  of Goldman Sachs           Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Here s the write up of the autonomous car portion of their conversation in a recent Goldman note to clients  Uber stressed the importance not only of autonomous technology for the future of the company  but also the value it can create from developing that technology within its existing network  In order for Uber to truly become a legitimate alternative to car ownership it must take its per mile cost below the cost of car ownership  or  0 80  0 90 mile  from the  2 50 mile it costs on average today for an UberX  according to management  While initiatives like pooling  50  of rides in some cities  and driver density can help to lower costs  autonomous is the single most transformative piece of the equation  Uber expects to partner aggressively on this front  noting that  winning  is making sure every single autonomous player is plugged into its network  Calculating the fallout from the Uber self driving car death The pedestrian fatality in Arizona is perhaps Dara Khosrowshahi s first major test as Uber s C E O   leaving him with a difficult choice  keep spending on a technology that Uber considers essential to its future  or dial back to reduce risks ahead of an I P O  Investigators are also looking into whether the victim s actions   suddenly stepping onto a darkened street

                                              For much of the past week  Facebook has been embroiled in a controversy involving Cambridge Analytica  a political consulting firm with ties to Donald J  Trump s 2016 presidential campaign  and how the firm improperly obtained and exploited personal data from 50 million Facebook users On Wednesday  following widespread questions about his whereabouts  Mark Zuckerberg  the chief executive of Facebook  spoke with two New York Times reporters  Sheera Frenkel and Kevin Roose  about the controversy and the steps he was taking to make the social network

conversation  edited for length and clarity Sheera Frenkel  Did it come as a surprise to you  the user response to the news that Cambridge Analytica had accessed this trove of data Mark Zuckerberg  Privacy issues have always been incredibly important to people  One of our biggest responsibilities is to protect data  If you think about what our services are  at their most basic level  you put some content into a service  whether it s a photo or a video or a text message   whether it s Facebook or WhatsApp or Instagram   and you re trusting that that content is going to be shared with the people you want to share it with  Whenever there s an issue where someone s data gets passed to someone who the rules of the system shouldn t have allowed it to  that s rightfully a big issue and deserves to be a big uproar           Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Frenkel  It took quite a few days for your response to come out  Is that because you were weighing these three action points that you noted in your post         Continue reading the main story                                Advertisement  Continue reading the main story                      Zuckerberg  The first thing is  I really wanted to make sure we had a full and accurate understanding of everything that happened  I know that there was a lot of pressure to speak sooner  but my assessment was that it was more important that what we said was fully accurate The second thing is  the most important thing is that we fix this system so that issues like this don t happen again  It s not like there aren t going to be other different kind of things we ll also have to fix  But when there s a certain problem  we have a responsibility to at least make sure we resolve that problem So the actions here that we re going to do involve first  dramatically reducing the amount of data that developers have access to  so that apps and developers can t do what Kogan did here  The most important actions there we actually took three or four years ago  in 2014  But when we examined the systems this week  there were certainly other things we felt we should lock down  too  So we re going ahead and doing that Even if you solve the problem going forward  there s still this issue of  Are there other Cambridge Analyticas out there  or other Kogans who  when the platform worked a certain way in the past  were there apps which could have gotten access to more information  and potentially sold it without us knowing  or done something that violated people s trust  We also need to make sure we get that under control  That s why we spent a lot of time figuring out  O K  here s what it s going to take to do a full investigation of every app that got access to a large amount of information before we changed the platform policies to dramatically reduce the data access that developers had  For any app that we uncover that has any suspicious activity  we re going to go do a full forensic audit  and make sure we have the capacity to do that  to make sure that other developers aren t doing what Kogan did here The third thing is  it s really important that people know what apps they ve authorized  A lot of people have been on Facebook now for five or 10 years  and sometimes you signed into an app a long time ago and you may have forgotten about that  So one of the steps we re taking is making it so apps can no longer access data after you haven t used them for three months But it s also just really important to put in front of people a tool of  here are all the apps you ve connected to and authorized  here s an easy way to deauthorize them  to revoke their permission to get access to your activity Kevin Roose  Is Facebook planning to notify the 50 million users whose data was shared with Cambridge Analytica           Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Zuckerberg  Yes  We re going to tell anyone whose data may have been shared Now  there s a question of whether we have the exact record in our systems today of who your friends were on that day when there was access three and a half or four years ago  so we re going to be conservative on that and try to tell anyone whose data may have been affected  even if we don t know for certain that they were  It s likely that we ll build a tool like we did with the Russian misinformation investigation  that anyone can go to it and see if their data was affected by this Roose  Do you have a preliminary estimate of how many apps you ll be investigating Zuckerberg  It will be in the thousands Frenkel  Were those app developers notified that you ll be investigating this yet Zuckerberg  Just when I posted  And we ll be reaching out in the near term Frenkel  Are you going to be hiring people to help conduct those investigations Zuckerberg  Yes  I would imagine we re going to have to grow the team to work on this Roose  You mentioned a contract that developers will have to sign in order to ask anyone for access to broader profile information  What will be the terms of that contract  and what will be the penalties for violating it Zuckerberg  So  the important thing there is that it s a high touch process  The specific point we were trying to make is that it s not going to be some terms of service that a developer can sign up for just on their computer when developing something  I guess technically  that would be a contract as well The point of what we re trying to do here is to create a situation where we have a real person to person relationship with any developer who is asking for the most sensitive data  That doesn t mean that   if you re a developer and you want to put Facebook Login on your website  you can do that  If you want to get access to ask people for their religious affiliation  or their sexual orientation  for data that could be very sensitive  we want to make sure we have a clear relationship with those people Frenkel  We understood that Cambridge Analytica had reached out to Facebook and asked that its ban on the platform be reconsidered  Are you giving any thought to allowing Cambridge Analytica back in           Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Zuckerberg  The first thing we need to do is conduct this full forensic audit of the firm  that they don t have any people s data from our community and that they ve deleted anything  including derivative data  that they might have  We re working with the regulator in the U K  on this  so our forensic audit was actually paused in the near term to cede the way for the ICO there to do their own government investigation  We re certainly not going to consider letting them back onto the platform until we have full confirmation that there s no wrongdoing here Roose  There were reports as far back as 2015 that Cambridge Analytica had access to this data set  Why didn t you suspend them then Zuckerberg  So  we actually heard  I think it was at the end of 2015   some journalists from The Guardian reached out to us and told us what you just said  And it was not just about Cambridge Analytica  it was about this developer  Aleksandr Kogan  who had shared data with them      Newsletter

or contact us anytime       We took action immediately at that point  We banned Kogan s app from the platform  we demanded that Kogan and Cambridge Analytica and a couple other parties that Kogan had shared the data with would legally certify that they didn t have the data  and weren t using it in any of their operations  They gave us that formal certification  At the time  they told us they never had gotten access to raw Facebook data  so we made that decision Frenkel  In retrospect  do you wish you had demanded proof that the data had been deleted Zuckerberg  Yes  They gave us a formal and legal certification  and it seems at this point that that was false Again  we haven t done our full investigation and audit yet so I can t say definitively that they actually have data  I ve just read all the same reports that you have  including in The New York Times  that says that journalists have seen evidence that they have the data  which is a strong enough signal for us to go on  and take action here That s the basic driver behind us now needing to go and do a full investigation into any app that had access to a large amount of data before we locked down the platform policies in 2014  Just having folks tell us that they were using the data correctly  I think  does not satisfy our responsibility to our community to protect their data Frenkel  Are you actively looking at some of these dark web data brokers that have been in news reports recently  that say that other independent researchers are potentially trading in this data           Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Zuckerberg  Yes  we re investigating that too Roose  Are you worried about the  DeleteFacebook campaign that s been going around  Have you seen meaningful numbers of people deleting their accounts  and are you worried that will be a trend Zuckerberg  I don t think we ve seen a meaningful number of people act on that  but  you know  it s not good  I think it s a clear signal that this is a major trust issue for people  and I understand that  And whether people delete their app over it or just don t feel good about using Facebook  that s a big issue that I think we have a responsibility to rectify Frenkel  We re now heading into the 2018 midterms  Could you speak about what Facebook is going to do ahead of the 2018 midterms to make people feel more confident that the platform won t be used this way again Zuckerberg  This is an incredibly important point  There s no doubt that in 2016  there were a number of issues including foreign interference and false news that we did not have as much of a handle on as we feel a responsibility to for our community Now  the good news here is that these problems aren t necessarily rocket science  They re hard  but they re things that if you invest and work on making it harder for adversaries to do what they re trying to do  you can really reduce the amount of false news  make it harder for foreign governments to interfere One of the things that gives me confidence is that we ve seen a number of elections at this point where this has gone a lot better  In the months after the 2016 election  there was the French election  The new A I  tools we built after the 2016 elections found  I think  more than 30 000 fake accounts that we believe were linked to Russian sources who were trying to do the same kind of tactics they did in the U S  in the 2016 election  We were able to disable them and prevent that from happening on a large scale in France In last year  in 2017 with the special election in Alabama  we deployed some new A I  tools to identify fake accounts and false news  and we found a significant number of Macedonian accounts that were trying to spread false news  and were able to eliminate those  And that  actually  is something I haven t talked about publicly before  so you re the first people I m telling about that I feel a lot better about the systems now  At the same time  I think Russia and other governments are going to get more sophisticated in what they do  too  So we need to make sure that we up our game  This is a massive focus for us to make sure we re dialed in for not only the 2018 elections in the U S   but the Indian elections  the Brazilian elections  and a number of other elections that are going on this year that are really important           Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Frenkel  The Times reported that  Facebook chief security officer Alex  Stamos will be leaving toward the end of this year  Is there a broader plan for how Facebook is going to structure security on its platform ahead of all these important elections Zuckerberg  Sure  One of the important things we ve done is  we want to unify all of our security efforts  And you reported on a reorg around Alex Stamos  and I ll say something about him in a second  He s been a very valuable contributor here and was a really central figure in helping us identify the foreign interference with Russia  And I think he has done very good work  and I m hopeful he ll be engaged for a while here on that One of the big things we needed to do is coordinate our efforts a lot better across the whole company  It s not all A I   right  There s certainly a lot that A I  can do  we can train classifiers to identify content  but most of what we do is identify things that people should look at  So we re going to double the amount of people working on security this year  We ll have more than 20 000 people working on security and community operations by the end of the year  I think we have about 15 000 now  So it s really the technical systems we have working with the people in our operations functions that make the biggest deal The last thing I d add on this  Take things like false news  You know  a lot of it is really spam  if you think about it  It s the same people who might have been sending you Viagra emails in the  90s  now they re trying to come up with sensational content and push it into Facebook and other apps in order to get you to click on it and see ads  There are some pretty basic policy decisions we ve made  like O K   if you re anywhere close to being a fake news site  you can t put Facebook ads on your site  right  So then suddenly  it becomes harder for them to make money  If you make it hard enough for them to make money  they just kind of go and do something else Roose  Is the basic economic model of Facebook  in which users provide data that Facebook uses to help advertisers and developers to better target potential customers and users   do you feel like that works  given what we now know about the risks Zuckerberg  Yeah  so this is a really important question  The thing about the ad model that is really important that aligns with our mission is that   our mission is to build a community for everyone in the world and to bring the world closer together  And a really important part of that is making a service that people can afford  A lot of the people  once you get past the first billion people  can t afford to pay a lot  Therefore  having it be free and have a business model that is ad supported ends up being really important and aligned Now  over time  might there be ways for people who can afford it to pay a different way  That s certainly something we ve thought about over time  But I don t think the ad model is going to go away  because I think fundamentally  it s important to have a service like this that everyone in the world can use  and the only way to do that is to have it be very cheap or free Roose  Adam Mosseri  Facebook s head of News Feed  recently said he had lost some sleep over Facebook s role in the violence in Myanmar  You ve said you re  outraged  about what happened with Cambridge Analytica  but when you think about the many things that are happening with Facebook all over the world  are you losing any sleep  Do you feel any guilt about the role Facebook is playing in the world           Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Zuckerberg  That s a good question  I think  you know  we re doing something here which is unprecedented  in terms of building a community for people all over the world to be able to share what matters to them  and connect across boundaries  I think what we re seeing is  there are new challenges that I don t think anyone had anticipated before If you had asked me  when I got started with Facebook  if one of the central things I d need to work on now is preventing governments from interfering in each other s elections  there s no way I thought that s what I d be doing  if we talked in 2004 in my dorm room   I don t know that it s possible to know every issue that you re going to face down the road  But we have a real responsibility to take all these issues seriously as they come up  and work with experts and people around the world to make sure we solve them  and do a good job for our community It s certainly true that  over the course of Facebook  I ve made all kinds of different mistakes  whether that s technical mistakes or business mistakes or hiring mistakes  We ve launched product after product that didn t work  I spend most of my time looking forward  trying to figure out how to solve the issues that people are having today  because I think that s what people in our community would want                  Follow Kevin

                        WASHINGTON   The political action committee founded by John R  Bolton  President Trump s incoming national security adviser  was one of the earliest customers of Cambridge Analytica  which it hired specifically to develop psychological profiles of voters with data harvested from tens of millions of Facebook profiles  according to former Cambridge employees and company documents Mr  Bolton s political committee  known as The John Bolton Super PAC  first hired Cambridge in August 2014  months after the political data firm was founded and while it was still harvesting the Facebook data In the two years that followed  Mr  Bolton s super PAC spent nearly  1 2 million primarily for  survey research   which is a term that campaigns use for polling  according to campaign finance records But the contract between the political action committee and Cambridge  a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times  offers more detail on just what Mr  Bolton was buying  The contract broadly describes the services to be delivered by Cambridge as  behavioral microtargeting with psychographic messaging            Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  To do that work  Cambridge used Facebook data  according to the documents and two former employees familiar with the work         Continue reading the main story                                Advertisement  Continue reading the main story                       The data and modeling Bolton s PAC received was derived from the Facebook data   said Christopher Wylie  a data expert who was part of the team that founded Cambridge Analytica   We definitely told them about how we were doing it  We talked about it in conference calls  in meetings  Cambridge Analytica  which rose to prominence through its work with Mr  Trump s 2016 election campaign  has found itself confronting a deepening crisis since reports this past weekend in The New York Times and The Observer of London that the firm had harvested the data from more than 50 million Facebook profiles in its bid to develop techniques for predicting the behavior of individual American voters Cambridge s so called psychographic modeling techniques  which were built in part with the data harvested from Facebook  underpinned its work for Mr  Trump s campaign in 2016  setting off a furious   and still unsettled   debate about whether the firm s technology worked  The same techniques were also the focus of its work for Mr  Bolton s super PAC  The Bolton PAC was obsessed with how America was becoming limp wristed and spineless and it wanted research and messaging for national security issues   Mr  Wylie said  That really meant making people more militaristic in their worldview   he added   That s what they said they wanted  anyway  Using the psychographic models  Cambridge helped design concepts for advertisements for candidates supported by Mr  Bolton s PAC  including the 2014 campaign of Thom Tillis  the Republican senator from North Carolina  according to Mr  Wylie and another former employee  who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid being dragged into the investigations that now appear to be engulfing Cambridge One advertisement  a video that was posted on YouTube  was aimed at people who scored high for conscientiousness  and were thought to respect hard work and experience  It emphasized Mr  Bolton s time working for Ronald Reagan and how Mr  Tillis embodied the spirit and political ethos of the late president      Keep America Secure  For Our Children  Video by Team John

in 2014 with a  15 million investment from Mr  Mercer  whose daughter Rebekah sits on the firm s board of directors  Stephen K  Bannon was also a co founder At the same time  Mr  Mercer was financially supporting Mr  Bolton s PAC  donating  5 million between April 2014 and September 2016  according to Federal Election Commission filings  The Mercers also backed Mr  Trump in the presidential election The Mercer family has not publicly commented since the reports about the misuse of Facebook data by Cambridge first surfaced in The Times and The Observer The reports have prompted calls from lawmakers in Britain and the United States for renewed scrutiny of Facebook  and at least two American state prosecutors have said they are looking into the misuse of data by Cambridge Analytica The company also suspended its chief executive  Alexander Nix  after a television broadcast this week in which he was recorded suggesting that the company had used seduction and bribery to entrap politicians and influence foreign elections But it is the harvesting of Facebook data that has cast the harshest spotlight on Cambridge  and Mr  Bolton s experience with the company appears to have provided a model for how it sold itself to future political campaigns  including Mr  Trump s           Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  The firm took the psychographic profiles it was building off the Facebook data at the time and combined them with voter databases and other sets of data  Staff from SCL s elections division  which through a convoluted corporate structure was interchangeable with Cambridge  discussed what they were doing at a meeting in July 2014 with another contractor for the Bolton PAC  according to an agenda of the meeting obtained by The Times The profiles would be used to  identify the personality traits of individuals  in states to be targeted by the Bolton PAC  said the agenda  which was prepared for SCL and Cambridge staff   Individuals can be targeted with the right message   it said The agenda also included a line  in boldfaced text  that said SCL wanted to use voter contact lists available to Bolton s campaign to direct people  toward the FB app   Cambridge  working through an outside researcher  used a Facebook app to harvest data from the social network s profiles  The app claimed to be collecting data for academic research  and users were not aware of its true purpose Months later  the relationship between Cambridge and the Bolton PAC had grown so close that the firm was writing up talking points for Mr  Bolton  In an email dated Oct  1  2014  Cambridge staff outlined a few sentences that Mr  Bolton could use to describe the work the new firm was doing for his super PAC  It s not just about how much you spend  It s also about how smart you spend   the email advised Mr  Bolton to say    One way we re doing that is by enlisting an outside firm    Cambridge Analytica    to provide deepdive research into who makes up our audience of target voters   it continued   We are producing ads specifically designed for voters of a certain personality and demographic profile  So if you re a young woman in New Hampshire with a specific kind of personality and a particular set of issues that you care about  our research allows us to connect with that voter in a way that truly resonates with her

                                                    LONDON   The whistle blower Christopher Wylie held a roomful of British lawmakers rapt for three and a half hours on Tuesday  like a pink haired  nose ringed oracle sent from the future to explain data In testimony to the House of Commons  select committee on culture  Mr  Wylie  a 28 year old Canadian  described the inner workings of SCL  a political consultancy that gave its clients access to a vast collection of personal information harvested from Facebook In one of the longest sessions in recent memory  Mr  Wylie made a number of jaw dropping assertions  most significantly that the company s exploitation of personal data had swung the results of Britain s 2016 referendum on leaving the European Union  He also suggested that his predecessor at Cambridge Analytica was murdered But mostly  Mr  Wylie tried to explain data mining  He looked like a cerebral skate rat  which might in other circumstances have undermined his credibility  but in this case it seemed to help  He was polite  He resembled  as one journalist put it   a patient grandson trying to set up a Skype call with his gran            Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  His message was clear  If you aren t already worried about how your personal data is being used  now would be a good time to start   The way I like to think of it  data is the electricity of our new economy  and electricity can be quite dangerous   he said   We enjoy the benefits of electricity  despite the fact that it can literally kill you          Continue

contractor who left in July 2014 and has no direct knowledge of our work or practices since then   It said Cambridge Analytica  a subsidiary of the SCL political consultancy  did not use its cache of data in Donald J  Trump s 2016 campaign  and had no involvement in the European Union referendum that ended with a victory for those who support withdrawal  or Brexit  from the bloc Mr  Wylie s testimony bluntly contradicted that of his former boss  Alexander Nix  who has recently appeared before the same committee twice  Mr  Wylie said a cluster of pro Brexit organizations employed a Canadian subsidiary company  Aggregate IQ  which provided them with SCL s store of data  I think it is completely reasonable to say that there could have been a different outcome of the referendum had there not been  in my view  cheating   he said He also suggested that Russian intelligence agencies could have easily scooped up the company s vast library of data on American voters in advance of the 2016 elections in the United States  because Aleksandr Kogan  the scientist who collected it  made regular return trips to Russia  Put a key logger in Kogan s computer in Russia and you ve got everything   Mr  Wylie said  He added   It would make it incredibly easy for them to get access to this data  For me  that s concerning and I think it should be looked into  Mr  Wylie s appearance has coincided with a surge of collective dismay over data mining  and many found themselves riveted by his testimony on Tuesday  Georgia Rakusen  33  a user researcher at a technology firm in London  urged her Twitter followers to tune into the hearing  which she called  absolutely gripping stuff  His testimony  she said   was something that  as a lay person  you could watch and start to grasp the enormity of how your data is used       Newsletter Sign Up     Continue reading the main story            headline   The Interpreter Newsletter   summary   Understand the world with sharp insight and

it s not just about ads  maybe it s not just what bands I like   she said  Ms  Rakusen  who described her own work as  a space where we are supposed to make people click more   said she hoped that employees of large technology companies would come forward more  looking at whistle blowers like Mr  Wylie and Edward J  Snowden           Advertisement  Continue reading the main story   I didn t watch the whole three and a half hours   she said   But I basically didn t get any other work done during that time  Mr  Wylie  who has described himself a  gay Canadian vegan   dropped out of high school but discovered a genius for coding and  still in his teens  began working for political campaigns  He came close to losing his composure at only one moment on Tuesday  when he was asked what prompted him to turn against the technology he had helped create  He said his views had changed when Mr  Trump was elected  It was no longer this niche  shady firm   he said   It was a firm that was making a massive impact on the world  It s a process of coming to terms with what you have created  and the impact that has had   I am incredibly remorseful for my role in setting it up   he added  his voice wavering   I m the first person to say that I should have known better  But what s done is done  He was caustic on the subject of his former boss  Mr  Nix  who he said enjoyed the colonial challenge of manipulating the affairs of less developed countries  He recalled that once  they were late to a meeting because Mr  Nix had to collect a chandelier he had bought for  283 000  You have to remember that a lot of these people are very wealthy already   he said   The thing that I learned is for certain wealthy people  they need something to keep them occupied  They need projects  And for certain wealthy people  going into the developing world and running a country is something that appeals to them  At times  he seemed slightly pitying of British officials who are investigating data mining  saying they did not have enough resources and lacked a  robust technical background   I have had to explain and re explain and re explain and re explain  you know  how relational databases work  what is an eigenvector  what is dimensionality reduction   he said  They have been working really  really hard  But as a point of observation  one of the weak points that I ve seen   again  this is an empathetic criticism   is the lack of technical people   he said  apparently searching for a polite way to say it   They have had to ask me a lot of questions that a database engineer would not ask                                             A version of this article appears in print on March 28  2018  on Page A4 of the New York edition with the headline  Data Mining Swung

                        We also made mistakes  there s more to do  and we need to step up and do it   he wrote in his Facebook statement The Cambridge Analytica revelations added to the questions that have been raised about Facebook s handling of user data and security  Those questions have only intensified as the company has faced criticism over the role its platform played in Russian attempts to influence the 2016 presidential election and the way it has been used to spread misinformation on the internet The resulting backlash is Facebook s worst crisis since it was founded by Mr  Zuckerberg and others in 2004  The information  photos and other content that users post and their frequent engagement with the platform is crucial to the social network  and to the company s profitability  Questions about user privacy and security threaten the company s standing at a time when people are already uneasy about whether the use of technology can bring good or ill Last Friday  after The New York Times  The Observer of London and Channel 4 in Britain told Facebook that Cambridge Analytica had not deleted all of the data it had obtained  the social network banned the political consulting firm and Aleksandr Kogan  the Cambridge University researcher who created the personality quiz app that was used to harvest user data  This was a breach of trust between Kogan  Cambridge Analytica and Facebook   Mr  Zuckerberg wrote on Wednesday   But it was also a breach of trust between Facebook and the people who share their data with us and expect us to protect it  Facebook representatives confirmed that Cambridge Analytica representatives met with Facebook on Tuesday to discuss lifting the ban  Mr  Zuckerberg told The Times he did not rule out allowing Cambridge Analytica back  saying Facebook must first conduct a  full forensic audit of the firm  and  have full confirmation that there s no wrongdoing here            Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  The reaction to the Cambridge Analytica disclosure has been severe  Politicians in the United States and Britain have called for Mr  Zuckerberg to explain how his company handles user data  and state attorneys

Wednesday of a bill to combat sex trafficking  The bill would lift liability protections that internet companies have enjoyed for content that users post on their platforms  Facebook and other internet giants had quietly fought the bill for more than a year  but eventually dropped their opposition Lawmakers who have demanded that Mr  Zuckerberg testify before Congress about Facebook s relationship with Cambridge Analytica were not appeased by his statement  You need to come to Congress and testify to this under oath   Senator Ed Markey  Democrat of Massachusetts  tweeted in response to Mr  Zuckerberg s post Independent researchers who have used data from Facebook said that Mr  Zuckerberg s statement did not acknowledge how the gathering of user data was fundamental to the company s operations  He avoided the big issue  which is that for many years  Facebook was basically giving away user data like it was handing out candy   said Jonathan Albright  research director at the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University   There is no question that handing out that data made Facebook the success it is as a company  This has to be recognized as part of their business model and not just a one off problem  In his statement  Mr  Zuckerberg laid out a timeline of Facebook s dealings with Cambridge Analytica  He traced the information sharing issue to 2007  when Facebook decided to become an open platform   enabling people to use Facebook to log into other apps and share detailed personal information about themselves and their friends In 2013  Mr  Kogan  the Cambridge researcher  created a personality quiz app that about 300 000 people installed  Mr  Zuckerberg wrote  Because Facebook was an open platform  Mr  Kogan was able to collect data on tens of millions of friends of those users who had installed the personality quiz app           Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  A year later  Mr  Zuckerberg said  Facebook changed its policy to limit how much data third party apps could access   These actions would prevent any app like Kogan s from being able to access so much data today   he wrote By 2015  Mr  Kogan had shared his data and findings with Cambridge Analytica  which later used the material to single out American voters  Mr  Zuckerberg said Facebook had banned Mr  Kogan s app and demanded that the researcher and Cambridge Analytica formally certify that the data had been deleted  He did not address in his post why Facebook had not already disclosed those activities to its users whose data had been harvested by Mr  Kogan and Cambridge Analytica  Whenever there s an issue where someone s data gets passed to someone who the rules of the system shouldn t have allowed it to  that s rightfully a big issue and deserves to be a big uproar   Mr  Zuckerberg said in the interview For Mr  Zuckerberg  the outcry over Cambridge Analytica has been personally damaging  Inside Facebook  even his staunch supporters have described a tense atmosphere  Some employees have sought to transfer to other divisions  such as the messaging app WhatsApp and the photo sharing platform Instagram  calling their work on Facebook s main product  demoralizing  Mr  Zuckerberg spent part of the past week hunkered down with a small group of engineers to discuss how to make information on Facebook s users more secure  and to potentially give them more control of their data  according to two Facebook employees who declined to be named because the proceedings were confidential His silence on the matter has prompted mounting criticism in the past few days  Facebook held a staff meeting on Tuesday to answer questions about Cambridge Analytica and the surrounding outcry  but Mr  Zuckerberg did not appear at the event  He was scheduled to appear at a staff meeting that was set for Friday   In his interview with The Times  Mr  Zuckerberg said that the company s efforts to safeguard its platform from bad behavior   which includes preparing for possible interference attempts in the 2018 midterm elections   were an important part of a larger transformation at the company  which has had to adjust from its roots as a social network for college students into a powerful global information hub  If you had asked me  when I got started with Facebook  if one of the central things I d need to work on now is preventing governments from interfering in each other s elections  there s no way I thought that s what I d be doing if we talked in 2004 in my dorm room   Mr  Zuckerberg said

elections regulator The allegations led to a heated exchange  conducted in the British news media  involving allegations of hard feelings over an old romance and of the deliberate outing by the prime minister s office  No  10 Downing Street  of the former employee as gay The former employee  Shahmir Sanni  said in the interview and in a witness statement submitted to the regulator  the Electoral Commission  that the two advisers had funneled more than  900 000 in campaign spending through a puppet organization that they had set up  They did so  he said  by paying the money to a digital advertising firm that was indirectly linked to the Trump campaign and also worked on the push to exit the European Union Mr  Sanni volunteered at Vote Leave  the main campaign led in part by the two advisers to the prime minister  and then at the organization that he now says was a puppet  called BeLeave  He spoke with The New York Times for a joint reporting project with The Observer of Britain           Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  The allegations are the latest of many raised on both sides of the referendum about the possible diversion of money through allied organizations to get around funding limits on each of them  and campaign finance experts said the multitude of such claims pointed to holes and ambiguities in the regulations that governed the referendum         Continue reading the main story                                Advertisement  Continue reading the main story                      In response  one of the two Downing Street advisers  Stephen Parkinson  said that Vote Leave had adhered to all relevant laws  Mr  Parkinson also suggested that Mr  Sanni was lashing out because the two had  dated for 18 months  before splitting up   I thought amicably   in September 2017  He said he had not spoken to Mr  Sanni as a supervisor from the Vote Leave campaign  but as a friend   That is the capacity in which I gave Shahmir advice and encouragement  and I can understand if the lines became blurred for him   Mr  Parkinson said in the statement   but I am clear that I did not direct the activities of any separate campaign groups  The other adviser  Cleo Watson  could not be reached for comment Mr  Sanni said his relationship with Mr  Parkinson had been a short fling that started after the referendum  In a statement  he said the disclosure of his sexual orientation had endangered his family  who live in Pakistan  and he accused Mr  Parkinson of intimidation  I never imagined that he  with the help of No  10  would choose to tell the world I am gay  in a last  desperate attempt to scare me   Mr  Sanni said His lawyer  Tamsin Allen  said in a statement   We believe this is the first time a Downing Street official statement has been used to out someone  British campaign finance experts said the allegations about Vote Leave underscored the porousness and ineffectiveness of rules on spending around referendums like the vote in 2016 to exit the European Union Photo                           Shahmir Sanni worked with a small team of young volunteers in what was initially a unit of Vote Leave called BeLeave that tried to craft messages to turn young and liberal people against the European Union                                       Credit             Andrew Testa for The New York Times                      They were useless   said Justin Fisher  a professor of political science at Brunel University London who has studied the regulations for the Electoral Commission  which oversees elections and regulates political finance in Britain           Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Multiple organizations  each with its own spending limit  were allowed to campaign in parallel on either side of the referendum issue  and they were allowed to work together in ill defined ways  allowing donors on either side many ways to sidestep spending limits  Mr  Fisher noted The rules  had never really been tested before because we never had a referendum of any consequence before   Mr  Fisher said  noting that in total the supporters of remaining in the European Union had outspent the advocates of leaving Mr  Sanni s allegations have come to light because of a tangle of connections to an online consulting company with ties to the campaign that elected President Trump   Cambridge Analytica Mr  Sanni is friends with Christopher Wylie  a former research director of Cambridge Analytica who has recently provided information to journalists indicating that the company improperly obtained  the data of 50 million Facebook users in order to help target voters The Vote Leave campaign relied heavily for online ad placement on a Canadian company called AggregateIQ  which according to documents and testimony submitted to the Electoral Commission by Mr  Wylie was a satellite business set up to support Cambridge Analytica Public filings also show that Vote Leave provided virtually the entire  990 000 budget of BeLeave   625 000 pounds   which took the form of additional spending paid directly to AggregateIQ As Mr  Wylie was coming forward with his disclosures about Cambridge Analytica  he encouraged his friend Mr  Sanni to come forward with his claims about Vote Leave and BeLeave as well      Newsletter Sign Up     Continue

executives at Cambridge Analytica s parent company  initially licensed all its software from that company  and for a time received virtually all its income from the company In a statement this week  Jeff Silvester  one of the founders of AggregateIQ  said it was a  digital advertising  web and software development company  and  has never managed  nor did we ever have access to  any Facebook data or database allegedly obtained improperly by Cambridge Analytica            Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Mr  Silvester did not address the company s work for Vote Leave and BeLeave  A spokesman for Cambridge Analytica did not respond to a request for comment An initial investigation by the Electoral Commission found nothing improper in the relationship between the two organizations  but a court appeal last fall prompted the commission to reopen its inquiry  Mr  Sanni s testimony is additional information recently submitted to that ongoing inquiry Photo

continued to have access to the Google Drive used for BeLeave s strategy  planning and internal discussion after the referendum  on June 23  2016 Mr  Sanni graduated from the University of East Anglia at the end of 2015  and began volunteering the next March for the Vote Leave campaign  He worked with a small team of young volunteers in what was then a unit of Vote Leave called BeLeave that tried to craft messages to turn young and liberal people against the European Union by arguing  for example  that it closed doors to the non European world The small BeLeave team initially worked in the same office as Vote Leave and under the oversight of its senior staff  including Mr  Parkinson and Ms  Watson  as did two AggregateIQ employees managing the campaign s online advertising  Mr  Sanni testified to the commission By mid May  however  with the referendum little more than a month away  the Vote Leave campaign was nearing its spending cap At about the same time  the leaders of the Vote Leave campaign instructed their lawyers to draw up a charter for BeLeave to become an independent group  Mr  Sanni was named its secretary and research director while another friend  Darren Grimes  was named its principal and campaign director Mr  Sanni told the commission he was surprised to learn that the leaders of Vote Leave had also decided to direct  900 000 to BeLeave  given that it was overseen by two unpaid  inexperienced people  He and Mr  Grimes were then both 22  But then his friend Mr  Grimes explained that virtually all of that money would be paid directly to AggregateIQ for online advertising           Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  In practice  Mr  Sanni said  nothing changed  The BeLeave staff continued to work inside the Vote Leave office  The senior officials of Vote Leave continued to approve their messages  And the same AggregateIQ workers continued to place BeLeave s online advertisements while providing the same service to Vote Leave  We never saw ourselves as a separate organization from the get go   Mr  Sanni said in an interview  echoing his testimony   We were just volunteers  The money paid to AggregateIQ for online advertising produced few results for BeLeave   1 164 email sign ups and 1 005 mobile phone numbers for more than  900 000   leading Mr  Sanni to suspect the money may have gone to promote the larger Vote Leave campaign instead He insisted in the interview that the reason he provided testimony to the commission was not about any past feelings for Mr  Parkinson  now at No  10 Instead  he said  it was out of concern for Mr  Grimes  the other young volunteer  By making Mr  Grimes the nominal owner of BeLeave  the leaders of Vote Leave had made him a target of critical news coverage and potential legal claims  Mr  Sanni argued   He is getting thrown to the dogs   Mr  Sanni said   Everything I am doing is to protect Darren   I now feel sick about what happened   Mr  Sanni said in his testimony  The officials of Vote Leave  used two 22 year olds to cheat in the referendum  Mr  Grimes did not respond to messages seeking comment                                            A version of this article

like  say  Kim Kardashian West  When you hit the thumbs up button on her page  you probably did it because you wanted to see the reality TV star s posts in your news feed  Maybe you realized that marketers could target advertisements to you based on your interest in her What you probably missed is that researchers had figured out how to tie your interest in Ms  Kardashian West to certain personality traits  such as how extroverted you are  very   how conscientious  more than most  and how open minded  only somewhat   And when your fondness for Ms  Kardashian West is combined with other interests you ve indicated on Facebook  researchers believe their algorithms can predict the nuances of your political views with better accuracy than your loved ones As The New York Times reported on Saturday  that is what motivated the consulting firm Cambridge Analytica to collect data from more than 50 million Facebook users  without their consent  to build its own behavioral models to target potential voters in various political campaigns  The company has worked for a political action committee started by John R  Bolton  who served in the George W  Bush administration  as well as for President Trump s presidential campaign in 2016   We find your voters and move them to action   the firm boasts on its website Cambridge Analytica now says it has destroyed the user data it collected on Facebook  Raw data reviewed by The Times suggests the information  or copies of it  may still exist  In either case  specific user information was merely a means to an end  a building block in a far more ambitious construction  a behavioral model powerful enough to manipulate people s activity and  potentially  sway elections           Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  The firm adapted its approach to personality modeling from studies conducted by researchers at Stanford University and the Psychometrics Center at the University of Cambridge  The studies relied on data collected by a Facebook app called myPersonality  a 100 question quiz developed by the Psychometrics Center that assessed a person s openness  conscientiousness  extroversion  agreeableness and neuroticism  traits commonly referred to in the academic community by the acronym Ocean         Continue reading the main story                                Advertisement  Continue reading the main story                      Many respondents who took the quiz through the myPersonality app authorized it to gain access to their Facebook profile data  and information about their friend network   access that was allowed by the social network at the time  That allowed researchers to cross reference the results of the quiz   numeric Ocean scores   with the users  Facebook  likes   and build a model from the correlations they found between the two  With that model  the researchers could often make precise guesses about subsequent users  personalities using only a list of their likes  no 100 question quiz necessary One of the studies the Psychometrics Center produced  published in 2015 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences  was built on the  likes  and Ocean scores of more than 70 000 respondents who took the myPersonality quiz on Facebook  It found that a person who liked the movie  Fight Club   for example  was far more likely to be open to new experiences than a person who liked  American Idol   according to a review of data provided to The Times by Michal Kosinski  an author of the 2015 study and a professor of organizational behavior at Stanford

respondents  personalities Based on a sample of more than 32 000 participants who were assessed by both the model and one or two friends  the researchers found that the model  using just 10 likes  was more accurate than a work colleague  With 70 likes  it was more accurate than a friend or roommate  with 150  more accurate than a family member  and with 300  more accurate than a spouse The model

to Aleksandr Kogan  a psychology professor at Cambridge University who was familiar with the center s work  Dr  Kogan developed a Facebook app called  thisisyourdigitallife   a quiz similar to myPersonality  and used it to harvest data from more than 50 million Facebook profiles  Of those  30 million contained enough information to generate personality profiles  Only 270 000 users authorized Dr  Kogan s app to have access to their data  and all were told that their information was being used for academic research Cambridge then pitched its services to potential political and commercial clients  ranging from Mastercard and the New York Yankees to the Joint Chiefs of Staff Facebook has now banned Cambridge Analytica from its platform  as well as its parent company and Dr  Kogan  In Facebook s eyes  Dr  Kogan s infraction was not collecting the data  but giving it to Cambridge Analytica           Advertisement  Continue reading the main story   Although Kogan gained access to this information in a legitimate way and through the proper channels that governed all developers on Facebook at that time  he did not subsequently abide by our rules   Facebook s deputy general counsel said in a statement on Friday By handing over that information to a private company  Facebook said  Dr  Kogan violated its terms of service Facebook in 2015 changed its policies  including altering rules about how third party apps can gain access to information about users  friends  But user data collected through such apps over the years probably remains in the wild  not to mention the models that can continue to be used to target people around the world                Correction  March 23  2018  An earlier version of this article misstated the title of Michal Kosinski

"AdvertisementSunday ReviewSupported byThe StoneHow Democracy Can Survive Big DataImageCreditIllustration by Yoshi Sodeoka  Photographs by Flashpop Digitalvision  via Getty ImagesBy Colin KoopmanMarch 22  2018Only a few years ago  the idea that for profit companies and foreign agents could use powerful data technologies to disrupt American democracy would have seemed laughable to most  a plotline from a Cold War espionage movie  And the idea that the American system would be compromised enough to allow outside meddling with the most basic of its democratic functions   the election of its leaders   would have seemed even more absurd Today we know that this is not fiction but fact  It is a secret so open that even its perpetrators seem halfhearted about hiding it  Data drives all that we do   That is the motto emblazoned on the website of Cambridge Analytica  the consulting firm that was employed by the Trump campaign to influence voters and that is now under scrutiny for its unauthorized harvesting of data from at least 50 million social media users The heart of Cambridge Analytica s power is an enormous information warehouse   as many as 5 000 data points on each of more than 230 million Americans  according to recent reporting  a fact the company proudly confirms on its website  Its promise of elections driven by data ultimately implies a vision of government steered not by people but by algorithms  and by an expanding data mining culture operating without restrictions That such threats to democracy are now possible is due in part to the fact that our society lacks an information ethics adequate to its deepening dependence on data  Where politics is driven by data  we need a set of ethics to guide that data  But in our rush to deliver on the promises of Big Data  we have not sought one An adequate ethics of data for today would include not only regulatory policy and statutory law governing matters like personal data privacy and implicit bias in algorithms  It would also establish cultural expectations  fortified by extensive education in high schools and colleges  requiring us to think about data technologies as we build them  not after they have already profiled  categorized and otherwise informationalized millions of people  Students who will later turn their talents to the great challenges of data science would also be trained to consider the ethical design and use of the technologies they will someday unleash Clearly  we are not there  High schoolers today may aspire to be the next Mark Zuckerberg  but how many dream of designing ethical data technologies  Who would their role models even be  Executives at Facebook  Twitter and Amazon are among our celebrities today  But how many data ethics advocates can the typical social media user name Our approach to the ethics of data is wholly reactive  Investigations are conducted and apologies are extracted only after damage has been done  and only in some instances   Mr  Zuckerberg seemed to take a positive step on Wednesday  when he vowed to take action to better protect Facebook s user data   We also made mistakes  there s more to do  and we need to step up and do it   he said in  unsurprisingly  a Facebook post This is like lashing a rope around the cracking foundation of a building  What we need is for an ethics of data to be engineered right into the information skyscrapers being built today  We need data ethics by design  Any good building must comply with a complex array of codes  standards and detailed studies of patterns of use by its eventual inhabitants  But technical systems are today being built with a minimal concern for compliance and a total disregard for the downstream consequences of decades of identifiable data being collected on the babies being born into the most complicated information ecology that has ever existed Mr  Zuckerberg and other Silicon Valley chiefs admitted in the wake of the election that their platforms needed fixing to help mitigate the bad actors who had exploited social media for political gain  It is not Mr  Zuckerberg s fault that our society has given him a free pass  and a net worth of  67 billion  for inventing his platform first and asking only later what its social consequences might be  It is all of our faults  Thus  however successful Mr  Zuckerberg will be in making amends  he will assuredly do almost nothing to prevent the next wunderkind from coming along and building the next killer app that will unleash who knows what before anybody even has a chance to notice The challenge of designing ethics into data technologies is formidable  This is in part because it requires overcoming a century long ethos of data science  Develop first  question later  Datafication first  regulation afterward  A glimpse at the history of data science shows as much The techniques that Cambridge Analytica uses to produce its psychometric profiles are the cutting edge of data driven methodologies first devised 100 years ago  The science of personality research was born in 1917  That year  in the midst of America s fevered entry into war  Robert Sessions Woodworth of Columbia University created the Personal Data Sheet  a questionnaire that promised to assess the personalities of Army recruits  The war ended before Woodworth s psychological instrument was ready for deployment  but the Army had envisioned its use according to the precedent set by the intelligence tests it had been administering to new recruits under the direction of Robert Yerkes  a professor of psychology at Harvard at the time  The data these tests could produce would help decide who should go to the fronts  who was fit to lead and who should stay well behind the lines The stakes of those wartime decisions were particularly stark  but the aftermath of those psychometric instruments is even more unsettling  As the century progressed  such tests   I Q  tests  college placement exams  predictive behavioral assessments   would affect the lives of millions of Americans  Schoolchildren who may have once or twice acted out in such a way as to prompt a psychometric evaluation could find themselves labeled  setting them on an inescapable track through the education system Researchers like Woodworth and Yerkes  or their Stanford colleague Lewis Terman  who formalized the first SAT  did not anticipate the deep consequences of their work  they were too busy pursuing the great intellectual challenges of their day  much like Mr  Zuckerberg in his pursuit of the next great social media platform  Or like Cambridge Analytica s Christopher Wylie  the twentysomething data scientist who helped build psychometric profiles of two thirds of all Americans by leveraging personal information gained through uninformed consent  All of these researchers were  quite understandably  obsessed with the great data science challenges of their generation  Their failure to consider the consequences of their pursuits  however  is not so much their fault as it is our collective failing For the past 100 years we have been chasing visions of data with a singular passion  Many of the best minds of each new generation have devoted themselves to delivering on the inspired data science promises of their day  intelligence testing  building the computer  cracking the genetic code  creating the internet  and now this  We have in the course of a single century built an entire society  economy and culture that runs on information  Yet we have hardly begun to engineer data ethics appropriate for our extraordinary information carnival  If we do not do so soon  data will drive democracy  and we may well lose our chance to do anything about it Colin Koopman is an associate professor of

                        As Facebook grapples with a backlash over its role in spreading disinformation  an internal dispute over how to handle the threat and the public outcry is resulting in the departure of a senior executive The impending exit of that executive   Alex Stamos  Facebook s chief information security officer   reflects heightened leadership tension at the top of the social network  Much of the internal disagreement is rooted in how much Facebook should publicly share about how nation states misused the platform and debate over organizational changes in the run up to the 2018 midterm elections  according to current and former employees briefed on the matter Mr  Stamos  who plans to leave Facebook by August  had advocated more disclosure around Russian interference of the platform and some restructuring to better address the issues  but was met with resistance by colleagues  said the current and former employees  In December  Mr  Stamos s day to day responsibilities were reassigned to others  they said Mr  Stamos said he would leave Facebook but was persuaded to stay through August to oversee the transition of his responsibilities and because executives thought his departure would look bad  the people said  He has been overseeing the transfer of his security team to Facebook s product and infrastructure divisions  His group  which once had 120 people  now has three  the current and former employees said           Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Mr  Stamos would be the first high ranking employee to leave Facebook since controversy over disinformation on its site  Company leaders   including Mark Zuckerberg  Facebook s chief executive  and Sheryl Sandberg  the chief operating officer   have struggled to address a growing set of problems  including Russian interference on the platform  the rise of false news and the disclosure over the weekend that 50 million of its user profiles had been harvested by Cambridge

on the matter  who asked not to be identified because the proceedings were confidential  Some of the company s executives are weighing their own legacies and reputations as Facebook s image has taken a beating  Several believe the company would have been better off saying little about Russian interference and note that other companies  such as Twitter  which have stayed relatively quiet on the issue  have not had to deal with as much criticism One central tension at Facebook has been that of the legal and policy teams versus the security team  The security team generally pushed for more disclosure about how nation states had misused the site  but the legal and policy teams have prioritized business imperatives  said the people briefed on the matter  The people whose job is to protect the user always are fighting an uphill battle against the people whose job is to make money for the company   said Sandy Parakilas  who worked at Facebook enforcing privacy and other rules until 2012 and now advises a nonprofit organization called the Center for Humane Technology  which is looking at the effect of technology on people Mr  Stamos said in statement on Monday   These are really challenging issues  and I ve had some disagreements with all of my colleagues  including other executives   On Twitter  he said he was  still fully engaged with my work at Facebook  and acknowledged that his role has changed  without addressing his future plans                       Despite the rumors  I m still fully engaged with my work at Facebook  It s true that my role did change  I m currently spending more time exploring emerging security risks and working on election security                    Alex Stamos   alexstamos          March 19  2018          Facebook did not have a comment on the broader issues around Mr  Stamos s departure Mr  Stamos joined Facebook from Yahoo in June 2015  He and other Facebook executives  such as Ms  Sandberg  disagreed early on over how proactive the social network should be in policing its own platform  said the people briefed on the matter  In his statement  Mr  Stamos said his relationship with Ms  Sandberg was  productive  Mr  Stamos first put together a group of engineers to scour Facebook for Russian activity in June 2016  the month the Democratic National Committee announced it had been attacked by Russian hackers  the current and former employees said By November 2016  the team had uncovered evidence that Russian operatives had aggressively pushed DNC leaks and propaganda on Facebook  That same month  Mr  Zuckerberg publicly dismissed the notion that fake news influenced the 2016 election  calling it a  pretty crazy idea            Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  In the ensuing months

Facebook s vice president of communications and policy  recommended not naming Russia without more ironclad evidence  said the current and former employees A detailed memorandum Mr  Stamos wrote in early 2017 describing Russian interference was scrubbed for mentions of Russia and winnowed into a blog post last April that outlined  in hypothetical terms  how Facebook could be manipulated by a foreign adversary  they said  Russia was only referenced in a vague footnote  That footnote acknowledged that Facebook s findings did not contradict a declassified January 2017 report in which the director of national intelligence concluded Russia had sought to undermine United States election  and Hillary Clinton in particular Mr  Stamos said in his statement that  we decided that the responsible thing to do would be to make clear that our findings were consistent with those released by the U S  intelligence community  which clearly connected the activity in their report to Russian state sponsored actors  But Facebook s decision to omit Russia backfired  Weeks later  a Time magazine article revealed that Russia had created fake accounts and purchased fake ads to spread propaganda on the platform  allegations that Facebook initially denied By last September  after Mr  Stamos s investigation had revealed further Russian interference  Facebook was forced to reverse course  That month  the company disclosed that beginning in June 2015  Russians had paid Facebook  100 000 to run roughly 3 000 divisive ads to show the American electorate In response  lawmakers like Senator Mark Warner of Virginia  the top Democrat on the intelligence committee  said that although Facebook s revelation was a good first step   I m disappointed it s taken 10 months of raising this issue before they ve become much more transparent  And the revelation also prompted more attention into how Russians had manipulated the social network  Last October and November  Facebook was grilled in front of lawmakers on Capitol Hill for Russian meddling on its platform  along with executives from Twitter and YouTube           Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  The public reaction caused some at Facebook to recoil at revealing more  said the current and former employees  Since the 2016 election  Facebook has paid unusual attention to the reputations of Mr  Zuckerberg and Ms  Sandberg  conducting polls to track how they are viewed by the public  said Tavis McGinn  who was recruited to the company last April and headed the executive reputation efforts through September 2017 Mr  McGinn  who now heads Honest Data  which has done polling about Facebook s reputation in different countries  said Facebook is  caught in a Catch 22   Facebook cares so much about its image that the executives don t want to come out and tell the whole truth when things go wrong   he said   But if they don t  it damages their image  Mr  McGinn said he left Facebook after becoming disillusioned with the company s conduct By December 2017  Mr  Stamos  who reports to Facebook s general counsel  proposed that he report directly to higher ups  Facebook executives rejected that proposal and instead reassigned Mr  Stamos s team  splitting the security team between its product team  overseen by Guy Rosen  and infrastructure team  overseen by Pedro Canahuati  according to current and former employees Apart from managing a small team of engineers in San Francisco  Mr  Stamos has largely been left as Facebook s security communicator  Last month  he appeared as Facebook s representative at the Munich Security Conference Over the weekend  after news broke that Cambridge Analytica had harvested data on as many as 50 million Facebook users  Facebook s communications team encouraged Mr  Stamos to tweet in defense of the company  but only after it asked to approve Mr  Stamos s tweets  according to two people briefed on the incident   After the tweets set off a furious response  Mr  Stamos deleted them Roger B  McNamee  an early investor in Facebook who said he considered himself a mentor to Mr  Zuckerberg  said the company was failing to face the fundamental problems posed by the Russian meddling and other manipulation of content  I told them   Your business is based on trust  and you re losing trust    said Mr  McNamee  a founder of the Center for Humane Technology   They were treating it as a P R  problem  when it s a business problem  I couldn t believe these guys I once knew so well had gotten so far off track    Cambridge Analytica executives were caught on video

weeks when crazy things happen at work  your entire schedule goes haywire and the concept of a good night s sleep starts to resemble a hazy and futile dream  like full employment or healthy pizza Well  folks  this was one of those weeks  On Friday night  when Facebook published a blog post saying that it had suspended Cambridge Analytica for misappropriating user data   a post that was intended to pre empt articles by The New York Times and The Observer of London about that very subject  which were published the next day   it became clear that this was a new kind of Facebook privacy scandal  It has already led to congressional inquiries and user revolts  thrusting the company into the kind of chaos it had not seen in its 14 year history On Wednesday  after a five day silence and lots of speculation about his whereabouts  Mark Zuckerberg  Facebook s chief executive  finally re emerged with a Facebook post and an interview with my colleague Sheera Frenkel and me  among others  You can read the transcript of our interview here  and read our article about Facebook s horrible week here           Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  We had only about 30 minutes on the phone with Mr  Zuckerberg  but we managed to get him to address several important topics  the Cambridge Analytica mess  Facebook s lax data policies  its plans to clamp down on third party developer access and notify users whose data was misused  election interference  including previously unreported Macedonian attempts to interfere in last year s Alabama special election  and Facebook s broader responsibility as a global power         Continue reading the main story                                Advertisement  Continue reading the main story                      But Mr  Zuckerberg s responses also raised more questions Here  for example  is how he answered a question about Facebook s business model  which is based on selling advertisers and developers the ability to target Facebook users based on their personal data Roose  Is the basic economic model of Facebook  in which users provide data that Facebook uses to help advertisers and developers to better target potential customers and users   do you feel like that works  given what we now know about the risks  Zuckerberg  Yeah  so this is a really important question  The thing about the ad model that is really important that aligns with our mission is that   our mission is to build a community for everyone in the world and to bring the world closer together  And a really important part of that is making a service that people can afford  A lot of the people  once you get past the first billion people  can t afford to pay a lot  Therefore  having it be free and have a business model that is ad supported ends up being really important and aligned  Now  over time  might there be ways for people who can afford it to pay a different way  That s certainly something we ve thought about over time  But I don t think the ad model is going to go away  because I think fundamentally  it s important to have a service like this that everyone in the world can use  and the only way to do that is to have it be very cheap or free Narrowly  it may be true that being free and ad supported helps Facebook achieve its goals of connecting billions of people to its services  Facebook has developed a number of ways to make itself cheaper and easier to access   including  in some countries  effectively subsidizing use through its Free Basics program  which allows people to use Facebook without its counting toward their data plans      Newsletter Sign Up     Continue reading the main story         Interested in All Things Tech     The Bits newsletter will keep you updated on the latest from Silicon Valley and

United Nations investigators for fueling ethnic violence against the Rohingya  it s possible that having a slightly higher barrier to entry would be a net good  even if it cost Facebook some users in the short term   And it s not even clear that it would  People already pay for their cellphones and data plans all over the world  and might be willing to part with a small fee to keep using their favorite social network  Switching to a subscription model wouldn t fix all of Facebook s problems overnight  There would still be foreign actors trying to interfere in elections  false news and divisive content intending to sway public opinion  and innumerable other issues  But moving away from an ad supported model would make the network harder to exploit   Bot networks are less effective on subscription platforms  for example   And it would lessen the company s incentive to sell out its users  privacy to advertisers Facebook has already shown a willingness to try new models  WhatsApp  for example  makes money by charging businesses for an enterprise product that lets them message their customers  And this week  in an announcement immediately buried by an avalanche of other news about the company  Facebook said it was experimenting with a subscription model that would allow popular creators to charge  5 per month for access to their posts What if all of Facebook cost  5 per month to use  and certain types of divisive and exploitable ad categories and behaviors were removed from the network entirely  Would users revolt en masse  and decide to colonize some other free social media app  Would Facebook collapse without a pipeline of advertising dollars Maybe  But being smaller might not be a bad thing  If we ve learned anything from this year s troubles  it s this  Facebook s platform problems multiply as it gets bigger and more complex  but its ability to deal with those problems stays fairly constant  Zuckerberg might be dedicated to fixing Facebook s problems  but unless he addresses its biggest problem of all   its enormous scale  paired with a business model that requires the company to monetize its users  private data to the greatest extent possible

                        WASHINGTON   Facebook on Sunday faced a backlash about how it protects user data  as American and British lawmakers demanded that it explain how a political data firm with links to President Trump s 2016 campaign was able to harvest private information from more than 50 million Facebook profiles without the social network s alerting users Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota  a Democratic member of the Senate Judiciary Committee  went so far as to press for Mark Zuckerberg  Facebook s chief executive  to appear before the panel to explain what the social network knew about the misuse of its data  to target political advertising and manipulate voters  The calls for greater scrutiny followed reports on Saturday in The New York Times and The Observer of London that Cambridge Analytica  a political data firm founded by Stephen K  Bannon and Robert Mercer  the wealthy Republican donor  had used the Facebook data to develop methods that it claimed could identify the personalities of individual American voters and influence their behavior  The firm s so called psychographic modeling underpinned its work for the Trump campaign in 2016  though many have questioned the effectiveness of its techniques But Facebook did not inform users whose data had been harvested  The lack of disclosure could violate laws in Britain and in many American states           Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Damian Collins  a Conservative lawmaker in Britain who is leading a parliamentary inquiry into fake news and Russian meddling in the country s referendum to leave the European Union  said this weekend that he  too  would call on Mr  Zuckerberg or another top executive to testify  The social network sent executives who handle policy matters to answer questions at an earlier hearing in February         Continue reading the main story                                Advertisement  Continue reading the main story                       It is not acceptable that they have previously sent witnesses who seek to avoid answering difficult questions by claiming not to know the answers   Mr  Collins said in a statement   This also creates a false reassurance that Facebook s stated policies are always robust and effectively policed  The fallout from the reports added to questions Facebook was already confronting over the use of its platform by those seeking to spread Russian propaganda and fake news  The social media giant has grappled with the criticism over the issue for much of the past year  and struggled to keep public opinion on its side Over the weekend  Facebook was on the defensive  Top executives took to Twitter to argue that the company s protections had not been breached  and that Facebook was thus not at fault  This was unequivocally not a data breach   tweeted Andrew Bosworth  a Facebook executive   No systems were infiltrated  no passwords or information were stolen or hacked  The data was obtained in 2014  when Cambridge Analytica  through an outside researcher  paid users small sums to take a personality quiz and download an app  which would scrape some private information from their profiles and from those of their friends   activity that Facebook permitted at the time  The approach was based on a technique pioneered at Cambridge University by data scientists who claimed it could reveal more about a person than even their parents or romantic partners knew The researcher hired by Cambridge Analytica  Alexandr Kogan  told Facebook and his app s users that he was collecting information for academic purposes  not for a political data firm owned by a wealthy conservative  Facebook did nothing to verify how the information was being used Mr  Bosworth argued on Twitter that a violation had been committed only by Cambridge Analytica and Mr  Kogan  whose app  did not follow the data agreements            Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Facebook s chief security officer  Alex Stamos  issued a similar defense in a series of tweets that have since been deleted  The recent Cambridge Analytica stories by the NY Times and The Guardian are important and powerful  but it is incorrect to call this a  breach  under any reasonable definition of the term   Mr  Stamos tweeted The explanation did little  however  to stem the tide of anger as independent researchers pointed out that many others could have similarly misused Facebook data  Facebook s platform must protect us from predatory behavior   wrote a Twitter user named Evan Baily   or we can t and shouldn t trust the platform  Photo                           Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota pressed for Mark Zuckerberg  Facebook s chief executive  to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee                                       Credit             Noah Berger Associated Press                     Jonathan Albright  research director at the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University  wrote that the lack oversight and transparency into what sort of data Facebook collected on its users meant that the company s platform could continue to be exploited  Unethical people will always do bad things when we make it easy for them and there are few   if any   lasting repercussions   Mr  Albright said Paul Grewal  a vice president and deputy general counsel at Facebook  said in a statement that the company was looking into whether the data in question still existed   That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people s information   he said

hundreds of gigabytes of unencrypted data files on Cambridge servers There were also questions from technology experts and others about Facebook s reaction to the news reports by The Times and The

alarm at the data leak  The company promised to take action and announced that it was suspending the accounts of Cambridge Analytica  Mr  Kogan and Mr  Wylie By then  Facebook had learned that Mr  Wylie  who left Cambridge Analytica in 2014  was a named source for the news reports In a statement on Sunday  Mr  Wylie described himself as  a curious and naïve 23 year old   when he first went to work for Cambridge Analytica  I feel a sense of regret every day when I see where they have helped take our world   he added   I need to make amends  and that s why I m coming forward

18  2018          His lawyer  Tamsin Allen  said that last week Mr  Wylie offered to help Facebook recover the missing data Now  though  Facebook said on Sunday  Mr  Wylie is refusing to cooperate with the company until the suspension is lifted   a move the social network is not willing to make because of his role in the data harvesting In both Britain and the United States  lawmakers said that in the light of the new reports  they wanted fresh answers from both Facebook and Cambridge Analytica about how the data was obtained and what was done with it           Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Mr  Collins  the British lawmaker  said he planned to call Alexander Nix  the chief executive of Cambridge Analytica  to return to Parliament and answer questions about testimony last month in which he claimed that the company never obtained or used Facebook data  It seems clear that he has deliberately misled the committee and Parliament   Mr  Collins said In the United States  the attorney general of Massachusetts  Maura Healey  announced on Saturday that her office was opening an investigation   Massachusetts residents deserve answers immediately from Facebook and Cambridge Analytica   she said in a Twitter post that linked to the Times article   Also on Saturday  the two top Congressional Democrats leading inquiries into Russian interference in the 2016 election   Senator Mark Warner of Virginia and Representative Adam Schiff of California   called for investigations of the Facebook data leak  This raises serious questions about the level of

announced that Facebook was throwing open its doors No longer  he said  would Facebook be a closed off software product like every other social network  Instead  it would become an open platform and invite outside developers to build apps and programs on top of it  We want to make Facebook into something of an operating system   Mr  Zuckerberg told a reporter At the time  the announcement drew little notice outside the programming world  Developers quickly went to work making fun and quirky apps that plugged into Facebook   early hits included  Rendezbook   a kind of proto Tinder that allowed users to match with each other for  random flings   and CampusRank  which allowed college students to nominate their peers for yearbook type awards           Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Later  popular games like FarmVille arrived  and apps like Tinder and Spotify began allowing their users to log in using their Facebook credentials  In some ways  it was a fair trade  Facebook got to weave itself more deeply into users  internet habits  and the outside app developers got access to a big audience and valuable data about their users  In all  millions of apps have been created with Facebook s open platform tools         Continue reading the main story                                Advertisement  Continue reading the main story                      Through it all  Facebook s users were mostly unfazed  Sure  these apps collected data about their lives  But they seemed convenient and harmless  and  really  what could go wrong Today  more than a decade later  the consequences of Facebook s laissez faire approach are becoming clear  Over the weekend  The New York Times reported that Cambridge Analytica  a British consulting firm  improperly acquired the private data of about roughly 50 million Facebook users  and used it to target voters on behalf of the Trump campaign during the 2016 presidential election What happened with Cambridge Analytica wasn t technically a data breach  since this trove of personal information wasn t stolen from Facebook s servers  Rather  it was given away freely to the maker of a Facebook personality quiz app called  thisisyourdigitallife  That app  which was developed by a University of Cambridge professor  collected data about the 270 000 people who installed it  along with data about their Facebook friends  totaling 50 million people in all  The professor  Aleksandr Kogan  then gave the data he had harvested to Cambridge Analytica Technically  only this last step violated Facebook s rules  which prohibit selling or giving away data collected by a third party app  The rest was business as usual  Third party apps collect vast amounts of detailed personal information about Facebook users every day  including their ages  location  pages they ve liked and groups they belong to  Users can opt out of sharing specific pieces of information  but it s unclear how many do      Newsletter Sign Up

us anytime       This kind of broad data collection is not only allowed but encouraged by Facebook  which wants to keep developers happily building on top of its platform  Permissiveness is a feature  as they say  not a bug But in the wake of incidents like the data leak to Cambridge Analytica  some are questioning the costs of such loose policies on an influential platform with 2 2 billion registered users           Advertisement  Continue reading the main story   It seems insane that you can make haphazard decisions about so many people s data   said Can Duruk  a technology consultant and software engineer  Facebook  he said  was  extremely lax with what kind of data they allowed people to get  In a Facebook post on Monday  Andrew Bosworth  a Facebook vice president  admitted that that thinking may have been a mistake  We thought that every app could be social   Mr  Bosworth wrote   Your calendar should have your events and your friends birthdays  your maps should know where your friends live  your address book should show their pictures  It was a reasonable vision but it didn t materialize the way we had hoped  An early clue about the potential for misuse of Facebook s third party developer tools came in 2010 when my colleague Emily Steel  then at The Wall Street Journal  reported that an online tracking company  RapLeaf  was collecting and reselling data it had gathered from third party Facebook apps to marketing firms and political consultants  In response  Facebook cut off RapLeaf s data access and said it would  dramatically limit  the misuse of its users  personal information by outside parties But preventing data hungry developers from exploiting Facebook s treasure trove of personal information remained challenging  In 2015  Facebook removed the ability of third party developers to collect detailed information about the friends of users who had installed an app  citing privacy concerns   Cambridge Analytica s data trove  which included this type of information  was gathered in 2014  before the change   Facebook has also taken away tools used by developers to create games and quizzes that barraged users with annoying notifications But the core functions of Facebook s open platform tool are still intact  There are still many third party apps like  thisisyourdigitallife  out there  vacuuming up intimate data about Facebook users  That data doesn t disappear  and Facebook has no real recourse to stop it from falling into the wrong hands Not all open data access is used irresponsibly  Researchers and nongovernmental organizations have used Facebook s third party development tools to respond to natural disasters  And many of the functions that internet users depend on   for example  the ability to import their digital address books into a new messaging app   are possible thanks only to the tools that allow for third party development known as application programming interfaces  or A P I s  Everything we depend on uses A P I s   said Kin Lane  a software engineer who maintains a website called API Evangelist   They re in your home  in your business  in your car  It s how these platforms innovate and do cool  interesting things  In Facebook s case  permissive data policies were also good for business  Third party developers built millions of apps on top of Facebook s platform  giving Facebook users more reasons to spend time on the site and generating more ad revenue for the company  Restricting access to data would limit Facebook s usefulness to developers and could drive them to build on a rival platform instead  making those products better           Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  In this context  it s even less surprising that Dr  Kogan and Cambridge Analytica were able to use a silly personality quiz to collect information about millions of Americans  After all  why else would the quiz be there                  Email Kevin Roose at kevin roose nytimes com  or follow him on

investors  but after a freakout  their optimism returns and the stock market moves higher But will investors shrug off President Trump s tariffs on China The stock market plunged Thursday after Mr  Trump announced the measures against China  Since mid February  when the Trump administration laid out its case for steel and aluminum tariffs  the S  P  500 is down 3 2 percent  The Dow Jones industrial average is off nearly 5 percent           Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Until now  investors might have thought they could take Mr  Trump s trade pronouncements in stride  After all  many countries have won a reprieve from the steel and aluminum tariffs  And as Edward Alden of the Council on Foreign Relations wrote Thursday of the anti China measures   The administration is delaying the action to solicit comments from affected U S  companies  and it is quite possible the final tariffs will fall short of the threats          Continue reading the main

tariffs  it may soften its stance if China suggests that its open to negotiations  The world could relax But China may not budge  As our colleague Steven Lee Myers reports  President Xi Jinping has so far managed to navigate Mr  Trump s rhetoric while maintaining a strong nationalist image at home  Yet Mr  Trump s tariff announcement  along with moves perceived by the Chinese as humiliating  may prompt China to retaliate with force Investors would then scramble to quantify the economic repercussions  They might not be terrible Some American companies  like computer chip makers  get substantial revenue from China  But on average  companies in the S  P  500 index derive a small share of their sales from the country And some investors may take a long view  believing that U S  companies have long been treated unfairly in China  A trade fight that eventually relaxes some of those disadvantageous conditions could bolster the long term prospects of those firms  And if the U S  is able to recruit other countries to its cause  China may relent Still  much could go wrong  A true test of investor sentiment will come if China fights back  Markets could fall further  creating a financial chain reaction that dampens the wider economy  A lot would depend on how Mr  Trump responds to Chinese actions  Would he up the ante  It s genuinely hard to predict how this will turn out   said Scott Kennedy  an expert in Chinese trade at the Center for Strategic and International Studies   whether one side will back down or whether it will spiral into a trade war    Peter EavisPhoto

worth of annual tariffs on Chinese imports as the White House moved to punish China for what it says is a pattern of co opting American technology and trade secrets and robbing companies of jobs and billions of dollars in revenue The tariffs will target 1 300 lines of Chinese goods   everything from shoes and clothing to electronics   the NYT reports administration officials said Mr  Trump  the officials added  will also direct the Treasury Department to impose restrictions on Chinese investment in American technology companies  a practice that they said the Chinese government uses to develop its own  national champions  in cutting edge industries like A I  and autonomous vehicles  The end objective of this is to get China to modify its unfair trade practices   Everett Eissenstat  the deputy director of the National Economic Council  told reporters Peter Navarro  the director of the White House National Trade Council and an architect of the measures  cast the tariffs as part of a seminal shift in how the U S  views China  Rather than trying to draw it into the rules based international economic order   a policy that dates back to Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger   the U S  now regards China as a strategic competitor  bent on eroding American security and prosperity   Mark Landler and Jim TankersleyPhoto                                        Credit             Brendan

biggest aviation market by 2022  Ms  Sutherland and Mr  Fickling write China could target Boeing if the country decides to retaliate against the U S Boeing is down 3 6 percent today  shaving more than

said Mr  Nix  head of a data consulting firm that advised the Trump campaign on targeting voters  As far as I m aware  we ve never worked for a Russian company   Mr  Nix added   We ve never worked with a Russian organization in Russia or any other country  and we don t have any relationship with Russia or Russian individuals  But Mr  Nix s business did have some dealings with Russian interests  according to company documents and interviews           Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Mr  Nix is a director of SCL Group  a British political and defense contractor  and chief executive of its American offshoot  Cambridge Analytica  which advised the Trump campaign  The firms  employees  who often overlap  had contact in 2014 and 2015 with executives from Lukoil  the Russian oil giant         Continue reading the main story                                Advertisement  Continue reading the main story                      Lukoil was interested in how data was used to target American voters  according to two former company insiders who said there were at least three meetings with Lukoil executives in London and Turkey  SCL and Lukoil denied that the talks were political in nature  and SCL also said there were no meetings in London The contacts took place as Cambridge Analytica was building a roster of Republican clients in the United States   and harvesting the Facebook profiles of over 50 million users to develop tools to analyze voters  behavior Cambridge Analytica also included extensive questions about Russia s president  Vladimir V  Putin  in surveys it was carrying out in American focus groups in 2014  It is not clear what   or which client   prompted the line of questioning  which asked for views on topics ranging from Mr  Putin s popularity to Russian expansionism On two promotional documents obtained by The New York Times  SCL said it did business in Russia  In both documents  the country is highlighted on world maps that specify the location of SCL clients  with one of the maps noting that the clients were for the firm s elections division  In a statement  SCL said an employee had done  commercial work  about 25 years ago  for a private company in Russia  Photo                           President Vladimir V  Putin of Russia  left  meeting with Vagit Alekperov  He is the head of Lukoil  an oil giant that was in talks with Cambridge Analytica employees                                       Credit             Mikhail Klimentyev RIA Novosti Kremlin  via Reuters                     Cambridge Analytica has been a political flash point since its role in the Trump campaign attracted scrutiny after the election  While Mr  Nix s firm turned over some records to the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence during its investigation of Russian interference  Democrats on the committee want a fuller review   It is imperative to interview a broader range of individuals employed by or linked to Cambridge Analytica   they said in a report this month Asked about the Russian oil company  a spokesman for SCL said that in 2014 the firm s commercial division  discussed helping Lukoil Turkey better engage with its loyalty card customers at gas stations   The spokesman said SCL was not ultimately hired Arash Repac  chief executive of Lukoil Eurasia Petrol  offered a different explanation for the talks  He said that a meeting he attended with SCL in Turkey involved a promotional campaign with local soccer teams      Newsletter Sign Up     Continue reading the main story            headline   Morning

the customer data that we were collecting   he wrote in response to a question from The Times   Even though our campaign went ahead  we decided not to cooperate with SCL  No contracts were signed            Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  But Christopher Wylie  who helped found Cambridge Analytica and develop the company s voter profiling technology  said Lukoil showed interest in how the company used data to tailor messaging to American voters  I remember being super confused   said Mr  Wylie  who took part in one of the Lukoil meetings  I kept asking Alexander   Can you explain to me what they want    he said  referring to Mr  Nix   I don t understand why Lukoil wants to know about political targeting in America   We re sending them stuff about political targeting   they then come and ask more about political targeting   Mr  Wylie said  adding that Lukoil  just didn t seem to be interested  in how the techniques could be used commercially Mr  Wylie  a former contractor  left SCL before the talks concluded and could not say what became of the relationship with the oil company  He had a falling out with SCL and tried to set up a rival business  SCL said he had violated a nondisclosure agreement and that his comments were an attempt to hurt the company A second person familiar with the discussions backed up Mr  Wylie s account  but spoke on the condition of anonymity because of a confidentiality agreement Though Lukoil is not state owned  it depends on Kremlin support  and its chief executive  Vagit Alekperov  has met with Mr  Putin on a number of occasions  Reuters reported last year that Lukoil and other companies received instructions from the state energy ministry on providing news stories favorable to Russian leadership

now sold in a few grocery stores in New York City  has collected money from the likes of Google s venture arm and General Catalyst Sensei is focused more on wellness  While the company ultimately plans to expand into an array of businesses  its initial focus is on hydroponic farming  using software and sensors to monitor growing conditions   Its first farm is on Lanai  the Hawaiian island of which Mr  Ellison owns roughly 98 percent  Sensei s first batch of crops includes Black Trifele tomatoes and Komatsuna mustard greens  with its yardstick for production being nutrition per acre  So far  the conversation in agriculture has been dominated by productivity  How much food can we grow in a square foot  But scale is just part of the equation   Dr  Agus said in a statement   To properly nourish the world  we need to consider how nutritious that food is  This is where Sensei is focused  Its first customer is Hawaii  which imports the majority of its food  Sensei said that it can provide the state fresh food within 24 hours of harvesting  compared with over a week for imported vegetables But the company is also eager to tout its tech bona fides  Its farm runs off solar power provided by Tesla panels  And it claims to use just 10 percent of the water used in traditional farming methods  For so long  agriculture has been one of the least digitized industries   Daniel Gruneberg  Sensei s president  said in a statement   Now  we can combine software  sensors and robotics to make giant leaps in sustainable farming and perhaps  more importantly  the quality of our

day in about four years Shares of the social media giant finished down about 7 percent after the NYT reported that a political data firm with ties to 2016 Trump campaign harvested private information from over 50 million user profiles The news reports raised the specter of greater government scrutiny and potential regulatory action toward the technology sector  Already  government officials in the United States  Europe and elsewhere have been demanding tougher oversight of the world s largest tech companies  That  in turn  could erode the industry s profits and potentially force some companies to adjust their business models Facebook s stock is now down more than 12 percent from its all time high hit at the start of February  We think this episode is another indication of systemic problems

Mark Zuckerberg  appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee  and a British lawmaker has called for him to testify in an inquiry into the  Brexit  referendum                                       Credit             Jim Wilson The New York Times                     The latest test to Zuckerberg s leadership Is Mark Zuckerberg s unusually powerful position at Facebook in part to blame for the latest backlash against the company The giant social media company is under the spotlight because a political data firm apparently misused information about more than 50 million Facebook users  Facebook is still facing questions about Russia linked accounts that had significant reach within the United States through the social network  In both cases  Facebook has struggled to show the public that it can get in front of its problems  Information about the Russia linked accounts came out piecemeal  and Facebook knew as early as 2015 that the political data firm had violated its data policies Mr  Zuckerberg at first downplayed concerns about Facebook s role in the 2016 presidential election  something he later said he regretted   His recent communications contain more high minded deliberation than hard discussion of the company s problems and how to deal with them These look like the reactions of a leader who thinks he is not going anywhere  Indeed  through his holding of special voting shares  Mr  Zuckerberg has an especially powerful position at Facebook that might shield him from the normal forces of accountability  C E O s without that protection might do more to tackle a big problem because it more directly threatens their job security Facebook  of course  has taken steps to address the abuse of its network  It has added hundreds of new employees to help police posts  and it has implemented artificial intelligence technology to spot material that falls afoul of the company s guidelines  Such initiatives cost money  Mr  Zuckerberg earlier this year said that such initiatives would have a significant impact on Facebook s profitability  Indeed  there s a strong argument to make that Mr  Zuckerberg s protected position will allow the company to press ahead with expensive investments in the face of any shareholder grumbling that may arise In the near term  though  it s hard to envision shareholders applying significant pressure on Facebook to be more responsive to the political and legal risks  They may believe Facebook s extraordinary profitability   its operating profits are roughly equivalent to 40 percent of its revenue   will help the stock ride what they see as a passing storm           Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  If governments propose restrictions on using members  data  Facebook s business model would be tested  The company s board  in theory  should press Mr  Zuckerberg for details on how he will deal with such shackles  But prominent board members like Marc L  Andreessen and Peter A  Thiel are skeptical of regulation  Facebook might be tempted to fight back Lawmakers may hold the line  however  sensing that the public has real concerns about the company  And if Facebook s responses look tardy and inadequate  the consequences could be harsh  as the fate of Wells Fargo  shows  Mr  Zuckerberg  in his uniquely dominant position  is the one person who can make sure this doesn t happen   Peter EavisLawmakers want answers on Facebook s latest controversyLawmakers in the U S  and Britain want Mark Zuckerberg to explain how Cambridge Analytica  the political data firm founded by Steve Bannon and Robert Mercer  harvested private information from over 50 million user profiles  It s clear these platforms can t police themselves   tweeted Senator Amy Klobuchar  a Democratic member of the Senate Judiciary Committee What happened  The NYT and The Observer of London reported how Cambridge had collected data from an outside researcher to better target Facebook users  Christopher Wylie  who oversaw Cambridge s data collection until 2014  told the NYT of his former company   For them  this is a war  and it s all fair  Facebook argued that the incident wasn t a data breach and that Cambridge had committed a violation  But former Federal Trade Commission officials told the WaPo that Facebook may have violated a privacy pact reached with the regulator   The tech giant is reviewing whether one of its employees had been aware of the data leak  More on Cambridge Analytica  Alexander Nix  the company s chief  is facing scrutiny over business dealings with Russian interests  Mr  Wylie said that one Russian company  the oil giant Lukoil  appeared more interested in political message targeting than commercial uses  And Cambridge is reportedly trying to block the airing of a report by Channel 4  a British television channel  in which reporters went undercover at the firm Critic s cornerJeffrey Goldfarb of Breakingviews writes  Facebook has abjectly failed to grasp the magnitude of its problems  It took Zuckerberg almost a year to apologize for his blithe 2016 comment that fake news posted across his website didn t influence the U S  election  In the meantime  there are mounting concerns over its online advertising power  handling of privacy matters and how much tax it pays in Europe  Ten years ago  Zuckerberg hired Sheryl Sandberg to help turn his startup into a

suspended testing of its self driving cars in Tempe  Pittsburgh  San Francisco and Toronto  Our hearts go out to the victim s family  We are fully cooperating with local authorities in their investigation of this incident   an Uber spokeswoman  Sarah Abboud  said in a statement The fatal crash will most likely raise questions about regulations for self driving cars  Testing of self

review of the rule changes at IEX   advances the LTSE s aim of enshrining what it believes are best practices in running companies into corporate charters If the S E C approves the rules  it means that companies can go public using the LTSE principles  but also have their stocks trade on traditional exchanges like the N Y S E  and the Nasdaq like any other listing  That means these companies

shareholders   he told me   That frees up management to do what s right    It comes as companies continue to bemoan short term thinking in the stock markets that has C E O s focused more on meeting a quarter s targets than longer term goals   LTSE s goal is to eventually become a stock exchange on which companies list their shares  But for now  it wants to be allowed to create a special kind of listing for IEX that lets companies go public under its principles   LTSE also plans to promote itself as serving companies first and foremost and to make money more from listing fees and tools and services for its companies  rather than from trading offerings and data aimed at investors The caveatIt s a long road ahead  Not just for the rule change process  but also in convincing start ups to adopt these rules when they go public  What we have promised our venture investors is not that this is going to instantly transform the market overnight   Mr  Ries said   Michael de la MercedPhoto

"AdvertisementOpinionSupported byEditorialFacebook Leaves Its Users  Privacy VulnerableImageCreditTim PeacockBy The Editorial BoardMarch 19  2018Facebook is once again struggling with revelations that manipulative characters exploited the vulnerabilities of its platform during the 2016 election to put Donald Trump in the White House  The company said last week that it was suspending the accounts of Cambridge Analytica  a company that worked for the Trump campaign  and a professor  Aleksandr Kogan  who is said to have deceptively amassed information from more than 50 million people without their consent  That may sound like decisive action  but it came more than two years after Facebook learned of the problem Starting in 2014  Mr  Kogan got the data  using a quiz app  under the guise of academic research  He handed the information to Cambridge Analytica  which used it to build profiles of voters  personalities  according to reports in The New York Times and The Observer of London on Saturday What is particularly disturbing about this case is that Facebook has not yet identified and alerted users whose profile information was vacuumed up by the app  most of whom had never used it but were friends with somebody else who had  Further  Facebook did not verify that Cambridge Analytica and Mr  Kogan deleted the data after the social media company told them to in 2015  The Times reported that Cambridge still had most or all of the data Facebook s response so far is reminiscent of its slow  defensive reaction to the spread of pro Trump fake news on its platform during the 2016 presidential campaign  Days after the election  Facebook s founder and chief executive  Mark Zuckerberg  said it was a  pretty crazy idea  to suggest that fake news had influenced the outcome  It took months for him to admit that he was wrong to so cavalierly dismiss the importance of hoaxes spread on Facebook  many of them by people working on behalf of the Russian government It is hard to know just how useful the profile information from Facebook was in Cambridge s effort to help elect Mr  Trump  The company has offered contradictory statements about its use of what s called  psychographic data  for the campaign  which included targeting political messages to voters receptive to them  The trove contained enough details about roughly 30 million people  including where they lived  that the company was able to build detailed profiles by linking the data to other sources of information Officials in the United States and the European Union are investigating Cambridge Analytica  and others say they might  including members of Congress and the attorney general of Massachusetts  Maura Healey  In Britain  regulators and lawmakers are looking at whether the company tried to illegally influence the  Brexit  referendum of 2016 More investigations may be on the way  On Monday  Channel 4 News in Britain released hidden camera tapes in which Cambridge executives said that their company used bribes and prostitutes to entrap politicians  The company denies engaging in corruption and extortion  Robert Mercer  the hedge fund billionaire who is a big supporter of Mr  Trump  owns a controlling stake in Cambridge  and Stephen Bannon  the former chief strategist for the president  is a former company board member Lawmakers and regulators also ought to investigate Facebook s response  For starters  they need to take a close look at whether the company is in violation of a 2011 consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission  which had accused it of deceiving users by telling them their information would be kept private and then allowing it to be shared and made public  They also need to force the company to quickly identify and alert the tens of millions of people whose information might have been disclosed to Cambridge In the longer term  Congress clearly needs to strengthen privacy laws to give people more control over private information and prevent businesses and political campaigns from harvesting personal data under false pretenses  President Barack Obama proposed a privacy bill of rights in 2012  but the idea died in Congress after technology and advertising companies claimed it would be an unfair burden Facebook says it takes this case seriously  But it is clear that lawmakers cannot rely on the company to police itself  Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter   NYTOpinion   and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter  A version of this article appears in print on   on Page A26 of the New York edition with the headline  Facebook Cannot Police Itself  Order Reprints   Today s Paper   SubscribeRelated CoverageOpinionMichelle GoldbergTrump s High Tech Dirty TrickstersMarch 19  2018ImageFacebook Faces Growing Pressure Over Data and Privacy InquiriesMarch 20  2018ImageOpinionZeynep TufekciFacebook s Surveillance MachineMarch 19  2018ImageAdvertisement"

against Chinese products and seemed to conclude that he was taking the U S  into a trade war with China  The stock market plunged 6 percent           Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Perhaps eager to stop the rout  the White House on Monday had a less confrontational message  Mr  Trump is applying one of his negotiating tactics  According to this view  the tariff proposal was a jarring move partly aimed at getting China to see that the U S  was serious about wanting to make trade with China fairer From a CNBC interview with Kevin Hassett  the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers  From the beginning  all the way back to last summer when I arrived at the White House  the president has been clear that he wants to set a marker down with some big asks at the beginning  he doesn t want to dribble them out  and then he wants his negotiators to try to fix the trade problems     Hopefully  it all works out with negotiation  Mr  Hassett s comments were in response to a WSJ article reporting that China and the U S  were quietly engaged in trade negotiations Investors seemed somewhat relieved  The stock market was up 1 5 percent on Monday  Of course  if the stakes are small enough  a deal may get done in the coming months that allows both sides to claim victory  But it seems unlikely that China would quickly agree to a far reaching overhaul of the rules that govern foreign investment in the country  a major area of dispute  Our colleagues Raymond Zhong and Paul Mozur showed the depth of the divide there Mr  Trump could up the ante if China shows no real signs that it will open up considerably  That could roil the markets again  The White House may want to signal that it can take market turmoil in stride  Mr  Hassett on Monday seemed to say that the White House expects market sell offs as it pursues its trade agenda  If you start from a world where a bunch your intellectual technology is being stolen  then of course it s going to increase risk premiums in the short run when you try to do something about it  but in the end it should be a positive for us if we can get them to just stop them disregarding the rules of international order   Rising risk premiums means investors require a better return on their stocks and bonds to cover higher risks  This usually involves a decline in price to make their returns look better to prospective buyers  Still  the more conciliatory tone from the White House after the sell off suggests there is not a strong desire for a full on trade war   Peter EavisShares of Facebook continue to slide The stock is down 6 5 percent Monday morning as the Federal Trade Commission confirmed that it has opened an investigation into Facebook s privacy practice           Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Also on Monday  Senator Chuck Grassley  Republican of Iowa and chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee  invited Mr  Zuckerberg to testify about privacy standards next month and also extended the invitation to Google s chief executive  Sundar Pichai  and Twitter s chief executive  Jack Dorsey Facebook s shares are down nearly 22 percent since its high in early February and off more than 18 percent since the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke more than a week ago To put Facebook s recent tumble in perspective  The stock is set for its worst monthly performance since August 2012  Over the past 10 days  Facebook has lost  100 billion in market value Despite the fall  Wall Street has not soured on Facebook  Forty four analysts have buy ratings on the stock  compare to just two who have sell ratings  according to Bloomberg Photo                                        Credit             Jenny Kane Associated Press                     Tim Cook thinks regulation of Facebook is inevitableThe Apple C E O  said at the China Development Forum in Beijing that the government should tighten privacy regulations  after last week s revelations about Facebook and Cambridge Analytica  I think that this certain situation is so dire and has become so large that probably some well crafted regulation is necessary  The ability of anyone to know what you ve been browsing about for years  who your contacts are  who their contacts are  things you like and dislike and every intimate detail of your life   from my own point of view  it shouldn t exist  Apple often uses privacy as a selling point  but Mr  Cook wasn t the only critic  Elon Musk deleted SpaceX and Tesla s Facebook pages  saying that the Tesla one  looks lame anyway   Sir Martin Sorrell of the ad giant WPP said Facebook needed to  step up to the mark  and be responsible for content on its platform  And some companies have stopped buying ads on Facebook  highlighting how advertisers want more transparency about performance   Users also complained that the Android app tracked calls and text messages  Meanwhile  Facebook took out full page ads in several British and American newspapers   including the NYT   for an apology signed by Mark Zuckerberg Elsewhere in Cambridge Analytica news  A volunteer for the campaign for Britain to leave the E U  said that a Canadian data company linked to Cambridge Analytica had played a role in the organization s work  Groups campaigning against Brexit have written to Prime Minister Theresa May demanding an investigation into what members of her cabinet and her staff knew Andrew s takeMr  Cook s points on privacy are absolutely right  But he has a tough needle to thread  given that Apple does business in China and acknowledges that it is  subject to each country s laws  that it does business in  Apple encrypts all user data and says there is no back door   and I believe that   most security and political experts have speculated that Beijing might ultimately be able to gain access iCloud data for Chinese customers  It adopted a law requiring all cloud services to be operated by Chinese companies  Apple says that it lobbied against the new law  but ultimately complied           Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  As for Facebook s ad  take note of this   We expect there are others  And when we find

the defense contractor Context At a conference late last month  Greg Hayes  the chief executive of United Technologies  said the company was thinking of splitting up  Is  United Technologies  a more

USG closing price on Friday In rejecting the offer  USG said the proposal substantially undervalued the building products maker Knauf owns 10 5 percent of USG  making Knauf the second largest shareholder in USG behind Warren Buffett s Berkshire Hathaway with a 31 percent stake Berkshire had proposed an option for Knauf to buy Berkshire s stake in USG  according to the filing  The option would be exercisable only if Knauf bought all of USG s shares outstanding for at least  42  Berkshire proposed an option purchase price of  2 per share From Reuters The option provides a sweetener for Buffett to shed a profitable investment that originated in late 2008  at the height of the housing crisis  when Berkshire and Canada s Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd bought  400 million of USG s debt  The  2 per share cost of the option would provide Berkshire about  86 8 million upfront  based on its 43 39 million share USG stake  Berkshire would keep that money even if Knauf proved unable to buy

tariffs talksAfter a Friday that saw the markets sink amid fears of a trade war  the U S  and China are holding high level talks to defuse tensions  the WSJ reports  Leading them  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin  U S  Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Liu He  Beijing s economic czar Among Washington s requests  in a letter to Mr  Liu  were lower Chinese tariffs on American cars and more freedom for Wall Street firms to expand in China Mr  Mnuchin told  Fox News Sunday  that he believed the recent rate increase by the Federal Reserve was to blame for recent market declines  not tariffs  He added   We re not afraid of a trade war  but that s not our objective  News of the talks have lifted markets in Asia and Europe  while S  P  500 futures jumped this morning  It will also

Reserve policymakers conclude their March rate setting meeting on Wednesday  It is the first such session with Jerome H  Powell as the central bank s new chairman With the job market tight and inflation picking up only gradually  the Fed is widely expected to raise rates by a quarter of a percentage point in what is likely to be the first of three rate increases this year

Fed might depart from its anticipated path  and  if so  why         Continue reading the main story                                Advertisement  Continue reading the main story                      Here s a look at what economists and money managers are expecting Jan Hatzius  Goldman Sachs   Public remarks by Fed officials suggest a broad shift in the committee s outlook towards a potentially faster pace of tightening  and we expect the median dot to show four hikes in 2018  up from three at the December meeting  Additional hawkish changes a move to three hikes in 2019 or an increase in the longer run funds rate estimates are also possible but not our base case  Michelle Meyer  Bank of America Merrill Lynch  Ms  Meyer says she expects the Fed raise rates this meeting  but  unlike December where there were two dissents  we expect this decision to be unanimous given the shift in voters this year in the hawkish direction  The focus will be on the evolution of the dots  we look for the median to hold at three hikes for this year  but to shift up from two to three hikes in 2019  We also think the long run dot will edge up to 2 875   This would show a Fed that is more confident about its ability to deliver rate hikes  but without an urgency to front load the tightening  Ian Shepherdson  Pantheon Macroeconomics  Mr  Powell  is bound to be faced with questions along the lines of  Why are you not raising the dots in the wake of the substantial  unfunded fiscal easing    His reply  we suspect  will be something like   It s not our job to tell Congress how to conduct fiscal policy  and it s too soon to assess the impact of the tax cuts and spending increases  Much of the easing of policy could be saved rather than spent  and there are encouraging signs that productivity is picking up  so any upturn in wage growth as a result of fiscal loosening need not necessarily generate higher inflation  In any event  with inflation well below target  gradual normalization is the best way to balance the risks of both future inflation and the premature ending of the cycle via excessive tightening  Stephen Stanley  Amherst Pierpont   The bulk of the interest in this week s F O M C  meeting will come from the updated dot and economic projections as well as any meaningful tweaks to the key elements of the F O M C  statement  Any changes to the dots and statement language are likely to be in the hawkish direction  though I would expect that the new information will be more evolutionary than a radically different  Steve Rick  CUNA Mutual Group  There is  a very strong case for not only raising rates this week  but potentially doing so in a more aggressive manner than previously forecasted at the end of 2017  I think we could see projections get updated to call for four hikes instead of three  with plans for lifting rates more in coming years as well  Chris Zaccarelli  Independent Advisor Alliance   Whether we have 3 or 4 rate hikes this year shouldn t be that big of a difference to the economy  but it WILL have a big impact on market prices and market psychology  Every statement   whether spoken or written   will be highly scrutinized looking for clues as to whether the Fed Funds rate will be 1  higher  or only 75 bps  a year from now  Photo                           Steven Mnuchin last month in Washington  As the United States

Continue reading the main story  On Monday  Steven Mnuchin  the United States Treasury secretary  was peppered with requests from several countries for exemptions from the tariffs  which are being imposed in the name of national security In an interview on the sidelines of the meeting  Mr  Mnuchin suggested exemptions to the tariffs could be announced  relatively quickly  Mr  Mnuchin said  I think we ve been very transparent in describing our positions  I don t think anything should be a surprise  This is all about free and fair and reciprocal trade  Mr  Trump has already said he would exempt Canada and Mexico from the tariffs upon a successful renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement  and he has indicated that other countries could also get exemptions  But the United States has yet to detail exactly what would qualify a country for an exemption  other than a vague reference to protecting the United States  national security and reducing bilateral trade deficits Countries including France  Argentina and South Korea pressed Mr  Mnuchin on Monday about being freed from the metals tariffs  arguing that  as United States allies  they should not be penalized on national security grounds  Mr  Mnuchin said that decisions were being made on a case by case basis and that there was not a one size fits all approach to deciding which countries would be exempt  The tariffs go into effect on Friday   Alan RappeportPhoto                           Facebook shares dropped nearly 7 percent Monday  and its chief information security officer  Alex Stamos

pressure from lawmakers and regulators to answer questions about the improper harvesting of data of 50 million Facebook users by a British political consulting firm  Cambridge Analytica Now Mr  Zuckerberg plans to go to Washington to explain himself The chief executive has agreed to testify in at least one congressional hearing over the social network s handling of customer data  according to people familiar with the decision  Specifically  he plans to appear next month before the House Energy and Commerce Committee  said the people  who asked not to be identified because the arrangements were not public  Mr  Zuckerberg may make other appearances  he has also been asked to testify before the Senate and House Judiciary and Commerce Committees His appearing on Capitol Hill could create a spectacle that is replayed online and on television for years to come  especially amid a backlash against the power of tech behemoths  Late last year  executives from Facebook  Google and Twitter showed up at congressional hearings to discuss Russian meddling online in the 2016 presidential election  putting faces to the tech platforms during criticism of their misuse Congressional testimony by Silicon Valley chief executives is rare  and their appearances have each set off a media circus  In 2013  Apple s chief executive  Timothy D  Cook  addressed senators about his company s tax practices  In 2011  Google s chairman at the time  Eric Schmidt  spoke about the company s search practices in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee  And in 1998  Bill Gates  who was Microsoft s chief executive  defended his company against lawmakers  assertions that he was building a monopoly   an argument he eventually lost in court           Advertisement  Continue reading the main story

Cambridge Analytica improperly obtained and used the data of 50 million Facebook users  The revelations immediately sparked a furor on both sides of the Atlantic  with regulators in Britain and the United States calling for Mr  Zuckerberg to discuss what happened         Continue reading the main story                                Advertisement  Continue reading the main story                      Those calls haven t subsided  even though the chief executive issued a public statement last week outlining the steps that Facebook was taking to prevent improper  harvesting of the data of its 2 2  billion users  On Monday  the Federal Trade Commission confirmed that it was investigating how Facebook handles information about its users  Politicians including Senator Charles E  Grassley  Republican of Iowa  have also pressed for Mr  Zuckerberg to appear on Capitol Hill Mr  Zuckerberg has turned down some requests to go before lawmakers  He declined to appear this week before the British Parliament and answer questions about data privacy Facebook staff have held marathon meetings and phone calls with staff from congressional committees over the past week  according to Facebook employees and others briefed on the matter  Rob Sherman  Facebook s deputy chief privacy officer  and Molly Cutler  its associate general counsel  have met with staff from the House and Senate Commerce  Judiciary and Intelligence Committees  they said Mr  Zuckerberg initially resisted speaking to Congress  and had asked if a senior Facebook executive could be sent to represent the company in his name  two Facebook employees familiar with the conversations said Video            Cambridge Analytica Whistleblower Testifies in U K                                         Christopher Wylie

 Mr  Zuckerberg was persuaded that he needed to appear  they said  In recent days  he told Facebook employees that he had come to understand he would have to testify In an interview with CNN last week  Mr  Zuckerberg said that he would be  happy to  testify in front of Congress and that  it s the right thing to do   He added of Cambridge Analytica   This was a major breach of trust  and I m really sorry that this happened            Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Google and Twitter have also been called to testify before Congress on data privacy  The companies didn t respond to requests for comment Lawmakers have been frustrated in the past by Mr  Zuckerberg s absence from hearings  Last year  Facebook sent its general counsel  Colin Stretch  to join lawyers from Twitter and Google to testify about social media s role in spreading disinformation during the 2016 election  Lawmakers noted the absence of senior executives  including Mr  Zuckerberg  and repeatedly challenged Facebook to send its leaders to answer questions In a recent interview  Senator John Kennedy  Republican of Louisiana  said Mr  Zuckerberg needed to directly answer questions from Congress about what kind of user data was being gathered and shared  because Facebook has been too vague about its practices  He said the attorneys for Facebook  Google and Twitter who testified about the 2016 election had  dodged questions   They didn t say a damn thing  which was what they were paid to do   Mr  Kennedy said   I d encourage Mr  Zuckerberg to do the common sense thing and roll up his sleeves and

"AdvertisementOpinionSupported byOp Ed ContributorHow to Prevent Smart People From Spreading Dumb IdeasImageCreditScott MenchinBy Michael J  SocolowMarch 22  2018We have a serious problem  and it goes far beyond  fake news   Too many Americans have no idea how to properly read a social media feed  As we re coming to learn more and more  such ignorance seems to be plaguing almost everybody   regardless of educational attainment  economic class  age  race  political affiliation or gender Some very smart people are helping to spread some very dumb ideas We all know this is a problem  The recent federal indictment of a Russian company  the Internet Research Agency  lists the numerous ways Russian trolls and bots created phony events and leveraged social media to sow disruption throughout the 2016 presidential election  New revelations about Cambridge Analytica s sophisticated use of Facebook data to target unsuspecting social media users reminds us how complex the issue has become  Even the pope has weighed in  using his bully pulpit to warn the world of this new global evil ImageCreditScott MenchinBut there are some remarkably easy steps that each of us  on our own  can take to address this issue  By following these three simple guidelines  we can collaborate to help solve a problem that s befuddling the geniuses who built Facebook and Twitter If the problem is crowdsourced  then it seems obvious the solution will have to be crowdsourced as well  With that in mind  here are three easy steps each of us can take to help build a better civic polity  This advice will also help each of us look a little less foolish 1  No link  Not news  Every time somebody tweets  BREAKING  a little bell should go off in your head  Before you even read the rest of the news  look for the link  Average Americans almost never break news about big stories  Even most professional journalists lack the sources and experience to quickly verify sensational information  If news breaks on a truly important story  there should be a link to a credible news source  But I still regularly see tweets that have no connection to reality being retweeted thousands of times by people who should know better  Here s but one example of completely fictional  news  that was retweeted over 46 000 times  It involved Haiti s supposed reaction to President Trump s recent insult It was retweeted by the Harvard law professor Laurence Tribe  His retweet was retweeted over 2 000 times Yet there s no evidence anywhere that Haiti s  high court  did this  There was no  emergency  session and there was no  agreement to unseal   release documents   The event is fabricated  Remember  No link  Not news 2  I knew it  If breaking news on social media aligns perfectly with your carefully structured view of the world  then pause before liking it or retweeting it  Why  Because you   like most of us   have curated a personal news feed to confirm things you already suspected or  knew   If you didn t do this yourself  by unfriending people who dared argue politics with you on your feed   Facebook and Twitter are doing it for you  They structure your timeline to make it as agreeable as possible  Cambridge Analytica s success was premised on building a distribution system tailored to precisely exploit the biases and preconceptions of specified Facebook users But Cambridge Analytica is the symptom  not the disease  The larger problem is that unpleasant and frustrating information   no matter how accurate   is actively hidden from you to maximize your social media engagement  George Orwell once noted that he became a writer because he possessed  a facility with words and a power of facing unpleasant facts   There s no place for  unpleasant facts  in our social media universe  Were Orwell alive today  he d remind us of the terrible political costs caused by this devolution in our informational habits 3  Why am I talking  My wife is a psychotherapist  and occasionally I skim her Psychotherapy Networker magazine  I read a piece by a therapist who realized his most effective communicative moments often occurred when he asked himself a simple question   Why am I talking   Inevitably this question shut him up and allowed him to absorb much more information   Why am I talking  works out to a great acronym  WAIT  If we all just asked ourselves this simple question immediately before posting or retweeting  we d all be better off  There are numerous reasons to participate in the public sphere  and everyone can contribute something valuable  But there s also far too much noise out there  and we need to think more seriously and realistically about the added value of our own communication These are three simple rules  Of course  they contradict every mechanism Facebook and Twitter uses to encourage our behavior on social media  Being more skeptical  engaging more selectively and prioritizing links to information providers outside our social media silos will hurt the bottom line of the social media giants  Using social media in a more responsible manner might ultimately leave these companies to rot away as they cede their civic responsibilities to the Russian trolls and bots dedicated to polluting our discourse  If they won t act  it s up to us  If we re collectively smarter and more skeptical about social media as an information delivery device  it will ultimately lessen the influence that these corporations and trolls have on our civic governance Michael J  Socolow  author of  Six Minutes in Berlin  Broadcast

Politicians in the United States and Europe are calling for its chief executive  Mark Zuckerberg  to testify before them  Investors have cut the value of the social networking giant by about  50 billion in the past two days They are all focused on the same thing  whether Facebook mishandled users  data Facebook has built its highly profitable social network off its users  selling advertisements based on their ages  interests and other details  But the scrutiny over the company s vast trove of personal data   following a report that a political consulting firm had improperly obtained information of 50 million users   is taking direct aim at that lucrative formula  Investors are reacting to fears of regulation and the consequences of regulation   said Brian Wieser  a senior research analyst at Pivotal Research Group   The scale of errors can only lead one to conclude these are systemic problems  So far  most of the social network s top executives have been silent  Mr  Zuckerberg  its founder  and Sheryl Sandberg  his top deputy  have not made any public statements in recent days  The pair did not appear at an employee meeting on Tuesday in Menlo Park  Calif

disinformation during the presidential campaign and its response to it  The tensions have prompted the planned departure of Alex Stamos  Facebook s chief security officer  who plans to leave in August The pressure on Facebook has been building for years It started in the European Union  where regulators have taken an aggressive attitude toward Facebook and other American technology giants for their sway over the region s 500 million people  The company has been the subject of several privacy investigations and charges by European regulators  Europe has approved a new privacy law  which takes effect in May  that will give users of Facebook  Google and other internet services more control over how their data is collected and what Silicon Valley companies know about them After the 2016 presidential campaign  lawmakers at home joined the chorus of critics  citing the company s role in Russia s disinformation efforts  The social network was one of the top tools used by Russians to spread false news  and the company s executives have struggled to explain what happened and how they would prevent foreign interference in the future The Cambridge Analytica revelations have forced Facebook to scramble to assuage fresh concerns by regulators and lawmakers  The company is sending its representatives to Capitol Hill and arranging conversations with state attorneys general to try to answer questions about how the firm collected the information of Facebook users The social networking giant is also facing an investigation by the Federal Trade Commission  which is looking into whether Facebook violated an agreement with the agency  according to a person with knowledge of the inquiry The F T C  investigation is connected to a settlement the agency reached with Facebook in 2011 after finding that the company had told users that third party apps on the social media site  like games  would not be allowed to access their data  But the apps  the agency found  were able to obtain almost all personal information about a user           Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  The current investigation has parallels  The information on the 50 million users was harvested in 2014 by an outside researcher  Aleksandr Kogan  Mr  Kogan  a professor at Cambridge University  paid users small sums to take a personality quiz and download an app  which collected private information from their profiles and from those of their friends  Facebook allowed that sort of data collection at the time Photo                           Eric T  Schneiderman  New York s attorney general  said he was joining his Massachusetts counterpart in her investigation into Facebook s handling of user data   Consumers have a right to know how their information is used   and

                 Then  Mr  Kogan gave the information to Cambridge Analytica  a firm founded by Stephen K  Bannon  the former White House political adviser  and Robert Mercer  the wealthy Republican donor  Passing the information to a third party violated Facebook s policies  the company said last week  There are all sorts of obligations under the consent decree that may not have been honored here   said David Vladeck  a former director of consumer protection at the F T C The company could face fines of  40 000 a day per violation if the agency finds that Facebook broke the agreement  We are aware of the issues that have been raised but cannot comment on whether we are investigating   an F T C  spokeswoman said in a statement on Tuesday   We take any allegations of violations of our consent decrees very seriously  Facebook said it expected to receive questions from the F T C  related to potential violations of the 2011 consent decree   We remain strongly committed to protecting people s information   Facebook s deputy chief privacy officer  Rob Sherman  said in a statement   We appreciate the opportunity to answer questions the F T C  may have  The F T C  inquiry is just one piece of the regulatory backlash  On Tuesday  the New York attorney general  Eric T  Schneiderman  announced that he was joining the Massachusetts attorney general  Maura Healey  in an investigation into whether Facebook had failed to protect the privacy of users in those states  New Jersey s attorney general announced a similar investigation Mr  Schneiderman and Ms  Healey sent a letter to

Facebook staff members were scheduled to brief the office of Mr  Warner  the top Democrat on the Intelligence committee  and the offices of members of other committees  including Commerce  this week  The possibility that Facebook has either not been transparent with consumers or has not been able to verify that third party app developers are transparent with consumers is troubling   Mr  Thune said

user data from their site  and in particular about whether data had been taken without their consent   wrote Damian Collins  chairman of the British committee   Your officials  answers have

"AdvertisementOpinionSupported byTrump Hacked the Media Right Before Our EyesImageWe never stopped watching Credit Andrew Harrer BloombergBy Ross DouthatMarch 21  2018Let s get one thing straight  I am not a fan of Facebook  I m confident that social media is a cancer on our private lives and a source of derangement in our politics  I take it for granted that the tech barons are acquiring the power to tilt elections  and that they ll be happy to play handmaidens to tyrants soft and hard so long as they can monetize our data  I take a certain mordant pleasure in watching Mark Zuckerberg and his minions scapegoated for the political failures of late Obama era liberalism But the liberal establishment s fixation on Facebook s 2016 sins   first the transmission of fake news and now the exploitation of its data by the Trump campaign or its appendages   still feels like a classic example of blaming something new because it s new when it s the old thing that mattered more  Or of blaming something new because you thought that  new  meant  good   that the use of social media data by campaigns would always help tech savvy liberals and not their troglodytic rivals   and the shock of discovering otherwise obscures the more important role that older forms of media played in making the Trump era a reality No doubt all the activity on Facebook and the apparent use of Facebook s data had some impact  somewhere  on Trump s surprise victory  But the media format that really made him president  the one whose weaknesses and perversities and polarizing tendencies he brilliantly exploited  wasn t Zuckerberg s unreal kingdom  it wasn t even the Twitter platform where Trump struts and frets and rages daily  It was that old pre internet standby  broadcast and cable television  and especially TV news Start with the fake news that laid the foundation for Trump s presidential campaign   not the sort that circulates under clickbait headlines in your Facebook feed  but the sort broadcast in prime time by NBC  under the label of reality TV  Yes  as media sophisticates we re all supposed to know that  reality  means  fake   but in the beginning nobody marketed  The Apprentice  that way  across most of its run you saw a much bankrupted real estate tycoon portrayed  week after week and season after season  as a titan of industry  the for serious greatest businessman in the world Where did so many people originally get the idea that Trump was the right guy to fix our manifestly broken government  Not from Russian bots or targeted social media ad buys  but from a prime time show that sold itself as real  and sold him as a business genius  Forget unhappy blue collar heartlanders  forget white nationalists and birthers  The core Trump demographic might just have been Republicans who watched  The Apprentice   who bought the fake news that his television program and its network sponsors gladly sold them That was step one in the Trump hack of television media  Step two was the use of his celebrity to turn news channels into infomercials for his campaign  Yes  his fame also boosted him on social media  but there you can partially blame algorithms and the unwisdom of crowds  with television news there were actual human beings  charged with exercising news judgment and inclined to posture as civic minded actors when it suits them  making the decision to hand day after day of free coverage to Donald Trump s rallies  outrages  feuds and personal attacks Nothing that Cambridge Analytica did to help the Trump campaign target swing voters  and there s reason to think it didn t do as much as it claimed  had anything remotely like the impact of this  alwaysTrump tsunami  which probably added up to more than  2 billion in effective advertising for his campaign during the primary season  a flood that drowned all of his rivals  pathetic tens of millions  And as cynical as I believe the lords of Silicon Valley to be  the more important cynicism in 2016 belonged to those television execs who were fine with enabling the wild Trumpian takeover of the G O P   because after all Republicans deserved it and Hillary was sure to beat him in the end Except that she didn t beat him  in part because he also exploited the polarization that cable news  in particular  is designed to feed  In 2016 this polarization didn t just mean that Fox became steadily more pro Trump as he dispatched his G O P  rivals  it also meant that a network like CNN  which thrives on Team Red vs  Team Blue conflict  felt compelled to turn airtime over to Trump surrogates like Jeffrey Lord and Corey Lewandowski and Kayleigh McEnany because their regular stable of conservative commentators  I was one of them  simply wasn t pro Trump enough The depth and breadth of Trump skepticism among right wing pundits was a pretty solid indicator of his unfitness for high office  But especially once he won the nomination this skepticism was often filtered out of cable coverage  because the important thing was to maintain the partisan shouting match model  This in turn encouraged a sense that this was just a typical right versus left election  in which you should vote for Trump if you usually voted for Republicans   and in the end that s what most G O P  voters did My own CNN experiences were positive  I admire the many fine journalists who work in television news  But it was clear enough being in that orbit in 2016  as it should be clear to anyone who watched Trump s larger relationship to his television coverage  that the business model of our news channels both assumes and heightens polarization  and that it was ripe for exploitation by a demagogue who was also a celebrity It s also clear   as the economists Levi Boxell  Matthew Gentzkow and Jesse Shapiro wrote in these pages late last year   that among older white Americans  the core demographic where first the primaries and then the general election were decided  television still far outstrips the internet as the most important source of news  And indeed  the three economists noted  for all the talk about Breitbart s influence and Russian meddling and dark web advertising  Trump only improved on Mitt Romney s showing among Americans who don t use the internet  and he  actually lost support among internet using voters   In a sense  you could argue  all those tweets mattered mainly because they kept being quoted on TV Which is not to say that the current freakout over Facebook doesn t make a certain kind of sense  Beyond the psychological satisfaction of weaving the often genuinely sinister side of Silicon Valley into stolen election theories  there s a strategic wisdom to the center left establishment s focus on the internet What Trump did will be hard for a future demagogue to imitate  The generations who get their information from newscasts are dying out  the web is taking over at an accelerating pace and in the long run there is more to be gained in going after Mark Zuckerberg than in pillorying Jeff Zucker  And pillorying Fox s hosts only helps their brand  the big tech companies regard themselves as part of the liberal cultural complex  so they re vulnerable to progressive bullying and shaming  not so Sean Hannity  whose stalwart support for Trump was and remains vastly more important than any online stratagem In the end  as Michael Brendan Dougherty wrote recently for National Review  one implicit goal of the Facebook freakout is to ensure that  conservatives and populists will not be allowed to use the same tools as Democrats and liberals again  or at least not use them effectively   If the trauma of Trump s victory turns social media gatekeepers into more aggressive and self conscious stewards of the liberal consensus  the current freakout will have more than served its political purpose But like the television channels whose programming choices did far more than Facebook to make Donald Trump president  it won t have served the truth  I

profiles was secretly scraped and mined for voter insights  many Facebook users have decided to delete their accounts   but untangling yourself from a site like Facebook is not as easy as pressing

political data firm  many users are mulling whether it is time to leave the social network  Even a co founder of WhatsApp  which Facebook bought for  16 billion in 2014  declared that it was time to delete Facebook But while deleting your account is as simple as clicking on a few buttons  Facebook may be too ubiquitous to truly quit  For one  it would probably be inaccurate to say you have removed Facebook from your life just by leaving the site  Chances are you still use WhatsApp  the largest messaging app in the world  or Instagram  the most popular photo sharing app  Facebook owns both Keep in mind that Facebook isn t the only company capable of collecting your information  One big culprit  Web trackers  like cookies embedded into websites and their ads  They are everywhere  and they follow your activities from site to site You can quit Facebook if you simply find no joy in it  But if you re looking to leave for philosophical reasons concerning privacy  it s a futile effort  You may be better off tweaking your privacy settings on the site           Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Here are some answers to questions that many people are posing to The

using Facebook  Instagram and WhatsApp There is no real substitute for Facebook if you re looking for a social network that includes virtually everyone you meet in real life  Social networks are all about the people on them  and Facebook has more than 2 billion monthly users  You could consider Snapchat  which has about 187 million daily users  but it s a far different experience   you primarily use it to send photos that self destruct   with an interface that many people find confusing There are plenty of alternatives to WhatsApp  But they have drawbacks and aren t as far reaching as WhatsApp  which has more than 1 5 billion monthly users Signal is a solid app for secure encrypted messaging   but it is still a young service with a relatively small number of users  You might be able to get hundreds of your friends to join Signal  But chances are you have friends or family in other countries  and WhatsApp is the go to messaging service internationally  For example  practically every smartphone user in India   more than 200 million people   uses WhatsApp Another WhatsApp alternative is WeChat  a Chinese messaging app that has about a billion monthly users  But the majority of people on that service are in China  And WeChat faces its own privacy issues because of China s notorious reputation for mass surveillance  Tencent  the company that runs WeChat  denies that it stores the chat histories of its users  But WeChat users have been arrested over conversations they have had in the app  and chat transcripts have been used as evidence in court proceedings Instagram  which has more than 800 million monthly users  is also a tough one  giving Facebook a stranglehold on photo sharing  The only real competitor to Instagram is Facebook itself  which has its own photo sharing features  Remember Flickr  The Yahoo owned site is the closest thing either has to a competitor  and it s like a graveyard of people s digital memories before they abandoned it for Facebook and Instagram Google Photos is a compelling service  but it is a photo album management tool  not so much a social network How else do you keep in touch with friends and family  How do you create and discover events  How do you market and manage customer service for your small business  How do you spark and build grass roots movements      Newsletter Sign Up

are popular for keeping in touch with friends and family   a group chat between family members via text message  for example  is still an efficient way to keep in touch  And sites like MeetUp are designed for hosting and discovering events As for customer service  many companies use Twitter to engage with their customers and resolve complaints  Yelp  the reviews site for local businesses  is a common place for customers to talk about their experiences  and business owners often engage with people there For grass roots movements  a Twitter hashtag might be enough  Recent examples include  metoo  the movement for people to discuss sexual assault   deleteuber  the campaign to protest Uber last year amid political controversy  and now  there is the movement to  deletefacebook in response to the Cambridge Analytica controversy What does it mean to delete Facebook  How can you actually delete your account You can permanently delete your account by clicking a few buttons on Facebook s website  The company delays deletion for a few days  so do not log back in  Facebook also offers a tool for extracting a copy of your data before deleting your account After you delete your account  it won t be recoverable  But there are caveats Shadows of your digital self would remain on the site  For example  if people uploaded photos of you  those photos will still be there  The conversations you had with friends through Facebook won t disappear  either When you delete your account  you are only deleting the media you posted  like your status updates and photos that you uploaded  That s not going to do much for your privacy  considering that an overwhelming amount of what you do on Facebook involves engaging with other people  All of your friends  and their friends  too  would also have to delete their accounts in order to have any sort of meaningful effect What other things are you losing access to if you delete Facebook  Why do so many apps require a Facebook login           Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  One painful part of breaking up with Facebook would be potentially losing access to the many third party apps and websites that are tied to your account  Over the past decade  many shopping sites and apps teamed up with Facebook to use the company s login tool  Facebook Login Facebook Login became popular because it was a good product  By clicking a button  you could sign up for an account with an app or website just by sharing your Facebook account data  That allowed you to skip manually entering details like your name and email address   a process that is especially cumbersome on a small smartphone screen  This sped up the process of signing up for an account to buy that pair of shoes you saw go on sale If you were to delete Facebook  you would break your access to many sites and apps that you signed up for using Facebook Login  But fortunately  many sites and apps still let you sign up for accounts directly through them  and many also let you log in through your Google account It s not impossible to delete Facebook  But it would be a long and tedious process to create new accounts for all the apps and sites you use Where does Facebook really equal the internet Keep in mind that Facebook reaches well beyond the United States  As my colleague Sheera Frenkel noted on Twitter  deleting Facebook is a privilege  In some parts of the world  like Myanmar  Egypt and Indonesia  people rely on Facebook as a primary means to conduct business and stay in touch with friends and family  In Africa  Facebook has struck deals that offer basic services   centered on those provided by Facebook   to residents for free                          Brian X  Chen  our lead consumer technology reporter  writes about solving tech related

LONDON    The computer expert who alleges a trove of Facebook data was improperly used to help Donald Trump s White House bid said Tuesday that he strongly believes the information was also used by the Brexit movement that persuaded Britain to quit the European Union In a 3  hour hearing  Chris Wylie told the House of Commons media committee that he believes the breach exceeded the 50 million Facebook users reported earlier   though he didn t give an exact figure  And he said the data compiled by the political consulting business Cambridge Analytica was available to other firms with links to it  All kinds of people had access to the data   said Wylie  who helped develop Cambridge Analytica s methods for using the information to target and persuade voters   It was everywhere  Among the companies that had access to the data was AggregateIQ  a Canadian political consultant that did work for Vote Leave  the official campaign backing Britain s withdrawal from the EU  Wylie said

political gun for hire  often in countries where democratic institutions are weak  He suggested the company combines computer algorithms and dirty tricks to help candidates win regardless of the cost

presidential campaign Cambridge Analytica says none of the Facebook data was used in its work on the Trump campaign  It denies any wrongdoing Cambridge Analytica s acting CEO  Alexander Tayler  said in a statement that Wylie was a part time contractor who  has no direct knowledge of our work or practices  since he left the company Wylie said he  absolutely  believes AggregateIQ drew on Cambridge

University researcher leaked Facebook data of millions of people four years ago  Zuckerberg said this was a  breach of trust  and that Facebook is taking steps to make sure it doesn t happen again Facebook s privacy practices have come under fire after Cambridge Analytica  a Trump affiliated political consulting firm  got data inappropriately  The social media platform s stock value has dropped over  70 billion since the revelations were first published Among the newspapers with the ads were The New York Times and The Washington Post in the U S   and The Sunday Times and The Sunday Telegraph

psychological profile quiz back in 2014  But the quiz gathered information on their friends as well  bringing the total number of people affected to about 50 million           Advertisement  Continue

had to face another restive group  his own employees The Facebook chief executive has taken multiple steps over the past few days to communicate with the social network s 25 000 employees over revelations last week that a British political consulting firm  Cambridge Analytica  had improperly obtained data of 50 million Facebook users The Silicon Valley company held a staff meeting on Tuesday to answer questions about Cambridge Analytica  featuring one of Facebook s lawyers  Paul Grewal  On Wednesday afternoon  Mr  Zuckerberg addressed employees directly  according to two Facebook employees who asked not be identified because the proceedings were confidential  Mr  Zuckerberg also spoke with staff on Friday at a regularly scheduled employee meeting  said two people who attended the event Facebook declined to comment on the meetings Speaking to Facebook s employees was a crucial prong of what has become an apology tour of sorts for Mr  Zuckerberg over the Cambridge Analytica fallout  The revelations have raised calls for Mr  Zuckerberg to appear before Congress to explain himself  as well as a  DeleteFacebook movement and other criticism           Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Mr  Zuckerberg had stayed silent on the matter for days  until he released a statement on Wednesday vowing that Facebook had to do better and gave several interviews to quell the crisis  That has not stopped pressure from Congress  with bipartisan leaders of the House Energy and Commerce Committee saying on Friday that they had sent a formal request for Mr  Zuckerberg to appear in a hearing over Facebook s  harvesting and sale of personal information  related to Cambridge Analytica         Continue reading the main story                                Advertisement

over how the social network was used by Russian agents to influence the 2016 presidential election  Keeping workers engaged is crucial in Silicon Valley s highly competitive job market  where recruiting and retaining talent often is difficult against deep pocketed rivals Earlier this week  some Facebook employees had said that colleagues had started looking to transfer from the main social network product to other branches of the company  such as to messaging app WhatsApp and photo sharing site Instagram  which have been relatively unscathed by the recent scandals      Newsletter Sign

Facebook  It s such a shocking difference for company employees who are used to having esteem for where they work   said Eric Schiffer  chairman of Reputation Management Consultants  a consulting firm  and who has been speaking with people at Facebook   Ten years ago  Facebook was the hottest place to go out of college  This year  the best graduates are not necessarily looking at Facebook  When Mr  Zuckerberg did not appear at the Tuesday staff meeting hosted by the company lawyer  Mr  Grewal  his absence made headlines When he spoke to workers on Wednesday  Mr  Zuckerberg focused on concrete measures that Facebook was taking following the Cambridge Analytica reports  two employees said  Staff members asked questions about how Mr  Zuckerberg planned to regain user trust  especially in light of the  DeleteFacebook campaign from users  the two employees said Mr  Zuckerberg said the social network was investigating apps like the third party quiz app that had obtained access to  large amounts of information  from the social network  which had then been used by Cambridge Analytica  He also said the company would restrict third party developers  access and would notify users whose data had been harvested by Cambridge Analytica           Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Of the  DeleteFacebook campaign  Mr  Zuckerberg told The New York Times in an interview   I think it s a clear signal that this is a major trust issue for people  and I understand that  Three Facebook employees said morale had improved following the interviews and the internal communications that Mr  Zuckerberg did on Wednesday  One of them said he had avoided a trip home to see his family last weekend because he did not want to answer questions about the company he worked for On Friday  Facebook s senior managers promised an open line of communication as the company continued to re evaluate its privacy and security measures  said two employees There was a feeling  said one of the people  that Facebook wanted to take aggressive steps to make sure it could regain user trust  And over all  he said  confidence was up                  Follow Sheera Frenkel on Twitter

"AdvertisementOpinionSupported byOp Ed ContributorBeware of A I  in Social Media AdvertisingImageCreditYuichiro Chino Getty ImagesBy Dipayan GhoshMarch 26  2018Nine days ago  we learned that Cambridge Analytica  the firm engaged by the Trump campaign to lead its digital strategy leading up to the 2016 United States presidential elections  illegitimately gained access to the Facebook data of more than 50 million users  many of them American voters  This revelation came on the heels of the announcement made last month by the Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller of the indictment of 13 Russians who worked for the Internet Research Agency  a  troll farm  tied to the Kremlin  charging that they wielded fake social media accounts to influence the 2016 presidential elections But as Facebook  Google  Twitter and like companies now contritely cover their tracks and comply with the government s requests  they simultaneously remain quiet about a critical trend that promises to subvert the nation s political integrity yet again if left unaddressed  the systemic integration of artificial intelligence into the same digital marketing technologies that were exploited by both Cambridge Analytica and the Internet Research Agency According to the F B I  s findings  the tactics used to date by Russia have  technologically speaking  not been particularly sophisticated  Those tactics have included the direct control of fake social media accounts and manual drafting of subversive messages  These were often timed for release with politically charged incidents in the real world   including  for instance  the suicide bombings in Brussels  the declaration of Donald Trump as the Republican nominee and Mr  Trump s staging of a town hall in New Hampshire  each of which occurred weeks before election night in 2016  Further  according to various experts  Cambridge Analytica s targeting efforts likely were tame and ineffective Each step of the digital campaigns seems to have been orchestrated by a human working from a computer terminal  To be sure  we know that the Internet Research Agency s deception campaigns altogether enjoyed broad reach and were viewed by many Americans  more than 126 million of us may have unwittingly viewed the Russians  egregious and misleading content on Facebook alone  And if Cambridge Analytica did indeed make use of the rich trove of sensitive data it acquired from Aleksandr Kogan s firm Global Science Research  Cambridge Analytica s content too likely reached tens of millions of American voters  But because their digital messaging was largely controlled directly by a bottleneck of human propagators  its spread necessarily was relatively uncoordinated and ad hoc As the industry increasingly integrates artificial intelligence into digital advertising  however  disinformation operations and legitimate political communications will gradually become concerted  automatic and seamless  The real innovation in digital marketing   and the type of thing that the United States Congress and American voters should be particularly concerned about   is the execution of disinformation that operates at real scale  Where there were once a couple dozen human operators stitching together a few divisive messages during working hours in Moscow to pick at the digital halls of our democracy  there will soon be countless A I  systems testing and probing a plethora of content on a vast field of social media user audiences that are highly segmented by race  ethnicity  gender  location  socioeconomic class and political leaning  We can expect advisory firms like Cambridge Analytica  the Russians and other participants   not to mention our own political parties themselves   to pounce on this new vector for political messaging and take direct aim at our open political discourse Despite these myriad risks  industry professionals seem to have turned a blind eye to the oncoming specter of A I   likely because they are optimistic about its commercial potential  The leading internet firms are offering free A I  courses for their brightest engineers  are developing plans to integrate A I  across their leading brands and products  and are staffing up with brilliant philosophers  ethicists and technocrats to deflect nosy regulators and win over the merchants of information  In his interview with The New York Times last week  Mark Zuckerberg even went so far as to describe A I  as the antidote that will cure the internet of such negative externalities as hate speech and election interference  What internet firms are not transparent about  though  is the degree to which they plan to integrate A I  into their principal profit generating engine  digital advertising Consider the scale and complexity of the advertising ecosystem  Global internet firms like Facebook  Twitter  Snapchat and Google collectively enjoy billions of active users who on average spend more than two hours on these platforms every day  Each user might be shown hundreds or thousands of digital display ads   or  sponsored  content   within that time  People in the industry leverage an intricate web of ad agencies  exchanges  networks  demand side platforms and supply side platforms to manage the delivery of those ads around the clock But if you could remove those people from the equation  you could quietly turn a  100 billion digital ad industry into a  1 trillion persuasion machine To be clear  algorithms have long been part and parcel of the industry  Organizations like the Russian government and Cambridge Analytica were taking advantage of them simply by virtue of using social media for political communications  But the sharp uptick in industry research and development in A I  over the past year strongly suggests that this new technology will soon be brought to bear in digital advertising  This will increase the speed of ad mediation  inundating users with content finely tuned to their personal desires  It will abet the seamless and accurate development of  look alike  audiences  enabling advertisers to upload their customer lists and automatically send ads to like minded people that they do not already know  And it will enable automated contingency based marketing  allowing clients to programmatically trigger certain kinds of content to be shared in the moments after real world events transpire For students of disinformation   including the Russians who to date have not even had to leverage such sophisticated web technology to mislead American voters   this new information ecosystem presents a vast land of opportunity  One could imagine that the Internet Research Agency could set up automated  machine learning informed content targeting systems so that minutes after North Korea s leader references a hypothetical ICBM  the Russians send inflammatory A I  produced messages and imagery to classes of the American population that A I  has predicted will be susceptible to disinformation  The scalability of such activity is what makes such tactics especially fearsome Deep rooted societal tensions will likely be exacerbated by the irresponsible integration of A I  into digital advertising services   not to mention  into the ranking and curation of  organic  content on social media news feeds and search results  We re already seeing this  For example  just a few hours before Senator Marco Rubio took the stage to speak with students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School  ill taught algorithms were responsible for the spread of YouTube videos that mocked and shamed the students Even in light of the Cambridge Analytica revelations  there is time yet to act  Internet firms should aggressively work to limit disinformation on their platforms by developing algorithms   perhaps driven by A I   as suggested by Mr  Zuckerberg   that can detect disinformation and flag it for fast human review  Strong one off actions against widespread disinformation tactics  such as Twitter s recent move  can also help  They also must be more transparent about their algorithmic software and data practices with researchers  journalists and consumers  Further  the regulatory community must continue its aggressive review of the industry s practices  The Federal Trade Commission s announcement of its forthcoming investigation into Facebook s privacy practices represents excellent progress In the meantime  the public must not let up  The economic structure of the digital sector has already harmed our society in ways that have been exacerbated by the unchecked collection of individual behavioral data  The revelations about Cambridge Analytica and Russia s disinformation operations are prime evidence for this   and things could get worse very soon  Politicians and regulators must continue the call for a meaningful privacy law and stronger antitrust enforcement in this country  Nothing less can win us back full control

the developers did with the data and did Facebook have protective safeguards  including audits  to ensure developers were not misusing Facebook user data  They ve known about this for years and they

data violated a new Oregon law that makes it an unlawful trade practice for a business to collect  use or dispose of a consumer s information in a manner inconsistent with the business s own privacy

such a law  She noted that much of the activity under scrutiny took place before the law took effect  on Jan  1  but was confident that it would cover continued misuse of data  Facebook is just an unbelievably big platform   Rosenblum told AP   They have many opportunities to influence people     and that s why it s so important for them at the front end to be properly monitoring the developers

     LONDON    Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is promising to do a better job protecting user data following reports that a political consultant misused the personal information of millions of the company s subscribers  The fact is  European regulators are already forcing him to do so A similar data breach in the future could make Facebook liable for fines of more than  1 6 billion under the European Union s new General Data Protection Regulation  which will be enforced from May 25  The rules  approved two years ago  also make it easier for consumers to give and withdraw consent for the use of their data and apply to any company that uses the data of EU residents  no matter where it is based The law is the latest attempt by EU regulators to rein in mostly American tech giants who they blame for avoiding tax  stifling competition and encroaching on privacy rights  European analysts say GDPR is the most important change in data privacy regulation in a generation as they try to catch up with all the technological advances since 1995  when the last comprehensive European rules were put in place  The impact is likely to be felt across the Atlantic as well  For those of us who hold out no hope that our government will stand up for our rights  we are grateful to Europe   said Siva Vaidhyanathan  a professor at the University of Virginia who studies technology and intellectual property   I have great hopes that GDPR will serve as a model for ensuring that citizens have dignity and autonomy in the digital economy  I wish we had the forethought to stand up for the citizen s rights in 1998  the start of Google   but I ll settle for 2018            Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  The U S  has generally taken a light touch approach to regulating internet companies  with concerns about stifling the technology fed economic boom derailing President Barack Obama s 2012 proposal for a privacy bill of rights  But Europe has been more

Google s dominance among internet search engines and demanded back taxes from Apple and Amazon  The European Court of Justice in 2014 recognized  the right to be forgotten   allowing people to demand search engines remove information about them if they can prove there s no compelling reason for it to remain Now data protection is in the crosshairs of the 28 nation bloc  where history has made the right to privacy a fundamental guarantee  Nazi Germany s use of personal information to target Jews hasn t been forgotten  and the new Eastern European members have even fresher memories of spying and eavesdropping by their former communist governments In today s world  digital commerce companies collect information on every website users visit and every video they like  This data is the lifeblood of social media sites that give users free access to their services in exchange for the right to use that intelligence to attract advertisers But the Facebook scandal shows it can also be used for other purposes A whistleblower this month alleged that Cambridge Analytica improperly harvested information from over 50 million Facebook accounts to help Donald Trump win the 2016 presidential election  News reports have focused on the relationship between Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix  former Trump strategist Steve Bannon and billionaire computer scientist Robert Mercer  who bankrolled the operation Cambridge Analytica says none of the Facebook data was used in the Trump campaign  Facebook is investigating  The regulation is trying to balance the power between ourselves as individuals and organizations that use that data for a whole variety of services   said David Reed  knowledge and strategy director at DataIQ  a London based firm that provides research on data issues The EU s new rules expand the reach of regulations to cover any company that processes the data of people living in the bloc  regardless of where the company is based  Earlier rules were ambiguous on this point  and international companies took advantage of that to skirt some regulation  the EU says      Newsletter Sign Up     Continue reading the main story            headline   The

legislation also demands that consent forms are written in plain language anyone can understand  No more legalese across pages and pages of terms and conditions that few people read before clicking  I Agree   The regulations also require that consent must be as easy to withdraw as it is to give To ensure compliance  there s the potential for big fines  Under GDPR  organizations face fines of up to 20 million euros   25 million  or 4 percent of annual global turnover   whichever is greater   for the most serious violations Facebook reported  40 65 billion in revenue last year  That means a serious violation could cost the company as much as  1 63 billion Even though GDPR doesn t legally protect the data of people outside the EU  analysts expect many companies to apply the rules worldwide  Smaller firms are likely to decide it s too expensive to run multiple compliance systems  though bigger firms like Facebook and Google may still decide to  bracket off  European operations  Vaidhyanathan said Sarah T  Roberts  a professor of information studies at UCLA  says the EU is formulating the rules of engagement  rather than allowing internet companies to dictate  While U S  based platforms were created in the image of Silicon Valley  that type of bravado and no holds barred capitalism doesn t go down well in Europe  Despite claims that cyberspace is not fettered to planet Earth  that is not true   she said Facebook  for one  has taken notice  setting aside a page of its website to explain what the company is doing to comply with GDPR   We ve built tools to help people manage their data and understand their choices with respect to how we use their personal data   it says But GDPR is not a panacea that will ensure everyone s data is protected  Some analysts suggest the next step should be to ensure that everyone owns their own data and can sell it in exchange for services Pressure is building for increased regulation in the U S   where members of Congress have called on Zuckerberg to testify about the Cambridge Analytica scandal The alleged conspiracy has captured the public imagination  focusing worldwide attention on data protection

largely unchanged  A representative for Acxiom could not immediately be reached for comment Facebook declined to comment on how the change could affect its ad revenue Advertisers would still be able

including Acxiom  Experian  Oracle Data Cloud  TransUnion and WPP PLC None of the companies could immediately be reached for comment Facebook on Wednesday also put all its privacy settings on one page

LAWMAKERSFacebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg has repeatedly apologized for the mistakes the company made and has promised to crack down on abuse of the Facebook platform and restrict developers  access to user information There is a new Facebook page   called Access Your Information   where users can see what they have shared and manage it  The biggest difference is ease of access in settings  which fulfills Mark Zuckerberg s promise to make the privacy process and permissions more transparent to users   Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter said It was uncertain whether the changes will satisfy lawmakers They were announced ahead of a stringent European Union data law which comes into force in May  It requires companies to give people a  right to portability    to take their data with them   and imposes fines of up to 4 percent of global revenue for companies breaking the law Lawmakers in the United States and Britain are still clamoring for Zuckerberg himself to explain how users  data ended up in the hands of Cambridge Analytica He plans to testify before Congress  a source briefed on the matter said on Tuesday  Facebook has said it has received invitations to testify and that it is talking to legislators Zuckerberg and the CEOs of Alphabet Inc and Twitter Inc have been invited to testify at an April 10 hearing on data privacy  The U S  House Energy and Commerce Committee and U S  Senate Commerce Committee have also asked Zuckerberg to appear at a hearing The U S  Federal Trade Commission has opened an investigation into Facebook  and attorneys representing 37 states are also pressing Zuckerberg to explain what happened  Reporting by David Ingram and Julia Fioretti  Additional reporting by Laharee Chatterjee and Arjun Panchadar  Editing by James Dalgleish and Cynthia

data The system  which will be introduced to Facebook users globally over the coming weeks  will allow people to change their privacy and security settings from one place rather than having to go to roughly 20 separate sections across the social media platform From the new page  users can control the personal information the social network keeps on them  such as their political preferences or

practices more visible to consumers and to give consumers greater control over the immense amounts of personal information about them collected and shared by data brokers  How much of a difference these actions may make to Facebook s data privacy practices was unclear  Some privacy advocates noted  for instance  that the company s new centralized privacy and security settings page has been

     NEW YORK    Some 60 companies including such leading brands as Subway  Sprint and the NFL are joining forces to help each other follow you around online Adobe  a company better known for Photoshop and PDF files  says the new Device Co op initiative it is organizing will help companies offer more personalized experiences and make ads less annoying by filtering out products and services you have already bought or will never buy  Under the initiative  Adobe can tell you re the same person on a home PC  a work laptop  a phone and a tablet by analyzing past sign ins with member companies The initiative comes amid heightened privacy sensitivities after reports that Facebook allowed a political consulting firm  Cambridge Analytica  to harvest data on millions of Facebook users to influence elections  Facebook also has been criticized for collecting call and text logs from phones running Google s Android system Adobe s initiative underscores the role data plays in helping companies make money  Many of the initial uses are for better ad targeting           Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  The company timed Wednesday s announcement to a digital marketing conference it is hosting this week in Las Vegas  Adobe executives said they believed their initiative offers strong privacy safeguards and weren t worried about a backlash in light of the Facebook scandal         Continue reading the main story                                Advertisement  Continue reading the main story                       With this stuff coming out now around Cambridge

participating companies  which also include Allstate  Lenovo  Intel  Barnes   Noble  Subaru and the Food Network  Adobe says the program links about 300 million consumers across nearly 2 billion devices in the U S  and Canada The program would let Sprint  for instance  know that Bob is already a customer when he visits from a new device  Bob wouldn t get a promotion to switch from another carrier  but might get instead a phone upgrade offer  Or if Mary has declared herself a Giants fan on the NFL s app  she might see ads with Giants banners when visiting NFL com from a laptop for the first time All this might feel creepy  but such cross device tracking is already commonly done by matching attributes such as devices that from the same internet location  or IP address  Consumers typically have little control over it Adobe says it will give consumers a chance to opt out of such tracking  And it s breaking industry practices in a few ways  Adobe says it will honor opt out requests for all participating companies and for all devices at once  It s more typical for such setups to require people do so one by one  All companies in the initiative are listed on Adobe s website  a break from some companies  practice of referring only to unspecified partners  We re doing everything we can not letting brands hide themselves   Ahuja said But in taking an opt out approach  which is common in the industry  Adobe assumes that users consent  And it places the burden on consumers to learn about this initiative and to figure out how they can opt out of it

Reuters    A U S  judge has ordered Facebook Inc to let her review documents it has refused to give the Internal Revenue Service as that agency probes whether the social media company used an Irish unit to slash billions of dollars from its tax bill In an order on Tuesday night  U S  Magistrate Judge Laurel Beeler in San Francisco said she may review up to 15 of the 153 disputed documents  which Facebook believes are privileged or otherwise confidential  The government may select the documents for her to review According to the government  most of the documents concern a decision by Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg and other Facebook executives to set up an international headquarters in Dublin  Ireland  which occurred in 2010  and the transfer of assets such as worldwide user bases and online platforms there Facebook was warned by the IRS in July 2016 that the probe could boost its U S  tax bill by  3 billion to  5 billion  plus interest and penalties  for tax years beginning in 2010  It said last month it has set aside adequate amounts for the probe           Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  The Menlo Park  California based company declined to comment on Wednesday Beeler issued her order amid an unrelated worldwide outcry over Facebook s privacy practices  including the harvesting of user data by the London based Cambridge Analytica

YORK    Fair housing advocates sued Facebook Tuesday  saying it lets landlords and real estate brokers target advertising to discriminate against women  those with disabilities and families with children The lawsuit in Manhattan federal court alleges investigations by fair housing supporters in New York  Washington  D C   Miami and San Antonio  Texas  prove Facebook continues to let advertisers discriminate even though civil rights and housing groups have notified the company since 2016 that it is violating the federal Fair Housing Act  It seeks unspecified damages and a court order to end discrimination Facebook said in a statement that the lawsuit is without merit and the company will defend itself vigorously  There is absolutely no place for discrimination on Facebook   the company said The lawsuit was filed by the National Fair Housing Alliance and other organizations  It comes as Facebook faces criticism over allegations British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica used details of 50 million Facebook users to help Republican candidate Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential campaign           Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  The housing

to most advertisers  It said Facebook  with a customer base of over 2 billion people  collects a  treasure trove of information  to enable advertisers to target customers they believe are right for their businesses Then it lets advertisers scroll through hundreds of demographics  behaviors and interests to decide which characteristics they want to include or exclude  the lawsuit said

Facebook s online platform enabled advertisers to exclude from advertisements in the housing category those customers assigned black  Hispanic and other  ethnic affinities  It said the housing alliance was able to post a Facebook ad for a fictitious rental apartment after it selected options that excluded blacks and Hispanics from the ad s potential audience  After complaints  Facebook took steps to counter those kinds of discriminatory ads  the lawsuit said But it said additional work by ProPublica and the housing alliance revealed that as recently as weeks ago the company was approving advertising that  in effect  discriminated against mothers  families with young children and those with disabilities  Although Facebook stopped approving housing advertisements that used its  ethnic affinity  option in late 2017  it continues to create and develop content that facilitates advertisers excluding certain audiences based on legally protected characteristics   the lawsuit said It said Facebook from Dec  14 to Feb  23 had accepted 40 advertisements that the housing alliance and affiliates created that excluded potential home seekers based on family status or gender         Continue

     GENEVA    The scandal over data privacy that is causing a headache for Facebook Inc shows just one aspect of the huge task of preparing the world for e commerce  the United Nations trade and development agency UNCTAD said on Wednesday Facebook has faced a global outcry and its shares have slid in value after a whistleblower said data from millions of users was improperly harvested by consultancy Cambridge Analytica to target U S  and British voters  The current debate about Facebook and data privacy vividly illustrates that most countries are ill prepared for the digital economy   UNCTAD Secretary General Mukhisa Kituyi said in a statement Data privacy is just one of many boxes that national regulators need to tick if they hope to get a handle on e commerce  UNCTAD s head of internet and computer technology analysis Torbjörn Fredriksson told a news conference           Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Other issues include legal questions related to e

platforms instead of going to the retail shop that has bought everything in bulk   he said In developing countries  internet purchases are still mainly paid for with cash on delivery  and central banks and finance ministries need to help ensure access to online payment systems  Fredriksson added But most developing countries are still unclear about whose job it is to coordinate e commerce  he

creating a trade imbalance  There is some concern that     there is a risk of concentration of markets among the big platforms   Fredriksson said  adding that UNCTAD was working on ways to address the problem Although rich countries are thinking about how they need to adapt  poorer countries are largely flying blind  with no data for example on e commerce circumventing national trade rules  which could help the traffic in counterfeit goods  There are concerns about jobs that may be lost  taxation  customs revenue  there s a whole range of issues that are challenges more than opportunities perhaps   Fredriksson said  Governments are increasingly looking at it  but whether they are looking at it enough is another issue   Reporting by Tom Miles  Editing by Catherine Evans         Continue

was asked about Mr  Musk s warnings around artificial intelligence during a Facebook Live broadcast in 2017  he called Mr  Musk a  naysayer   That s an insult in a technology world that celebrates perpetual optimism  With A I  especially  I m really optimistic   Mr  Zuckerberg said   People who are naysayers and kind of try to drum up these doomsday scenarios   I just  I don t understand it  I think it s really negative and in some ways I actually think it is pretty irresponsible  In response  Mr  Musk shot back that Mr  Zuckerberg did not fully comprehend the issues  I ve talked to Mark

satellite called Amos 6  which was set to go to outer space in a SpaceX rocket  But the rocket exploded  Mr  Zuckerberg released a chilly statement  As I m here in Africa  I m deeply disappointed to hear that SpaceX s launch failure destroyed our satellite that would have provided connectivity to so many entrepreneurs and everyone else across the continent   he wrote on Facebook

storms hitting California this week have been called many things  but two related terms keep popping up to describe this weather system   atmospheric river  and  Pineapple Express  So which one is it  Pineapple Express was a term for many years used to identify storms that came from Hawaii and hit the West Coast   said Marty Ralph  a research meteorologist affiliated with U C  San Diego s Scripps Institution of Oceanography   About 15 years ago we recognized that there s a broader definition called an atmospheric river  and those happen all over the planet  For non scientists  atmospheric rivers can be conceptualized visually  If you look from space from a satellite  it does look like a sinuous river   said Daniel Swain  a climate scientist at U C L A   It s a colorful term  and it s actually the official meteorological term to describe this process            Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  But while all Pineapple Express storms are atmospheric rivers  not all atmospheric rivers are classified as Pineapple Express storms The source for the particular atmospheric river hitting California this week is near the Hawaiian Islands  hence the playful  Pineapple Express   Not everyone agrees  though  that this storm falls under that category  I wouldn t call this one a Pineapple Express  The storm is coming from the West  but the tail of this atmospheric river didn t come from Hawaii  it came from east of Hawaii   Mr  Ralph said   But I m not sure about arguing the jargon too much on this  The modern term is atmospheric river  Nomenclature aside  Mr  Swain urged residents in burn areas not to ignore the orders because of storm fatigue  Though the storm may not hit Los Angeles too hard  it could wallop those in Santa Barbara County  The forecast is severe  and if water falls too quickly it could lead to substantial flooding and mudslides  The forecast is for a really  really big rain   he said   Maybe half a foot or more of water is going to fall in a lot of places that have had intense fire activity  Whether all those inches of rain fall over three days or in a six hours is hard to predict    California Today goes live at 6 a m  Pacific

 Sheryl Sandberg  said last week that shoring up trust was their priority   We know this is an issue of trust  We know this is a critical moment for our company   Sandberg told CNBC on Thursday It is

she said  It s psychologically harder to let go of a platform like Facebook that s become pretty well ingrained into people s lives   she said One reason that Facebook and other internet companies

that opposition to Donald J  Trump by the party s national security establishment had opened the door for two foreign policy advisers whose interactions with Russian intelligence prompted F B I  scrutiny The Republicans said they had found no evidence that either man  George Papadopoulos and Carter Page  had colluded with the Russians  despite the F B I  s interest in the men  Nor did campaign advisers and aides provide evidence that any member of the Trump campaign had colluded either  according to summaries of 44 findings and more than two dozen recommendations the committee voted to release Thursday  When asked directly  none of the interviewed witnesses provided evidence of collusion  coordination or conspiracy between the Trump campaign and the Russian government   one

release a Republican written 250 page report over the objections of the committee s Democrats  who offered a series of unsuccessful last ditch motions to subpoena witnesses and documents  as well as to urge the House to hold Stephen K  Bannon  Mr  Trump s former adviser  in contempt  It was a fundamentally unserious effort   said Representative Adam B  Schiff of California  the top Democrat on

Republican cooperation  They have secured the cooperation of at least one new witness  Christopher Wylie  who helped found Cambridge Analytica and develop the company s voter profiling technology The Republican report chronicles Russia s increasingly brazen efforts in the run up to the 2016 election to compromise the United States  political institutions and fan existing divisions among voters  It concludes that the response by the Obama administration had been  insufficient  and said an October 2016 public statement calling out Russia proved  ineffective  The report takes issue with the  analytical tradecraft  used by intelligence agencies that concluded that President Vladimir V  Putin of Russia had wanted to harm the candidacy of Hillary Clinton and help Mr  Trump More divisive are the findings on collusion  That subject remains an area of inquiry by the Senate Intelligence Committee and the special counsel  Robert S  Mueller III  who took over the F B I  s investigation of the Trump campaign last year           Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  The House Republicans said that they had found repeated contacts between members of the Trump campaign team and

Republicans said they were  concerned  about Mr  Page s  seemingly incomplete accounts  of a summer 2016 trip to Moscow  they noted that he had not been traveling on behalf of the campaign  Possible Russian efforts to set up a  back channel  with Trump associates after the election suggest the absence of collusion during the campaign  since the communication associated with collusion would have rendered such a  back channel  unnecessary   the Republicans wrote in another finding Many of the committee s recommendations center on the securing of the United States  voting systems and echo those presented by the Senate Intelligence Committee in recent days  including steps to improve communications of threats between states and the federal government and to ensure voting systems are not hacked Others could prove more controversial  For instance  the Republicans recommend that Congress consider repealing the Logan Act  a 1799 statute that bars private citizens from interfering with American diplomatic relations  The statute has never been successfully used in court but has been discussed in connection with contacts between Michael T  Flynn  Mr  Trump s first national security adviser  and the Russian ambassador at the time during the presidential transition They also recommend that the executive branch consider mandatory polygraph tests for political appointees with top secret security clearances who are not confirmed by the Senate                          Get politics and Washington news updates via Facebook  Twitter and the Morning Briefing newsletter

amazing future This optimism is reflected in the price of Dropbox s shares after they traded publicly for the first time on Friday  They leaped to  29 per share from  21  giving Dropbox  which charges businesses and individuals to store files on its computers  a market value of  12 7 billion  Putting that number in context reveals the bullishness of investors  Dropbox didn t have any profits in recent years  so comparisons have to be done using revenue and cash flows         Continue reading the main story                                Advertisement  Continue reading the main story                      At  29  Dropbox is trading at 11 5 times last year s revenue of  1 1 billion  That is far higher than the 2 6 times sales for the companies in the Nasdaq index  according to Bloomberg data Of course  Dropbox s shares have benefited from demand for initial public offerings by technology companies  The stock might give back the gains  just as Snap s did after its I P O  last year Still  Dropbox s fans believe that the company has a strong financial future  despite competition from the likes of Google and Amazon  One of their main arguments is that the company can increase its revenue faster than its costs  a dynamic that should expand profit margins over time  Rishi N  Jaluria  an analyst at D A  Davidson  zeros in on its free cash flows  the amount of cash generated by a business after subtracting spending on plants and certain lease payments  to show this His measure of free cash flows was equivalent to 16 percent of revenue last year  but  in his estimation  that margin could rise to 19 percent this year  then 22 percent in 2019 After Friday s huge pop  Dropbox s stock has arguably  priced in  the impressive future cash flows that some analysts expect  Indeed  using Mr  Jaluria s forecasts  Dropbox s shares are already trading at a far higher cash flow valuation than that of Salesforce  a software and cloud computing company with a long track record What is more  Dropbox has areas of concern that should  in theory  give investors pause  The number of paid users grew 25 percent last year  slower than the 35 percent rate in 2016  Its average revenue per paying user edged up just 1 percent last year  Facebook s shares trade at the same multiple to sales as Dropbox s  Yet its revenue per user surged 26 percent last year   Peter Eavis

seem to like them This can be seen in the way the stock market has responded to the trade restrictions  which were announced on Thursday but were flagged a few days earlier  The S  P  500 index was down 5 95 percent this week  falling every day but one  And the selling at the end of the week looked like like it was turning into a rout  with the S  P  500 skidding 2 52 percent on Thursday and 2 1 percent on Friday We know that Mr  Trump watches the stock market s response to his policies  He was reassured when the stock market rose after he announced tariffs on imported steel and aluminum  Will this week s nosedive unsettle him to the point he softens his stance on trade with China  Mr  Trump sounded unfazed on Friday   I think the stock market is going to be great   he said

The president abruptly backed down from his threat to veto the  1 3 trillion spending bill and signed it into law on Friday  avoiding a government shutdown Early in the day  the president had tweeted his displeasure with the bill  citing Congress s failure to fund his long promised border wall From this morning                       I am considering a VETO of the Omnibus Spending Bill based on the fact that the 800 000 plus DACA recipients have been totally abandoned by the Democrats  not even mentioned in Bill  and the BORDER WALL  which is desperately needed for our National Defense  is not fully funded                    Donald J  Trump   realDonaldTrump          March 23  2018          Julie Hirschfeld and Michael D  Shear of the NYT But the president was most angry about the lack of funding in the bill for a massive wall on the nation s southern border that he has billed as the centerpiece of his crackdown on illegal immigrants  The measure includes nearly  1 6 billion for border security   including new technology and repairs to existing barriers   but not Mr  Trump s wall  as he claimed on Twitter on Wednesday  It provides  641 million for about 33 miles of fencing  but prohibits building a concrete structure or other prototypes the president has considered  and allocates the rest of the funding for new aircraft  sensors and surveillance technology  The backstory to the bill  Here s how Congressional leaders settled lawmakers  objections  Mark Zuckerberg and the congressional hearing aheadAs Facebook plunged into a crisis over how Cambridge Analytica  a political consulting firm that provided voter targeting services to the Trump campaign  improperly obtained data on 50 million Facebook users  Mark Zuckerberg came under criticism for saying nothing  Finally  on Wednesday he released a statement and sat down for interviews  We asked Paul Pendergrass  a long time corporate communication professional and formerly DealBook s  Jack Flack  columnist  to offer his insights into the situation  In most of the interviews on Wednesday  Mark Zuckerberg was asked if he would be willing to testify before Congress  a task he has previously delegated to other senior Facebook executives  I d be happy to   he told CNN s Laurie Segall  before immediately qualifying that answer with   if it s the right thing to do  He then went on to offer Facebook s standard response to questions about why it has previously chosen other executives for Congressional hearings The goal there is to get Congress all the information that they need to do their extremely important job  And we just want to send the person whoever is best informed to do that He elaborated The question in Congressional testimony is   What is the goal   That s not a media opportunity  At least it s not supposed to be Mr  Zuckerberg was surely being coy  When Congress requests the presence of a C E O  embroiled in a high profile controversy  they re usually not looking for information  They want a pelt to hang on the wall  and celebrity chief executives are particularly attractive So it s definitely a media opportunity  but for members of Congress  not the C E O If Mr  Zuckerberg wants proof of that  he can ask John Stumpf  the former C E O  of Wells Fargo  and the bank s current chief executive  Tim Sloan  how much information they were asked to provide  He could ask the same of the C E O  of United Airlines  Oscar Munoz  about his trip to Capitol Hill just after a passenger was dragged off one of his airplanes  For that matter  Mr  Zuckerberg could walk down the hallway and ask Facebook s general counsel  Colin Stretch  Just last fall Mr  Stretch endured a Senate lashing over the use of Facebook by Russian operatives When Mr  Zuckerberg is brought in to testify  the committee s  goal  will be to ensure the American public understands why social media platforms can t be trusted to regulate themselves  Mr  Zuckerberg s goal will be to try to avoid acting in a way that would elevate his role as the designated villain in the story           Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Mr  Zuckerberg seems resigned to the fact that he will likely end up testifying   I would imagine at some time there will be a topic where I will be the sole authority on  and it will make sense for me to do it   he told Ms  Segall After this past week  he will have little leeway to refuse  Having been roundly accused of hiding in the crucial early days of the Cambridge Analytica scandal  he won t want to provide further evidence that he is inaccessible when people need to see him most Photo                                        Credit             Joe Skipper Reuters                     Elon Musk joins  DeleteFacebook Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg have

questions mounted last year about whether Facebook had been exploited to tilt the U S  presidential election  Mark Zuckerberg landed on a fishing trawler off Alabama s Gulf coast But the chatter surrounding the CEO s arrival in port was that it signaled something bigger than just the start of a 30 state personal tour  his designs on a job even more powerful than leading the social network that links 2 2 billion people worldwide  I asked him if he was interested in running for president of the United States   said Dominick Ficarino  who owns a shrimp business in Bayou La Batre  Alabama  and hosted Zuckerberg that afternoon   And his answer to me was   Can I answer you with a question  If you were me  would you   Thirteen months later  Zuckerberg no longer has the luxury of mulling a hypothetical next act  Instead  he is grappling with a crisis that has enveloped the company synonymous with his face and name  It does not help that the most glaring reminder of Facebook s flaws is the unabated uproar over the American presidency itself           Advertisement  Continue reading the main story   The world feels anxious and divided  and Facebook has a lot of work to do   Zuckerberg wrote in January  laying out his annual  personal challenge          Continue reading the main story                                Advertisement  Continue reading the main story                      In 2017  the billionaire sought to travel to every state he d never visited  This year  Zuckerberg said his personal goal is to  fix  Facebook Yet things continue to get worse  Scrutiny of Facebook has intensified following reports that it failed to prevent the data mining firm Cambridge Analytica from amassing personal information about millions of users   possibly used to aid Donald Trump s campaign   and that the social network has been collecting Android users  phone call and text message histories without notice  That adds to criticism that Facebook manipulates its users and has allowed Russian bots to divide Americans by spreading false information On Monday  the Federal Trade Commission announced it was investigating Facebook for its privacy practices Zuckerberg preaches transparency  but flinches at questioning  He is undeniably brilliant  but stubborn about acknowledging the extent of Facebook s problems Is he prepared to do all it will take the right the ship  If he fails to do it  it may take a while but eventually people are going to rebel   said Roger McNamee  an early Facebook investor and adviser who has become a pointed critic  I thought Facebook was a force for good in the world for a really long time   McNamee said   I think it s really hard to make that case today  Days after Trump s election  Zuckerberg was pressed on the possibility that foreign agents had used his social network to divide voters           Advertisement  Continue reading the main story   The idea that fake news on Facebook     influenced the election in any way  I think  is a pretty crazy idea   the CEO said at a technology conference  I think all of us were shocked to learn how wrong he was   said David Kirkpatrick  the author of a 2010 book about Facebook who questioned Zuckerberg that day Zuckerberg walked back the remark soon after  continuing a years long routine of self correction  But errors that reflect his stubbornness  those who know him say  are tempered by an eagerness to learn and a deep sense of reflection Naomi Gleit  Facebook s longest serving employee after the CEO  said Zuckerberg   who declined an interview request from The Associated Press   has talked about making the world a better place since he was 21  But his view of his place in that world seemed like  a burden of responsibility   she said      Newsletter

inexperience has sometimes played out in public view  such as when he donated  100 million to Newark  New Jersey  schools in 2010 with few specifics outlining how the money should be spent  He was just a very young  naive  inexperienced guy who was brilliant     but just really didn t know much about how the world worked   said Dale Russakoff  author of  The Prize   a book chronicling the Newark experiment Zuckerberg and his wife  Priscilla Chan  have since chartered their own foundation to take on mammoth goals  like a  3 billion investment to cure  prevent or manage all diseases To free up his fortune for philanthropy  Zuckerberg last year pushed board members to restructure Facebook s stock  allowing him to sell off part of his stake while maintaining control  That prompted a suit by a group of shareholders who argued that the move would benefit only Zuckerberg while diluting the value of other investors  stakes  The company dropped the plan           Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  The gambit hints at the complexity of being Zuckerberg  who advocates for transparency and community but whose individual interests don t always align Zuckerberg  who has 105 million Facebook  friends   is compelled to share far more about himself than would be expected of another CEO  Yet he fiercely guards his privacy  Intellectually  he believes in transparency   Kirkpatrick said   But emotionally  it s very difficult for him  Shortly before the 2016 election  McNamee sent a letter to Zuckerberg and Facebook s chief operating officer  Sheryl Sandberg  warning the company was being manipulated in ways its creators never intended  It wasn t just about the U S  election  A consulting firm had collected data on people interested in the Black Lives Matter movement and sold it to police departments  and critics had detected a well organized  clandestine campaign supporting Brexit McNamee said he has been disappointed in the incremental changes announced since  but Zuckerberg s supporters say he is unfairly blamed Hoffman  the LinkedIn co founder  credits him with leading Facebook through a shift in mindset  nudging users into a more positive virtual environment   without completely shutting out inflammatory content Kirkpatrick argues  though  that Zuckerberg still must deal with existential threats to Facebook s business   its potential to negatively affect democracy and the way it hooks in users  I do not think he has yet grasped the gravity with which his service is being perceived to be a socially harmful force all around the world  And I also don t think he realizes the extent to which that really is true  McNamee  recalling Zuckerberg as a 22 year old visionary  said the CEO must be willing to rethink long held assumptions  But that does not mean he has to abandon building his global community           Advertisement  Continue reading the main story   You ve achieved more than your wildest dreams   McNamee said he would tell Zuckerberg if asked again for his counsel   You re a billionaire  Now you have a chance to be a hero          Continue reading the main story                                 We re interested in your

"AdvertisementSunday ReviewSupported byOpinionDon t Delete Facebook  Do Something About It ImageCreditJosh Edelson Agence France Presse   Getty ImagesBy Siva VaidhyanathanMarch 24  2018On March 16  as the buzzer sounded in perhaps the worst upset in N C A A  tournament history  and my beloved University of Virginia went down to the 16th seeded University of Maryland  Baltimore County  I had one thought  I need to deactivate my Facebook account  I did not want to endure the taunts and trash talk of my friends who cheer for Duke I do this often  When I need to focus on a project or relax a bit  I turn off the noise that comes from Facebook   the constant stream of disturbing faces  angry comments and shallow pulls on my precious attention  I also lose the lovely pictures of puppies and babies  But sometimes it s worth it to retreat from the addictive torrent of stimuli framed in blue If you feel the same way about how Facebook affects your daily life  by all means suspend or even delete your account  not that Facebook makes it easy to   But don t pretend it will make a difference to Facebook or to the state of the world A Twitter movement known as  DeleteFacebook is motivated by the stream of terrible things that Facebook has been involved in  including the proliferation of hate speech  harassment and propaganda meant to undermine trust in democratic institutions  The final spark was the news that the British political data firm Cambridge Analytica had acquired Facebook data on 50 million Americans But even if tens of thousands of Americans quit Facebook tomorrow  the company would barely feel it  Facebook has more than 2 1 billion users worldwide  Its growth has plateaued in the United States  but the service is gaining millions of new users outside North America every week  Like most global companies  Facebook focuses its attention on markets like India  Egypt  Indonesia  the Philippines  Brazil and Mexico  At current rates of growth  it could reach three billion users by 2020 People in those countries are getting value out of Facebook  in some places  it s one of the few reliable ways to keep in touch  In much of the developing world  Facebook is also the only news source that matters  This should horrify us  But it s not a problem that will be solved by indignant Americans leaving the service Moreover  quitting Facebook lets Google and Twitter off the hook  It lets AT T and Comcast and its peers off the hook  The dangers of extremist propaganda and hate speech are just as grave on YouTube  which is owned by Google  Russian agents undermining trust in institutions and democracy are even more visible on Twitter  And every major telecommunications firm  as well as Google and Twitter  relies on surveillance systems similar to the one Facebook uses to run targeted advertising  Facebook is bigger and better at all of this than the others  but its problems are not unique Facebook s problems are not peripheral  not just some rough edges that can be sanded down  Its core functions are to deploy its algorithms to amplify content that generates strong emotional responses among its users  and then convert what it learns about our interests and desires into targeted ads  This is what makes Facebook Facebook  This is also what makes Facebook such an effective vehicle for promoting so much garbage and what makes it the most pervasive personal surveillance system in the world  As long as that s true  don t expect Facebook to fix itself Hope lies  instead  with our power as citizens  We must demand that legislators and regulators get tougher  They should go after Facebook on antitrust grounds  Facebook is by far the dominant social platform in the United States  with 68 percent of American adults using it  according to the Pew Research Center  That means Facebook can gobble up potential competitors  as it already has with Instagram  and crowd out upstarts in fields such as artificial intelligence and virtual reality The Department of Justice should consider severing WhatsApp  Instagram and Messenger from Facebook  much as it broke up AT T in 1982  That breakup unleashed creativity  improved phone service and lowered prices  It also limited the political power of AT T The European Union has already stepped up its legal efforts to protect data  Its General Data Protection Regulation  which goes into effect in May  is intended to ensure that users understand and consent to data collection and how that data is used  Users won t have to agree to give access to their data to start using a product As with some recent American consumer finance regulations  data collection policies under the new European Union rules must be clear  concise and in plain language  Companies will have to declare up front how they will use the data  and users can withdraw consent at any time  This should significantly deter many abuses that companies like Facebook and Google have committed  It won t repair the sins of the past  But it s something Regulatory interventions have limitations  As long as Facebook is big and rich  its algorithms will determine and distort much of what we read and watch  Our long term agenda should be to bolster institutions that foster democratic deliberation and the rational pursuit of knowledge  These include scientific organizations  universities  libraries  museums  newspapers and civic organizations  They have all been enfeebled over recent years as our resources and attention have shifted to the tiny addictive devices in our hands If we act together as citizens to champion these changes  we have a chance to curb the problems that Facebook has amplified  If we act as disconnected  indignant moral agents  we surrender the only power we have  the power to think and act collectively  We could even use Facebook to mount campaigns to rein in Facebook  It is  after all  a powerful tool for motivation  even if it s a terrible tool for deliberation So go ahead and quit Facebook if it makes you feel calmer or more productive  Please realize  though  that you might be offloading problems onto those who may have less opportunity to protect privacy and dignity and are more vulnerable to threats to democracy  If the people who care the most about privacy  accountability and civil discourse evacuate Facebook in disgust  the entire platform becomes even less informed and diverse  Deactivation is the opposite of activism Siva Vaidhyanathan is a professor of media studies at the University of Virginia and the author of the forthcoming book  Antisocial Media

Silicon Valley  returns to HBO Sunday after a particularly terrible week for Silicon Valley  as Facebook dealt with fallout from revelations about the Cambridge Analytica data breach and Uber notched a horrific milestone  The first pedestrian killed by a driverless car  The tech world of four or five years ago is definitely different than now   said Mike Judge  the creator of the show  The public conception of Silicon Valley as a place of whiz kids in hoodies  boldly claiming all the time that they were making the world a better place  has been replaced with something darker  he said For its fifth season  TV s  Silicon Valley  has undergone changes of its own  albeit of the less tragic variety  The largely luckless Pied Piper crew finally finds itself in charge  as well as a man down  T  J  Miller  the excitable comic who played the feckless blowhard Erlich Bachman  last seen in a Tibetan opium den in Season 4  left the show  bashing colleagues in interviews on the way out   In December  after Mr  Miller had quit the series  he was the subject of sexual assault allegations involving a former college classmate  he has denied the allegations  Mr  Judge was previously best known for creating the long running  King of the Hill  as well as diverse cult favorites that have had equally lengthy afterlives  like  Beavis and Butt Head    Office Space  and  Idiocracy   The new direction of  Silicon Valley   along with the changes and struggles in the tech world  has him reassessing his original plan to end the show after six seasons   It s taken on a second wind   he said         Continue reading the main story                                Advertisement  Continue reading the main story                       How many seasons did  Dallas  go   he added   I think it could go that long    For the record  14  Photo                           Thomas Middleditch in the show s new season                                       Credit             Ali Paige Goldstein HBO                     In a phone conversation  Mr  Judge discussed the new season  Mr  Miller s departure  possible reboots of  King of the Hill  and  Idiocracy  and which of his creations are his favorites  These are edited excerpts from the conversation For the first time  the Pied Piper crew is running things  Did that change how you approached the story           Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  It felt pretty natural  In a way  some of this to me is analogous to stuff that happens in Hollywood  I started out making animated shorts in my house by myself  Then when  Beavis and Butt Head  happened  I had people fighting over it   there was the stress of  am I getting screwed here  And eventually I had about as many people working for me on  Beavis and Butt Head  as Richard  Thomas Middleditch  does in Season 5  and that became just as stressful  I m not someone who enjoys telling people to do something they don t want to do  and Richard is the same way  So there s plenty of comedy that can come from stuff like that How did T  J  Miller s departure affect the show Had he left after Season 1 or 2  it would have been really rough to try to make it work  But now it s actually kind of perfect timing because we were having trouble keeping him in the story  Not because of him  just because his character is not a programmer  He s just the guy who owned the house  We had done a bunch of comedy about that  about how he s kind of marginal and trying to make himself relevant  We have a lot of really great characters and actors  and I try to service them all  So it actually freed us up in the writing   Mr  Judge declined to comment on reports that Mr  Miller had been a disruptive presence on the set  What did you make of his bomb throwing exit   Laughs   It seemed very much like T  J    I m sure he wouldn t have it any other way  He s a brilliantly funny guy  I ve seen these quotes   he s always been a good put down artist  But yeah  I don t know what to really make of it  and it s not any of my business anymore  you know Jian Yang  Jimmy O  Yang  has been the new  expletive  of the house for a while  and he becomes a bigger one  like on a grander scale  And there are a lot of other characters picking up the slack  Laurie  Suzanne Cryer   there s more of her and Monica  Amanda Crew   There s definitely a lot more Jared  Zach Woods   And we ve got a really great robot coming up The show started off making fun of the goofy grandiosity of the tech industry  but the current perception of Silicon Valley is more critical  Has the show changed as a result      Newsletter Sign Up     Continue reading the main story            headline   Watching   summary   Get recommendations on the best TV shows and films to stream and watch  delivered to

Because we write it several months ahead of when it airs  we were already kind of noticing  just because we talk to a lot of people  in the industry  and a lot of them are just starting to realize the lack of conscience  And if they re not realizing that  people are pointing it out to them  I noticed when I worked in the tech world that there s just this belief that every gain they make is for the good of mankind  and never really questioning it  I m not saying they re all horrible people  but they look at the task at hand and don t really consider whether it s right or wrong Or whether people want their data to be sold to political operatives Yeah  and actually we deal with that this season  with what Richard s building  It s like that quote  If you re getting the service for free  then you re the product  Those servers and all the infrastructure and engineers cost money  So  you re paying by them looking for keywords in your email and popping ads up Which is familiar to anyone who s had a sneaker ad follow them around online Yeah a friend of mine told me through text message what hotel he was going to be staying at in Nashville  and the next thing I know  there s an ad for it on my Facebook page  It s all tied together Fox has said it wants to bring back  King of the Hill   Would you be involved in that Yeah  if they did  There have been a couple discussions about it  and about how we would do it  but nothing concrete yet  I think you d have to have Bobby and all of them be older  The Simpsons are such iconic characters  Bart could be that age forever because it s a more surreal show  But with  King of the Hill  being on 13 years  I think people were really starting to wonder why Bobby s still the same age           Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Another old film of yours   Idiocracy   from 2006  has become a common reference point for  well  many things happening right now  Do people mention this to you On Twitter  like all day long  There was at one point talk about possibly a series  an animated series  a reboot like that  There were talks of musicals  I would like to have another stab at it one way or another  It was almost like a bigger concept than it was a movie   it was difficult to make and probably should have been a TV show  But yeah  I get it all the time  which is nice  But I don t really know what to make of it  or how much of it relates to the movie when people throw around the word  idiocracy  on Twitter Well when the C E O  of Carl s Jr  gets nominated for a cabinet position  That s what was really weird for me  specific things like that  There s Carl s Jr   The company had a notably unflattering presence in the film   There was the W W E  thing   The president in the movie was a former professional wrestler  in real life  President Trump appeared in a World Wrestling Entertainment match in 2007  Even when we were shooting the movie  the wardrobe designer showed me these shoes   they weren t out in the world yet  And she said   This is a start up  they re making these shoes and they re going to look completely ridiculous   Plastic shoes with holes in them  And I said to her   The only thing I m worried about is  what if these things blow up and by the time the movie comes out  they re everywhere   And she said   Oh  that s never going to happen  No one is going to buy these things   And then  the movie comes out  and they are all wearing Crocs  and those shoes were just becoming huge  So  I think that was a sign that maybe a lot of these dumb things are going to come to pass It was the Croc in the coal mine  Laughs   Oh man You have a remarkable track record of creating things that seem to stick with people  whether it s  Idiocracy  or  Office Space  or characters like Hank and Bobby Hill  Do you have a personal favorite That s a hard one to pick  I m probably a little partial to Beavis  Beavis and Butt Head  but mostly Beavis  I d say Lumbergh  from  Office Space   is another one  I d say those two probably come to mind the most because   well  I don t know Well for Lumbergh   I m old enough to remember when an office job sounded great  I worked at Jack in the Box and worked construction  those kinds of jobs  and I remember thinking   Oh my God  you can work in an office  That would be wonderful   And then the first time I did it  I had that type of boss   that passive aggressive boss  I would rather have a guy yelling at me on a construction site  I had done an animated version but the way Gary Cole played that character  I thought that was something really great that hadn t been done yet  So  I don t know  I m pretty proud of that one                Correction  March 27  2018  An earlier version of this article included a quotation from Mike Judge that

derided the United Nations by citing its 38 story headquarters in New York   If it lost 10 stories   he said   it wouldn t make a bit of difference  As it happened  Mr  Bolton went on to serve as the United States ambassador to the United Nations  perhaps the most undiplomatic of diplomats  But if President Trump wanted a national security adviser who would match his blunt  hard edge  confrontational approach to the world  then Mr  Bolton fits the bill With his trademark bushy gray mustache and his take no prisoners style  Mr  Bolton positioned himself to the right even of the foreign policy veterans who emerged from President George W  Bush s administration  a hawk among hawks  a hard liner who thrills conservatives and chills moderates and liberals  From his perch on Fox News  he has impressed Mr  Trump with a muscular vision of American power and a dark assessment of America s adversaries When he takes over as Mr  Trump s third national security adviser in 14 months  Mr  Bolton will almost surely encourage Mr  Trump s instincts against diplomatic agreements both consider weak and unwise  He shares the president s derisive opinion of the Iran nuclear deal and will presumably prod him to scrap it when a May deadline arrives  He likewise takes a dim view of international agreements like the Paris climate change accord  from which Mr  Trump announced last year that he would withdraw the United States  He has called the  two state solution  for Israel and the Palestinians dead           Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  But Mr  Bolton is not always in step with a president who sometimes veers back and forth between threatening  fire and fury  and eagerly seeking talks with foreign leaders  Mr  Bolton argues the virtues of pre emptive military action against North Korea and scorns diplomacy of the sort Mr  Trump has embarked on with Kim Jong un  He promotes more punitive sanctions against Russia rather than the kind of hand holding flattery of President Vladimir V  Putin that Mr  Trump practiced even this week  He supported the Iraq war  which Mr  Trump calls a catastrophic mistake         Continue reading the main story                                Advertisement  Continue reading the main story                      In an interview on Thursday evening on Fox  Mr  Bolton said he recognized that his role would be to play the honest broker bringing different views to the president  and that it would be up to Mr  Trump to make the decisions But he made clear that he also planned to be Mr  Trump s enforcer  When the president makes a decision  he said  part of his job will be  making sure the bureaucracies get the decision and implement it  Mr  Bolton criticized the frequent leaks out of Mr  Trump s national security team  saying that a president cannot conduct diplomacy  if some munchkin in the White House  is leaking information to the news media   Leaking of that sort is simply unacceptable   he said Mr  Bolton s appointment elicited mixed reviews   Selecting John Bolton as national security adviser is good news for America s allies and bad news for America s enemies   said Senator Lindsey Graham  Republican of South Carolina   He has a firm understanding of the threats we face from North Korea  Iran and radical Islam  Critics  however  expressed concern that a bomb thrower in words could become a bomb thrower in deeds   Bolton played a key role in politicizing the intel that misled us into the Iraq War   Senator Edward J  Markey  Democrat of Massachusetts  wrote on Twitter   We cannot let this extreme war hawk blunder us into another terrible conflict  Clifford Kupchan  the chairman of the Eurasia Group  a consultant firm  sent a note to clients warning that Mr  Bolton s appointment  increases risk across the board   adding that it  makes U S  foreign policy  America First on Steroids   At one point  Mr  Bolton toyed with running for president himself  only to back off  Instead  he created an organization to support like minded candidates  His  super PAC  was one of the earliest customers of Cambridge Analytica  which has found itself confronting a deepening crisis after reports last weekend that the firm had harvested the data from more than 50 million Facebook profiles in its bid to develop techniques for predicting the behavior of individual American voters           Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  The firm was founded with a  15 million investment from Robert Mercer  the wealthy Republican donor who has backed both Mr  Bolton s PAC and Mr  Trump  Cambridge s so called psychographic modeling techniques  which were built in part with the data harvested from Facebook  underpinned its work for the Trump campaign in 2016  setting off a furious debate about the merits of the firm s methods  The same techniques were also the focus of its work for Mr  Bolton s PAC Using the psychographic models  the company designed advertisements from candidates supported by Mr  Bolton s PAC  including the 2014 campaign of Thom Tillis  the Republican senator from North Carolina  One advertisement  a video that was posted on YouTube  was aimed at fearful and neurotic voters   it emphasized security and the idea that Mr  Tillis could keep the United States safe      Newsletter Sign Up     Continue reading the main story

Bolton also recorded a video used by a Russian gun rights group in 2013 to encourage Moscow to loosen gun laws  according to a report by NPR  The report said the video was part of an effort by Russian and American gun rights groups to collaborate in the years leading up to the 2016 election A native of Baltimore  Mr  Bolton  69  received undergraduate and law degrees from Yale University  In between stints in private practice  he took a series of increasingly important jobs in government  starting at the United States Agency for International Development under President Ronald Reagan and later as an assistant attorney general After the 2000 election  Mr  Bolton joined the Republican legal team in Florida during the recount battle between Mr  Bush and Vice President Al Gore  After the Supreme Court halted the recount  resulting in Mr  Bush s victory  Dick Cheney  the new vice president  persuaded the incoming secretary of state  Colin L  Powell  to make Mr  Bolton an under secretary in charge of arms control  In that role  he helped pull the United States out of the Antiballistic Missile treaty but negotiated a separate treaty with Russia paring nuclear arsenals When Condoleezza Rice succeeded Mr  Powell  she rebuffed pressure from Mr  Cheney to make Mr  Bolton her deputy  Instead  Mr  Bush nominated him for the United Nations post  but key Republicans opposed him  including a former assistant secretary of state who testified that Mr  Bolton was a  kiss up  kick down sort of guy  who abused underlings After the Senate refused to confirm Mr  Bolton  Mr  Bush gave him a recess appointment instead   a decision he would come to regret  Mr  Bolton clashed regularly with Ms  Rice and  after leaving office  broke with Mr  Bush over what he saw as weak kneed policies on North Korea and Iran He titled his memoir  Surrender Is Not an Option   and called the Foreign Service officers in the State Department s East Asian and Pacific Affairs Bureau the  EAPeasers   He even went after Mr  Bush   Nothing can erase the ineffable sadness of an American presidency  like this one  in total intellectual collapse   he wrote in The Wall Street Journal Mr  Bush bristled and  in a private meeting with a group of conservatives  said   Let me just say from the outset that I don t consider Bolton credible   Other former colleagues fought back more publicly  Christopher Hill  who negotiated with North Korea for Mr  Bush  dismissed Mr  Bolton as  Phyllis Schlafly with a mustache            Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  After Mr  Trump s election in 2016  Ms  Rice and other Bush administration veterans like former Defense Secretary Robert M  Gates and Stephen J  Hadley  the former national security adviser  privately warned against an appointment for Mr  Bolton Mr  Trump considered Mr  Bolton for several posts but ultimately backed away each time  Unlike some of them  national security adviser does not require Senate confirmation  In the interim  Mr  Bolton has repeatedly praised Mr  Trump on television and in his Wall Street Journal columns even when the two disagreed He wrote on Twitter this month that sanctions on Mr  Putin and his inner circle needed to be tougher   If you want to punish a country for behavior you don t accept  you need punishing sanctions that are broad  not targeted  and they need to be enforced   he wrote In a Journal column  he made the case for a pre emptive military strike against North Korea   Given the gaps in U S  intelligence about North Korea  we should not wait until the very last minute   he wrote   That would risk striking after the North has deliverable nuclear weapons  a much more dangerous situation   Other options  he told a reporter  would be persuading China to topple North Korea s government or reuniting the peninsula under South Korean rule  although he acknowledged neither was likely A couple of weeks ago  he went on Fox to disdain South Korea s willingness to negotiate with North Korea   They re like putty in North Korea s hands   he said   As the great international relations theorist P  T  Barnum put it  there s a sucker born every minute   Two days later  Mr  Trump accepted an invitation to meet with North Korea s Mr  Kim As he prepared to take on his new assignment  however  Mr  Bolton was careful to minimize any differences with Mr  Trump  Asked Thursday evening on Fox about the president s decision to congratulate Mr  Putin on winning an election that most of the world considered a sham  Mr  Bolton said   I don t consider it a significant point one way or the other   adding   it s a matter of being polite                   Matthew Rosenberg  Michael D  Shear and Emily Cochrane contributed reporting          Follow Peter

questions mounted last year about whether Facebook had been exploited to tilt the U S  presidential election  Mark Zuckerberg s to do list landed him on a fishing trawler off Alabama s Gulf coast But the chatter surrounding the CEO s arrival in port was that it signaled something bigger than just the start of a 30 state personal tour  his designs on a job even more powerful than leading the social network that links 2 2 billion people worldwide  It was one of the last things I asked him  thinking it would put a smile on his face   and it did   said Dominick Ficarino  who owns a shrimp business in Bayou La Batre  Alabama  and hosted a dockside lunch for Zuckerberg that Sunday afternoon  I asked him if he was interested in running for president of the United States  And his answer to me was

hypothetical next act  Instead  he is grappling with a crisis that has enveloped the company synonymous with his face and name  It does not help that the most glaring reminder of Facebook s flaws is the unabated uproar over the American presidency itself         Continue reading the main story                                Advertisement  Continue reading the main story                       The world feels anxious and divided  and Facebook has a lot of work to do   Zuckerberg wrote in January  laying out the  personal challenge  that he sets for himself each year In 2017  the billionaire challenged himself to travel to every state he d never visited  This year  long after critics began demanding an overhaul  Zuckerberg said his personal goal is to  fix  the platform that he has engineered to build community   but that is increasingly blamed for warping it Yet things continue to get worse  Scrutiny of Facebook has intensified following reports that it failed to prevent the data mining firm Cambridge Analytica from amassing personal information about millions of users   possibly used to aid Donald Trump s campaign   and that the social network has been collecting Android users  phone call and text message histories without notice  That adds to criticism that Facebook manipulates its users and has allowed Russian bots to divide Americans by spreading false information On Monday  the Federal Trade Commission announced it was investigating Facebook for its privacy practices Throughout the mounting crisis  Zuckerberg s response has been a study in contradictions  He crisscrossed the country  even as his company back home came under increasing fire  He preaches transparency  but flinches at questioning and craves privacy  He is undeniably brilliant  but stubborn in his reluctance to acknowledge the extent of Facebook s problems Even his critics say he is uniquely capable of righting the ship  But at 33  is he prepared to do all it will take  If he fails to do it  it may take a while but eventually people are going to rebel   said Roger McNamee  an early Facebook investor and adviser who has become one of the company s most pointed critics           Advertisement  Continue reading the main story   I thought Facebook was a force for good in the world for a really long time   McNamee said   I think it s really hard to make that case today     Days after Trump s election  Zuckerberg was pressed on the possibility that foreign agents had used his social network to divide voters  The idea that fake news on Facebook     influenced the election in any way  I think  is a pretty crazy idea   the CEO told the audience at a California technology conference  I think all of us were shocked to learn how wrong he was   said David Kirkpatrick  the author of a 2010 book about Facebook who questioned Zuckerberg that day   You can certainly say that he was culpable  in that he was naive and inattentive to what was happening in his system  But I don t think he was lying  Zuckerberg walked back the remark soon after  continuing a years long routine of self correction  But errors that reflect his stubbornness  those who know him say  are tempered by an eagerness to learn from mistakes and a deep sense of reflection Donald Graham  the former chairman of the Washington Post Co   recalled that when he met Zuckerberg in 2005  outsiders still weren t sure what to make of Facebook  I would ask him a question and he would pause long enough   15 seconds  20 seconds   that I would think  Did I insult him  Did he not hear me    said Graham  who went on to serve on the company s board from 2008 to 2015  Since I am from Washington  I m not used to people thinking before they are answering a question      But Mark  then as now  was thinking about the right answer            Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Zuckerberg s boyish appearance  even today  is a reminder of just how young he was when he created what would become the world s biggest social network  back in his dorm room at Harvard  I didn t know anything about building a company or global internet service   he wrote in January   Over the years I ve made almost every mistake you can imagine  Naomi Gleit  Facebook s longest serving employee after the CEO  said Zuckerberg   who declined an interview request from The Associated Press   has been talking about making the world a better place since he was 21  But his view of that world and his place in it  seemed almost like a gravity  a burden of responsibility   she said That seriousness coincides with a sense of certainty Gleit recalled Zuckerberg s steadfast attachment to a Facebook message service similar to email  even as more people began using phones to send text messages  But co workers eventually swayed the CEO  whom she described as a  learn it all   That change of mind informed Facebook s 2014 purchase of the WhatsApp messaging service for  19 billion  I think he would even say now that he was initially wrong   Gleit said With Zuckerberg   it s experiment  learn  experiment  learn   said LinkedIn co founder Reid Hoffman  who has known him since 2004  Hoffman said that is evident in Zuckerberg s enthusiasm for software  which can be overwritten to fix problems  That facility  he said  makes Zuckerberg the equal of executives with far more experience But in the process of learning  Zuckerberg s inexperience has sometimes played out in public view    In 2010  Zuckerberg announced on Oprah Winfrey s television show that he would donate  100 million to schools in Newark  New Jersey Critics labeled it an attempt to polish his image  just as the biopic  The Social Network  was being released  Still  there was little questioning his generosity  The problem was that Zuckerberg   who knew little about education   made the gift with few specifics outlining how it should be spent           Advertisement  Continue reading the main story   He was just a very young  naive  inexperienced guy who was brilliant at technology and computers and the internet  but just really didn t know much about how the world worked   said Dale Russakoff  author of  The Prize   a book chronicling how the money went to high priced consultants  with minimal effort by leaders to build community support By the end of the process  Zuckerberg had developed a clearer understanding of how to get things done  He and his wife  Dr  Priscilla Chan  have since chartered their own foundation and structured it to take on mammoth goals  like a  3 billion investment to cure  prevent or manage all diseases  He has pledged to donate 99 percent of his Facebook stock to philanthropy  Zuck s maturation has occurred in front of the public   said Kirkpatrick  author of  The Facebook Effect  The Inside Story of the Company that Is Connecting the World     But he also still lives with the consequences of the decisions he made when he was less mature  At Facebook  Zuckerberg has grown increasingly bold in using huge sums of money to pursue corporate goals  which includes purchasing competitors   or companies that could grow into competitors      Newsletter Sign Up     Continue

Facebook s  1 billion purchase of Instagram in 2012   then unprofitable and little known   came as a shock to Wall Street  Two years later came the multibillion dollar deal to buy WhatsApp  a company that remains unprofitable but has given Facebook a prime portal into developing countries and other regions outside the U S In 2014  soon after Facebook bought a virtual reality firm called Oculus  Zuckerberg found himself being grilled in a lawsuit brought by a competitor who accused an Oculus executive of stealing trade secrets  Under questioning  he talked about the pressure he exerted to make the Oculus deal happen  and his vision of growing it so fast  that we can get every developer and studio in the world building just for Oculus before any big competitor exists  Last year  in a bid to free up his fortune for philanthropy  Zuckerberg pushed board members to restructure Facebook s stock  allowing him to sell off part of his stake while maintaining control  That prompted a suit by a group of shareholders who argued that the move would benefit only Zuckerberg while diluting the value of other investors  stakes  Days before Zuckerberg was scheduled to testify as part of the suit  the company dropped the plan The gambit hints at the complexity of being Zuckerberg  who advocates for transparency and the interests of the community but whose individual interests don t always align The paradox is self inflicted  the trade off for creating a venture premised on users  willingness to share details of their lives  That requires Zuckerberg  who has 105 million Facebook  friends   to reveal far more about himself than would be expected of any other CEO  whether it s photos of him and Chan baking sweets for the Jewish holiday of Purim or dressing their daughters for the Chinese New Year           Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Yet he fiercely guards his privacy When calls went out last year for Zuckerberg to testify before a Senate committee  the company sent its lawyer  And when he and Chan bought 700 acres on the Hawaiian island of Kauai last year  they quietly filed lawsuits against hundreds of Hawaiians   withdrawn after protests   that would have cut off locals  access to the land by negating their interest in small ancestral tracts within the estate s boundaries  Intellectually  he believes in transparency   Kirkpatrick said   But emotionally  it s very difficult for him      Facebook works hard to present Zuckerberg as someone deeply interested in the ordinary people whose lives are at the heart of its business Stops on last year s U S  tour  never announced  were set up by facilitators who revealed details to only a select few  But many of the visits were covered by the media and documented in professional quality photos on Zuckerberg s Facebook page soon after he d departed Ostensibly  the idea was for Zuckerberg to learn  But in their brief interactions  many people were just as interested in finding a way to connect with him In Hazard  Kentucky  educator Paul Green became custodian of the small town s biggest secret  A staffer from Zuckerberg s foundation  peppering Green with questions about the region s educational cooperative  finally admitted it was because the CEO himself wanted to visit  Green s reward for keeping it quiet was seeing the wide eyed grins when Zuckerberg pulled up and greeted local high schoolers studying robotics and programming Walking through science demonstrations  Zuckerberg spent more time trading tech tales with the teenagers than quizzing the teachers  He just lit up with those kids   Green said   The way he talked with them about some of the things he did when he was in school and his passion for technology  it really was cool            Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  When Zuckerberg toured an oil rig near Williston  North Dakota  last July   from the minute he got out of the car to the minute he got back in the car  he was nothing but questions   said Ron Ness  president of the North Dakota Petroleum Council  which arranged the visit  I had Bakken shale  limestone  dolomite  and he was able to hold them in his hand  along with a bottle of crude oil  And I remember him asking   How do you get that oil out of that rock    geologist Kathleen Neset said In Dayton  Ohio  Zuckerberg met with officials  caregivers and families battling drug addiction  Lori Erion  the founder of the group Families of Addicts  said she told him what it was like to learn her daughter  April  had shot up heroin in their own home  It seemed to get him really emotional   Erion said  recalling how Zuckerberg stood up suddenly and told the group he needed a few minutes to steady himself  When he returned  he asked what makes an addict stay clean and how families got their loved ones into treatment  We didn t ever talk about Facebook at all   Erion said   which is really interesting because Facebook is really the main way of us getting information out  He really was just like a regular person     As Zuckerberg connected with Americans face to face  controversy over Facebook continued to spiral Shortly before the election  McNamee sent a letter to Zuckerberg and Facebook s chief operating officer  Sheryl Sandberg  warning that Facebook was being manipulated in ways its creators never intended  It wasn t just about the U S  election  A consulting firm had collected data on people interested in the Black Lives Matter movement and sold it to police departments  and critics had detected a well organized  clandestine campaign supporting Brexit All this pointed to a deep problem with Facebook   that it was simply not equipped or not willing to prevent the misuse of its platform           Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  McNamee said he has been disappointed in the incremental changes announced since Facebook has adopted this  libertarian philosophy that says  we are not responsible for anything downstream  we are allowed to disrupt media  we are allowed to addict our users and we are not responsible for any of the consequences of any of that    he said Zuckerberg could change that  But McNamee said it is not enough to hire thousands of workers to weed through fake and abusive posts if those posts keep getting through  And tweaking Facebook s newsfeed so users see more posts from families and friends does not address his certainty that the algorithms underlying Facebook make it dangerously addictive  You cannot cure addiction by doing more of the thing that got you addicted in the first place  which is what Zuck recommends   McNamee wrote in an email Critics say Facebook continues to ignore the possibility of the social network being used for dark purposes  but Zuckerberg s supporters counter that he is unfairly blamed for problems he could not have foreseen Hoffman  the LinkedIn co founder  credits Zuckerberg with leading Facebook through a shift in mindset  making changes that will nudge users into a more positive virtual environment   without completely shutting out inflammatory content  Facebook basically is saying we enable people based on the way they behave  That s a very democratic argument  If people want to live in filter bubbles  who are we to say  Don t live in filter bubbles   even though we don t want them to   Hoffman said But Kirkpatrick argued that Zuckerberg s and Sandberg s surety that Facebook has a positive impact on society has blinded them to parallel realities  The company can t be fixed  Kirkpatrick said  until Zuckerberg comes to terms with existential threats to the way the social network does business   its potential to negatively affect democracy and the way it hooks in users  There s no question in my mind that Mark Zuckerberg is an ethical and responsible human being who wants to do the right thing   he said   However  I do not think he has yet grasped the gravity with which his service is being perceived to be a socially harmful force all around the world  And I also don t think he realizes the extent to which that really is true  McNamee  recalling Zuckerberg as a 22 year old visionary  said the CEO must be willing to rethink long held assumptions  But that does not mean he has to abandon building his global community           Advertisement  Continue reading the main story   You ve won   McNamee

allegations made in Tuesday s hearing   Cambridge Analytica said in a statement  adding that Wylie had left the company in July 2014 and would have no direct knowledge of its work or practices since then  It is wrong to suggest that Cambridge Analytica s earlier relationship with Aggregate IQ implies that we were involved with their work for Vote Leave  Cambridge Analytica did no work in any capacity in the 2016 EU referendum  AIQ did not respond to a Reuters request for comment after Tuesday s committee hearing  but in an earlier statement said it had never entered into a contract with Cambridge Analytica and had never been part of the firm The parliamentary committee s chairman has said it was  astonishing  that Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg decided not to answer lawmakers

Facebook  No wonder  After a rocky initial public offering in 2012  it has rolled over one obstacle after another  including the shift to mobile computing and the rise of photo sharing  It delivered revenue and user growth that surpassed even the most optimistic projections By the end of last year  Facebook had 2 2 billion active users  Its stock rose 53 percent last year  single handedly accounting for 3 7 percent of the 21 8 percent gain in the Standard   Poor s 500 stock index  according to S  P  Dow Jones Indices  By early February  its market capitalization had surpassed  560 billion  making it the fifth most valuable company in the index By then Facebook alone accounted for nearly 2 percent of the S  P  500 index  which means that anyone who owns a broad based stock mutual fund or index fund probably owns Facebook shares  Sophisticated investors and institutions  too  have considerable exposure  Goldman Sachs analysts reported last month that Facebook was the second most widely held stock  after Amazon  by hedge funds Over 90 percent of Wall Street analysts covering the company deemed Facebook a  buy  in early February  even though  at  195 a share  its price to earnings ratio  a common valuation measure  was a lofty 35   The average ratio now is about 24  historically  it has been about 15            Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  It was  as Wall Street pundits like to say   priced for perfection  Whatever else can be said about Facebook s recent tribulations  this much is certain  Its situation is far from perfection

used to try to influence Britain s vote to leave the European Union and the United States presidential election  the social network giant faces multiple investigations in both Europe and the United States  along with potentially profit crimping regulations and limits to its use of data  And investor retribution has been swift Since hitting its peak on Feb  2  Facebook has lost an astonishing  100 billion in market capitalization  Its stock was trading midweek at close to  153 a share  a decline of nearly 22 percent   It rebounded by about 4 5 percent Thursday and closed at  159 79  With Facebook s plunge  investor concerns have spread to other social media and internet stocks with lofty multiples  like the so called FANG stocks   Facebook  Apple and Amazon  Netflix and Google   and Twitter  They accounted for more than 10 percent of the S  P  500 at their peak              Falling Star                                      Since 2014  Facebook has been one of the hottest stocks in the market  but its recent troubles have caused it to lose about a quarter of its value                                          g facebook stock box  g artboard     margin 0 auto       g facebook

          Source  Thomson Reuters   By The New York Times                        People who own an index fund need to realize how important Facebook is  and how big a role it and the FANG stocks played in the market s rise   said Howard Silverblatt  senior industry analyst for the S  P  Dow Jones Indices  who oversees statistical analysis for the S  P  500   The FANG leadership is faltering  Social media hasn t faced much regulation  and now there s a cloud hanging over those companies  In the midst of past Facebook euphoria  few saw this coming  One that did was Aiera  a robot that uses artificial intelligence to make stock recommendations  Aiera  an acronym for artificially intelligent equity research analyst  put out a  sell  recommendation for Facebook last fall So did Brian Wieser  a senior analyst at Pivotal Research Group  who covers media and internet companies  Although he was positive about the stock for most of its long climb  he downgraded Facebook to  sell  last summer based on regulatory and advertiser concerns and what he now considers  systemic management issues  Not only was it a lonely position  but  the stock went up and up   Mr  Wieser told me this week   But I thought the market was wrong  full stop            Advertisement  Continue reading the main story   I didn t know what the catalyst would be  but at some point revenue growth had to slow and the margins go down   he said   There are practical limits  And I felt investors were looking at Facebook in much too positive a light  They just ignored all the bad things  and there were a lot of them  Then  when the news broke this month that a British firm  Cambridge Analytica  had used Facebook data for voter profiling  Mr  Wieser said  he thought it was  the most significant thing that had happened to Facebook since it became a public company       Newsletter Sign Up     Continue reading the main story            headline   Sign up for the all new DealBook newsletter   summary   Our

going to be a reckoning that even now I don t think most investors fully appreciate  The other Facebook skeptic  Aiera  can talk  but Wells Fargo   whose global internet analyst  Ken Sena  developed the robot along with Bryan Healey   wasn t making its wunderkind available for interviews  But based on Aiera s published comments  it issued its sell recommendation after analyzing the frequency of negative mentions in the media of Russia s use of Facebook to influence the presidential election  as well as fundamental valuation and technical factors   Aiera uses artificial intelligence to read and analyze a half million pieces of data per day gleaned from the internet  It currently analyzes more than 1 600 stocks  Wells Fargo has stressed that Aiera remains in experimental mode  but one potential advantage is that it removes all human emotion from its analysis  Thus  Aiera was indifferent to the fact that nearly every other analyst had a buy recommendation on Facebook Photo                           With Facebook s plunge  investor concerns have spread to other social media and internet stocks                                       Credit             Drew Angerer Getty Images                     That included her putative master  Mr  Sena  who was thrust into the somewhat awkward position of explaining his own buy recommendation even as Aiera said sell When I spoke to him this week  Mr  Sena stressed that Aiera was a tool that could detect patterns and eliminate bias   Aiera said election interference was a big deal  and it turned out it was a big deal   Mr  Sena said   But it s not meant to supplant human judgments  He hasn t changed his buy recommendation even though he agrees with Mr  Wieser that investors need to take threats of regulation seriously   The conventional wisdom was that people don t care that much about how their data is used   Mr  Sena said   They like the convenience of targeted advertising  But the level of public outcry over this is new    Facebook is going to have to do a lot of explaining    he added   I believe they have the capability and the technology to make the platform secure  But it s going to distract from other initiatives investors are counting on for growth  like virtual reality and video content            Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Even so  Facebook s decline has been so steep that even Mr  Wieser and Aiera may reassess their recommendations if they calculate that the stock has bottomed out When he last reiterated his sell recommendation  Mr  Wieser s price target was  152   I don t want to be trigger happy on this   he said   It s not clear yet what happens next  I want to fine tune my thoughts before I revisit this  Aiera canceled her sell recommendation after the stock plunged  She hasn t yet made a new recommendation  Of 45 analysts who cover Facebook  41 currently have a  buy  or  overweight  recommendation  up from 39 a month ago   Mr  Sena is even more bullish on Facebook than he was before  and hasn t changed his price target of  230   People are still glued to Facebook and Instagram   he said Its price to earnings ratio is now just 28  barely above the market average  which makes it  the cheapest stock in our coverage area  and it has some of the best growth prospects   he said   There s no way mathematically to justify a loss of more than  70 billion in market cap                 Correction  March 29  2018  Because of an editing error  an earlier version of a picture caption with this article misstated the given name of Facebook s chief

Analytica whistle blower  brought Canada into a story that s drawn intense scrutiny to Facebook this week  And it s not just because he s from Victoria  British Columbia After focusing close attention on the social network with the disclosure that Cambridge used personal data from millions of the social media site s users without permission to help Donald J  Trump s election campaign  Mr  Wylie brought a company from his hometown  Aggregate IQ  into the fray this week during testimony before Britain s Parliament Photo                           Christopher Wylie in London last week

s parent  drew on Cambridge s Facebook data to sway social media opinion in favor of the Leave side in the 2016 British referendum on the European Union vote  and he repeated claims that the Canadian company was used to avoid British campaign spending limits   The company has denied the claims  Attention inevitably turned to Mr  Wylie s activities in Canada  When he was 19  Mr  Wylie worked briefly in the office of Michael Ignatieff  then the Liberal leader  Then early in 2016  when Mr  Trump s victory was not being widely predicted  Mr  Wylie  through a company called Eunoia Technologies  was given a 100 000 Canadian dollar contract by the Liberal Caucus Research Bureau  Like all of the political parties  research shops  the bureau is separate from the party s other operations and is funded by Parliament Photo                           Prime Minister Justin Trudeau at the House of Commons on Wednesday  Canadian political parties are not covered by internet

not have access to the party s data and that he worked on projects that appeared to have involved monitoring social media  identifying issues and analyzing how Liberal members communicate with voters

Wylie s time in Ottawa  however  brought to light something that most people have overlooked  Unlike businesses and the federal government itself  federal political parties aren t subject to Canada s internet privacy and data protection laws Some of those laws date to the 1980s and the federal privacy commissioner  among others  has been calling for a 21st century update  But while Canada lags behind Europe in this area  it s still well ahead of the United States The political party exemption came about in part because of a parliamentary tradition of not giving bureaucrats or outside bodies control over a party s affairs  I called Michael Pal  an assistant law professor at the University of Ottawa who studies election laws and related issues like voter suppression  and asked if it s time for a change  Every other sector is covered by privacy laws but political parties   he said   They are all using data so I don t think there is a good argument about why they should be under privacy rules  As for concerns about encroaching on Parliament  Professor Pal isn t buying that either  He noted that parties were already  heavily regulated  through Elections Canada and election fund raising laws So what s a Facebook user to do now  My colleague Brian X  Chen  who writes about consumer technology  has offered some guidance on minimizing privacy risks on Facebook  although his overall take on the situation facing Facebook users is a little discouraging  What  if anything  can they do to protect their data connected to the social network  Here s the harsh truth  Not much

posts  Brian tried it and found that his  delete everything approach was probably not worth most people s time  And even after all that time  my Facebook timeline was still decorated with posts that my friends had published about me   including photos from my 21st birthday  need I say more     because that content was not mine to delete       Newsletter Sign Up     Continue reading the main story

How to Protect Yourself  and Your Friends  on FacebookRead  Want to Purge Your Social Media Timelines  Can You Spare a Few Hours Historical MomentAbout a year ago  I wrote about how the house where the Dionne quintuplets were born faced an uncertain future  The birth  and survival  of the quints at the height of the Great Depression was both a global sensation and a tale of grave injustice  The girls were taken from their family and made wards of the province of Ontario  ostensibly to protect them from exploitation  But the government turned around and exhibited almost like zoo animals  Millions of visitors viewed them from a special gallery Other injustices and misfortune followed the five through their lives  The decision by the City of North Bay to turn over the log house to a village without the obvious means to maintain or restore it looked like the latest one But much has changed in the past year  After a public campaign  North Bay reversed its decision  and the house has been moved to downtown where it will become a museum And this week  The Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada designated the birth of the quints an event of national historical significance Carlo Tarini  a friend who acts as the family s spokesman  told me this week that Annette and Cécile  the two surviving sisters  are doing well  although Cécile was hospitalized for a time in January because of pneumonia  In the pre internet decades of the 30s and 40s  the worldwide fascination they sparked as children brings shade to the Kardashian kids popularity   Mr  Tarini wrote in an email

YORK    Facebook s decision to stop working with third party data collectors might earn it public relations points  but it does little to protect your privacy  The social network still has more than enough data on your interests and hobbies to target ads with precision The company will still tap browser and device IDs to track visits to third party sites and apps  And it will have lots more information from your use of its service   everything from the businesses and hobbies you  like  to the types of news articles you read and share  The data helps Facebook create profile targets   such as college educated mothers in Detroit who like ice cream and the band Coldplay   for advertisers to reach Limiting its partnership with data brokers also doesn t touch on the difficulty Facebook has had keeping your data out of the hands of other companies  The social network is in the spotlight following accusations that a data mining firm used ill gotten data from tens of millions of Facebook users to try to influence elections Facebook may try to defuse that criticism by saying it s backing off on some data use  said Jon Reily  vice president of commerce strategy at the digital consulting

Facebook  The information includes categories like home ownership and purchase history and comes from some of the world s largest data brokers  including Acxiom  Epsilon and Experian  The decision came on the same day Facebook said it would make it easier to use its privacy controls and to see the data the company collects on its users These data brokers have troves of data on credit scores  family status  pet ownership and hobbies  which they glean from surveys  warrantee cards  retail loyalty programs and other sources  Brokers typically don t have a direct relationship with consumers  and how they get the data is often questionable  said Peter Reinhardt  CEO of Segment  a consumer data firm  Removing these brokers is a no brainer  as they add very little incremental value to

will help improve people s privacy on Facebook   But it wouldn t have stopped Cambridge Analytica from grabbing data inappropriately through an app that purported to be a research tool  Though Facebook has clamped down on apps  ability to get data on your friends  it still lets apps collect plenty of data on you  That isn t changing with Wednesday s moves And even without direct access to the brokers  data  Facebook was already able to build prediction models based on it  said Kenneth Sanford  lead analytics architect at the data science company Dataiku  So Facebook could use that model to ascertain other characteristics of people who buy Purina cat food  even if Facebook no longer gets data on which users indeed bought Purina  In the beginning  Facebook had a tremendous value in knowing those things they didn t otherwise know   Sanford said   Over time  they ve been able to accumulate that information  Besides data brokers  which will lose a source of revenue  advertisers who don t already have a lot of insights on their own customers might suffer in the short term  Debra Aho Williamson  principal analyst at the research firm eMarketer  said those advertisers might cut their spending on Facebook temporarily  but Facebook will try to shift them to its many other methods of ad targeting Losing access to purchase history could hurt some advertisers  If Purina wants to target cat lovers on Facebook  it might not know that your spouse does the actual buying   and that any advertising targeted at you might be wasted  But experts think such advertisers will just find other sources for that data to restore such insights David Ciancio  senior customer strategist at the data science specialist Dunnhumby  said the change means little more than  an extra step for advertisers   The effects on Facebook  he said  will be  relatively marginal            Advertisement  Continue reading the main story     AP Technology Writer Barbara Ortutay contributed to this

might vote The question is  How accurate are the pictures they sketch  AFFLUENT FUN SEEKER Acxiom   like its rivals   operates by gathering publicly available information from sources like the electoral roll  which gives individuals  addresses  and land registry data  which provides details on home ownership such as purchase price and if there is a mortgage on the property It also buys data from companies that conduct online surveys  as well as websites where you forgot to tick  don t share with third parties  and other sources  This data is then put into a proprietary model  which produces a list of data points and propensities  such as the likelihood a consumer might visit a betting shop Acxiom sells access to these profiles to companies that wish to target advertising at potential customers  Acxiom doesn t have a political arm like Cambridge Analytica does  but the two companies do compete for commercial customers Facebook  in the wake of the scandal over how it handles personal information  said on Wednesday it would end its partnerships with several large data brokers who help advertisers target people on the social network  Shares in Acxiom traded down more than 10 percent to  25 following Facebook s announcement The results for a single individual obviously don t tell us too much about the accuracy of a database that Acxiom says contains 47 million UK profiles and insights into 700 million consumers worldwide           Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Also  it seems I am a bad data subject since I usually opt out when asked to give companies data sharing rights  Where we have more self reported  privacy compliant data about individuals  we can be more accurate  In your case  we held very little of this data and the majority of the variables linked to you  are modelled  based on both your postcode and the household history   Acxiom said in a statement My Acxiom profile has around 750 individual data fields under a dozen categories from  household composition  to  employment   income  and  lifestyle   interests   It categorizes me as an  affluent fun seeker    The accuracy of that description depends on your definition  I suppose  but some of the information is plain wrong To start with  I m 46 years old  not 57  I won t reveal my wife s age  but I will confirm that when I got married at age 34  it wasn t to a teenager  Two children mean we re not  empty nesters   I drive a diesel car and our boiler is more than 15 years old  not less than five years as Acxiom identifies it as That could be a disappointment for the companies including Tesco supermarket  Twitter  Ford Motor Company and Facebook to whom Acxiom said it may have provided my data in the past year  Or maybe not PROFILE ERRORSThe

are the same   Hargreaves said In some potentially key areas  the data is certainly better than a random guess  It predicted that I had just a 5 2 percent probability of being self employed  rather than employed  Official data shows around 17 percent of Britons are self employed Acxiom s prediction of my household income was also much closer to the actual number than the average published by the Greater London Authority for my electoral ward  or local electoral district  the narrowest official estimate           Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  But if purchase decisions are driven by lifestyle interests  the data collected on me is of little use to marketers My predicted annual car mileage was 8 000 to 10 000 miles  based on  modelled probability   This figure echoes the 8 405 miles that car breakdown group the RAC says the average London motorist drives each year  But it s over twice my annual mileage Acxiom incorrectly says I don t have a flat screen television  something it  derived through modeling   even though a UK government report from 2013 says most households do One in seven Britons is a member of a gym  according to a 2017 industry survey  Acxiom reckons there s a 47 5 percent chance that I am interested in belonging to a gym  My last subscription expired over a decade ago Acxiom also thinks I am more likely to be interested in crossword puzzles   I haven t done one since the 1980s   than in current affairs  which has been my working life for 20 years On the positive side  there are indications Acxiom doesn t engage in racial profiling  The company predicts I have a 13 6 percent probability of interest in regularly going to a bar  I asked Hargreaves  the professor  if this seemed a statistically reasonable estimate for an Irish journalist  After she stopped laughing  Hargreaves said accurate predictions hinged on the raw data on which the profile is based BAND WAGONAcxiom said individual inaccuracies didn t undermine the value of its service  We know from working with leading brands  that data helps them deliver more accurate and relevant marketing to customers at scale    The key factor here is   at scale    it

Continue reading the main story   We adopt a test and learn approach to optimizing our campaigns   Kilner said Xiaojing Dong  associate professor of marketing and business analytics at Santa Clara University in Silicon Valley  said that qualitative predictions like those produced by Acxiom gave advertisers a much better idea of who they are reaching But Hargreaves said there was concern among some advertisers that the consumer profiles they purchase from data aggregators may not always be worth the large fees involved  Hargreaves said she is about to start working with clients of companies like Acxiom to ascertain whether they were getting value for money  Some of the data vendors are just jumping on the band wagon   she said The key to accurate profiling  experts said  was good raw data  The best is held by those companies with whom we have the deepest interactions   social media giants like Facebook or Twitter and retailers like Amazon com Stephan Lewandowsky  a professor of cognitive psychology at the University of Bristol in Britain  said that explains why companies like Cambridge Analytica would be so eager to access Facebook data  The difference between using the electoral roll and Facebook is that the information we reveal on Facebook is sufficient for a computer program to infer our personality with greater accuracy than our own spouse   he said  Reporting

"AdvertisementOpinionSupported byOp Ed ContributorFacebook Isn t Just Violating Our PrivacyImageCreditSelman DesignBy Noam CohenMarch 29  2018Even as it issues full page apologies in print newspapers promising ritualistically  to do better   Facebook and its allies have minimized the importance of the seismic revelation that the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica  which worked on behalf of the Trump campaign in 2016  had gained access to the private information of about 50 million Facebook users Some executives have pointed out that the mechanism that until a few years ago allowed a researcher with 270 000 app downloads to have access to 50 million profiles wasn t exactly a secret  and  besides  Facebook users nominally agreed to the sharing of these profiles so that apps would perform better  The company s chief security officer  Alex Stamos  took to Twitter to complain that Facebook and other  platforms  were being held to a double standard concerning the profiles  since they may well  have been criticized as monopolists for locking them down  Others poured cold water on the idea that Cambridge Analytica was able to use these profiles as grist for its research on swaying voters by cracking the code of human intention  Marc Andreessen  the venture capitalist and a Facebook board member  doesn t tweet anymore  but he  likes  hundreds of tweets a week  a group that recently included a string that mocked the public s fear that new media forms can be turned into  weapons of total mind control  Perhaps these are the wrong reasons for outrage  but that doesn t mean we shouldn t be outraged  What Facebook is selling to political campaigns is the same thing Uber is selling to its drivers and customers and what YouTube is selling to advertisers who hope to reach an audience of children   namely  the right to bypass longstanding rules and regulations in order to act with impunity When you look at the Facebook data leak scandal this way  you realize that Facebook s irresponsibility isn t merely an abuse of a personal relationship   what its chief executive  Mark Zuckerberg  called  a breach of trust between Facebook and the people who share their data with us    but also an abuse of a civic relationship Selling relief from government scrutiny of elections is a different kind of threat to the social fabric than selling relief from government scrutiny of commerce  especially in light of our country s record of denying voting rights to African Americans  Facebook can t be allowed to be a tool for enemies of democracy because it fears that regulation could hurt its bottom line What was valuable about allowing a presidential campaign to evade regulation  Well  to start  we know that Facebook  unlike a small market TV station  didn t care about Russians buying political ads  even when they paid in rubles  That s a shock to our political system  which is meant to protect against foreign interference  But more menacing is the prospect that the Trump campaign and its allies may have been given free license by Facebook to suppress African American turnout through  dark ad posts  that disappeared after viewing Shortly before the election  a senior official with the Trump campaign bragged to the Bloomberg reporters Joshua Green and Sasha Issenberg   We have three major voter suppression operations underway   which the article described as targeting  idealistic white liberals  young women  and African Americans   Brad Parscale  who ran the Trump campaign s digital advertising  is quoted in the same piece discussing his plan to use dark ad posts of an animation of Hillary Clinton referring in 1996 to some African Americans as  super predators   Parscale suggested that the campaign would use this image to discourage a demographic category described by the reporters as infrequent black voters in Florida   Only the people we want to see it  see it   he explained   It will dramatically affect her ability to turn these people out  Some of the dark Facebook ads  bought by suspected Russian fronts  have been released as part of congressional investigations into Russian meddling in the 2016 election  and these include an ad meant to depress black support for Hillary Clinton by referring to conspiracy theories involving her husband  What other dark Facebook ads might have been placed on behalf of the Trump campaign to suppress black turnout  Were there classic examples of voter suppression  like publishing the wrong Election Day date or falsely warning that you can be arrested at your polling place if you owe payment on a traffic ticket  We don t know   the dark ads have disappeared and Facebook won t release them  citing the privacy of its advertisers Facebook s vast and well designed platform offered the Trump campaign and its supporters cheap  direct access to African American voters   and along with this the chance to mislead and intimidate  In the past  candidates intent on suppressing the black vote ran up against technological barriers  They had to work with fliers and obscure radio ads  since reputable media outlets  unlike Facebook  tended to push back against racially inflammatory  untrue political advertising  Fliers and radio ads leave a public residue  too The election of 2016  the first after Barack Obama s presidency  was notable for a seven percentage point decrease in African American turnout  from 66 6 percent in 2012 to 59 6 percent  according to the Pew Research Center  This was the first decline in 20 years in a presidential election and the largest ever recorded  The 2016 turnout rate was also below even the rate for the 2004 election  when John Kerry was the Democratic candidate At a hearing with the top lawyers from Facebook  Google and Twitter about Russian meddling in the 2016 election  Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota began by emphasizing the stakes involved   I come at this with the simple idea that our democracy was formed to be self governing   she said  adding that American citizens have  a right of freedom to make their own decisions   and I think that was interfered with by Russians and also others  This simple idea of the United States as a self governing community wasn t the focus of the many mea culpa interviews Mr  Zuckerberg gave after reports of the data breach  He was focused on the individual   A lot of the most sensitive issues that we faced today are conflicts between our real values  right   he said in an interview with Recode   Freedom of speech and hate speech and offensive content  Where is the line  right  Todd A  Cox  the director of policy of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund  sees the question of our  real values  a bit differently   There has been a lot of agonizing and struggling over the place of First Amendment   he told me   I would like the discussion to turn on what role does the 14th Amendment  the Voting Rights Act  15th Amendment play    the guarantees of equal protection under the law and of the right of African Americans to vote  That is  in addition to Facebook s libertarian  Silicon Valley perspective that sees only the personal questions   my right to say what I want  my privacy   we must consider the collective questions  How do we protect historically discriminated groups  How do first we make sure everyone is able to speak through free  fair elections before we argue about what they can say This week  Facebook delayed the release of its home assistant devices and unveiled yet another attempt to make its privacy settings clear and easy to use   We ve heard loud and clear that privacy settings and other important tools are too hard to find  and that we must do more to keep people informed   Facebook s chief privacy officer  Erin Egan  and deputy general counsel  Ashlie Beringer  said in a statement announcing the new privacy system Facebook is insistent on seeing its failures as harming individuals  never society as a whole  The legal scholar Alexander Bickel was fond of saying   No answer is what the wrong question begets   Facebook has been asking the wrong question consistently for more than a decade  which is why its privacy scandals can seem like the longest running show in Silicon Valley  Recent events have offered us a chance to reframe the question about how to fix Facebook  It is one that all Americans should

caused deaths from a terrorist attack that was organized on the platform In the memo  Andrew Bosworth  a Facebook vice president  wrote   Maybe someone dies in a terrorist attack coordinated on our tools  And still we connect people  The ugly truth is that we believe in connecting people so deeply that anything that allows us to connect more people more often is  de facto  good  Mr  Bosworth and Facebook s chief executive  Mark Zuckerberg  have since disavowed the memo  which was published on Thursday by BuzzFeed News But the fallout at the Silicon Valley company has been wide  According to two Facebook employees  workers have been calling on internal message boards for a hunt to find those who leak to the media  Some have questioned whether Facebook has been transparent enough with its users and with journalists  said the employees  who asked not to be identified for fear of retaliation  Many are also concerned over what might leak next and are deleting old comments or messages that might come across as controversial or newsworthy  they said Photo                           Andrew Bosworth  a Facebook vice president  has disavowed an internal memo he wrote                                       Credit             Paul Sakuma Associated Press                     The brouhaha follows a period of intense scrutiny for Facebook and questions over what its responsibilities are to its more than 2 2 billion users  The company has been grappling this month with revelations that a British political consulting firm  Cambridge Analytica  improperly harvested data from 50 million of the social network s users  Mr  Zuckerberg has since been on an apology tour over data privacy and is expected to testify before lawmakers in Washington           Advertisement  Continue reading the main

published the memo  Mr  Bosworth deleted it from an internal message board where it had originally been posted  In a statement to BuzzFeed  Mr  Zuckerberg praised Mr  Bosworth as  a talented leader who says many provocative things  and said that he and most people at Facebook did not agree with the memo and that the company had realized that it could not just be about connecting people Facebook employees said on Friday that discussions were raging across the company regarding the merits of the post  Some called for executives to aggressively pursue action against those leaking to the media  said two Facebook employees  as well as for the company to do more to screen for potential whistle blowers during the hiring process At least one former Facebook employee  Alec Muffett  wrote on Twitter that Mr  Bosworth s memo was responsible for his decision to leave the company  Between overwork and leadership direction evidenced thusly  I could never stay   wrote Mr  Muffett  who formerly worked as a Facebook engineer                       Backplot  my  goodbye  posting to Facebook was in significant part in response to this work by  boztank  and subsequently garnered considerable

in 2015 but has since emerged as a bulwark against the Trump administration  taking a leading role in challenging the president s policies in court and trying to chip away at the Republicans  grip on state governments  Mr  Holder discussed his efforts to fight Republican gerrymandering  whether Facebook should be regulated and the potential legacy of Mr  Trump s presidency in a wide ranging TimesTalks conversation with the reporter Alexander Burns on Wednesday night in New York Here are the takeaways Trump s tweets are  the gift that keeps on giving  After the Trump administration announced this week that it would add a question about citizenship to the 2020 census  Mr  Holder said he planned to sue to block the change on behalf of the National Democratic Redistricting Committee  which he chairs  The census aims to count everyone who resides in the country  whether they are citizens or not  and Mr  Holder echoed the concerns expressed by several states this week that the citizenship question could reduce the responses from noncitizens and even legal immigrants He said his lawsuit would be aided by Mr  Trump s Twitter utterances  This is one of those incidences where I think the president s tweets and public statements will become relevant   Mr  Holder  67  said   To show the true intent   that it is not as benign as they would make it out to be  Through the words of Donald Trump and through the tweets of Donald Trump  you ll see what the true intention was of the administration  Normally  he noted  it would be difficult to argue in court that the government pushed a policy with a malicious intent  But Mr  Trump s tweets provide plenty of material for lawsuits  Mr  Holder said           Advertisement  Continue reading the main story   It is certainly the gift that keeps on giving   he said Facebook is like a communication company Mr  Holder conceded that he prefers Twitter to Facebook but occasionally catches a glimpse of Facebook when his wife signs on  But he said he had been following the recent news that a British political consulting firm  Cambridge Analytica  improperly harvested the information of 50 million Facebook users

spreading Russian backed propaganda during the presidential election  bolstered an argument for regulating Facebook  Mr  Holder said  There needs to be a certain degree of freedom   he said   We don t want to stifle the creativity that comes from those platforms  But he added   There is a way in which we have to think of these platforms as communication companies  What then does that mean in terms of how they should be regulated       Newsletter Sign Up     Continue reading the main story         Get the Morning Briefing by Email    What you need to know to start your day  delivered to your

stunned by the support Mr  Trump still enjoyed in some circles after a pornographic film star and a former Playboy model claimed they had sexual relationships with him  I find it hard to believe the conversations that we have about the conduct of this president  They are mind blowing   he said   I think to myself  You gave my guy grief because he wore a tan suit  Mr  Holder said that if the same allegations of extramarital affairs had been made against Mr  Obama or President George W  Bush  their presidencies would have been over   I just don t understand how this has not had the reaction generated that would have been generated by any other president   he said  American people need to know  the full story on C I A  interrogations Mr  Trump has nominated Mike Pompeo  the director of the C I A   to be the next secretary of state and named a veteran of the spy agency  Gina Haspel  as the next director  Both nominations require Senate confirmation  and Ms  Haspel will certainly face questions about her work as a clandestine officer in the agency s counterterrorism operations  She oversaw a secret prison in Thailand involved in the rendition  detention and interrogation of detainees           Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  In 2012  Mr  Holder effectively closed that dark chapter in the C I A  s history  announcing that a three year Justice Department investigation into brutal interrogations was ending without a prosecution  The decision outraged some liberals On Wednesday night  Mr  Holder said that Ms  Haspel would have to answer tough questions   and that the public deserved to know more about the country s enhanced interrogation program  He said that parts of the Justice Department report and a separate Senate investigation into the program should be declassified  The American people need to know exactly what happened during that time period   he said  We have to do something  about gun violence Responding to recent calls for a repeal of the Second Amendment  Mr  Holder said such an effort was impracticable but offered four suggestions to address what he called a  gun violence epidemic in the United States   His remarks came days after John Paul Stevens  a retired associate justice of the United States Supreme Court  wrote an Op Ed in The Times advocating repeal Assault weapons should be banned  as well as higher capacity magazines  Mr  Holder said  Background checks should be expanded for prospective gun buyers  and the government should reinstate the funding of studies on gun violence by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  Compare us to any other nation  and we are just off the charts when it comes to mass shootings and the number of people killed through the use of firearms   Mr  Holder said   We have to do something about it          Continue reading the main story                                 We re interested in your feedback on this page  Tell us what you think

their employees in an all staff meeting broadcast around the world  There is a lot of fear within Google   said Sundar Pichai  the company s chief executive  according to a video of the meeting viewed by The New York Times  When asked by an employee if there was any silver lining to Mr  Trump s election  the Google co founder Sergey Brin said   Boy  that s a really tough one right now   Ruth Porat  the finance chief  said Mr  Trump s victory felt  like a ton of bricks dropped on my chest   Then she instructed members of the audience to hug the person next to them Sixteen months later  Google s parent company  Alphabet  has most likely saved billions of dollars in taxes on its overseas cash under a new tax law signed by Mr  Trump  Alphabet also stands to benefit from the Trump administration s looser regulations for self driving cars and delivery drones  as well as from proposed changes to the trade pact with Mexico and Canada that would limit Google s liability for user content on its sites Once one of Mr  Trump s most vocal opponents  Silicon Valley s technology industry has increasingly found common ground with the White House  When Mr  Trump was elected  tech executives were largely up in arms over a leader who espoused policies on immigration and other issues that were antithetical to their companies  values  Now  many of the industry s executives are growing more comfortable with the president and how his economic agenda furthers their business interests  even as many of their employees continue to disagree with Mr  Trump on social issues

benefited from the Trump administration s policies Those include lowering corporate taxes  encouraging development of new wireless technology like 5G and  so far  ignoring calls to break up the tech giants  Mr  Trump s tougher stance on China may also help ward off industry rivals  with the president squashing a hostile bid to acquire the chip maker Qualcomm this month  And Mr  Trump let die an Obama era rule that required many tech start ups to give some workers more overtime pay Mr  Trump  has been great for business and really  really good for tech   said Gary Shapiro  who leads the Consumer Technology Association  the largest American tech trade group  with more than 2 200 members including Apple  Google  Amazon and Facebook Mr  Shapiro said that he had voted for Hillary Clinton  Mr  Trump s opponent  in 2016  but that he and many tech executives had come around on Mr  Trump  While they disagree with him on immigration and the environment  they have found areas where their

mean we cannot work together in others   Mr  Shapiro said   Everyone who is married knows that  Mr  Trump himself has taken to naming tech companies he says are on his side After Apple took advantage of the new tax law in January to bring back most of the  252 billion cash hoard that it had parked overseas  the company said it would make a  350 billion  contribution to the U S  economy  over the next five years  That prompted Mr  Trump to suggest he had made good on a campaign pledge to get Apple to bring jobs back to the United States  You know  for  350 million  you could build a beautiful plant  But for  350 billion  they re going to build a lot of plants   the president told members of Congress last month  Mr  Trump said he had called Timothy D  Cook  Apple s chief executive  to

Information Technology Industry Council  a 102 year old advocacy group that represents the biggest tech firms  said his members walked a tightrope  supporting and opposing the president on different issues  Lately  he said   we have reached balance in the tightrope  The equilibrium marks a turnabout from what had been a testy relationship between Mr  Trump and the tech sector  On the campaign

in the Paris climate accords  In November  Microsoft sued the administration to protect a law that blocks deportation of young undocumented immigrants known as Dreamers  More than 100 companies  including Google  Facebook and Uber  filed a brief supporting California s lawsuit on that issue Even so  tech executives worked to build a relationship with the president  with some meeting him at Trump Tower before his inauguration and again at the White House in June  While in Washington for the second meeting  Mr  Cook and Satya Nadella  Microsoft s chief executive  also dined with Jared

Privacy was deemed obsolete  like bloodletting and milkmen Now  the consumer surveillance model underlying Facebook and Google s free services is under siege from users  regulators and legislators on both sides of the Atlantic  It amounts to a crisis for an internet industry that up until now had taken a reactive  whack a mole approach to problems like the spread of fraudulent news and misuse of

privacy settings allowed access to too much data The greatest likelihood is that the internet companies  frightened by the tumult  will accept a few more rules and work a little harder for

ad targeting  describing its services in a company case study as  influencing voters   People are upset that their data may have been used to secretly influence 2016 voters   said Alessandro Acquisti  a professor of information technology and public policy at Carnegie Mellon University   If your personal information can help sway elections  which affects everyone s life and societal well being  maybe privacy does matter after all  In interviews  Mr  Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg  Facebook s chief operating officer  seemed to accept the possibility of increased privacy regulation  something that would have been unlikely only a few months ago  But some trade group executives also warned that any attempt to curb the use of consumer data would put the business model of the ad supported internet at risk Photo                           Facebook has worked directly with presidential campaigns on ad targeting  once describing its services as  influencing voters                         You re undermining a fundamental concept in advertising  reaching consumers who are interested in a particular product   said Dean C  Garfield  chief executive of the Information Technology Industry Council  a trade group in Washington whose members include Amazon  Facebook  Google and Twitter If suspicion of Facebook and Google is a relatively new feeling in the United States  it has been embedded in Europe for historical and cultural reasons that date back to the Nazi Gestapo  the Soviet occupation of Eastern Europe and the Cold War  We re at an inflection point  when the great wave of optimism about tech is giving way to growing alarm   said Heather Grabbe  director of the Open Society European Policy Institute   This is the moment when Europeans turn to the state for protection and answers  and are less likely than Americans to rely on the market to sort out imbalances  In May  the European Union is instituting a comprehensive new privacy law  called the General Data Protection Regulation  The new rules treat personal data as proprietary  owned by an individual  and any use of that data must be accompanied by permission   opting in rather than opting out   after receiving a request written in clear language  not legalese Mélanie Voin  a spokeswoman for the European Commission  said the protection rules will have more teeth than the current 1995 directive  For example  a company experiencing a data breach involving individuals must notify the data protection authority within 72 hours and would be subject to fines of up to 20 million euros or 4 percent of its annual revenue Photo                           Users detailed their interests and obsessions on Facebook and Google  generating a river of data that could be collected and harnessed for advertising                                       Credit             Sergio Perez Reuters                     In a January speech in Brussels  Facebook s Ms  Sandberg said   We know we can t just meet the G D P R   but we need to do even more   Google declined to comment           Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  The United States does not have a consumer privacy law like the General Data Protection Regulation  But after years of pushing for similar legislation  privacy groups said that recent events were giving them new momentum   and they were looking to Europe for inspiration  With the new European law  regulators for the first time have real enforcement tools   said Jeffrey Chester  the executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy  a nonprofit group in Washington   We now have a way to hold these companies accountable  But any ambitions for new rules may run into the realities of the tech industry Privacy advocates and even some United States regulators have long been concerned about the ability of online services to track consumers and make inferences about their financial status  health concerns and other intimate details to show them behavior based ads  They warned that such microtargeting could unfairly categorize or exclude certain people In 2010  for instance  the Federal Trade Commission proposed a new option for consumers  called Do Not Track  Two years later  the Barack Obama administration introduced a blueprint for a Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights  intended to give Americans more control over what personal details companies collected from them and how the data was used      Newsletter Sign Up     Continue reading the main story         Interested in All Things Tech     The Bits newsletter will keep you updated on the latest from

personal details posed no harm to consumers and that efforts to hinder data collection would chill innovation  Instead  the advertising industry created a program to allow consumers to opt out of having their data used for customized ads  although it does not allow people to entirely opt out of having their data collected  If it can be shown that the current situation is actually a market failure and not an individual company failure  then there s a case to be made for federal regulation  under certain circumstances  said Randall Rothenberg  chief executive of the Interactive Advertising Bureau  a trade group The business practices of Facebook and Google were reinforced by the fact that no privacy flap lasted longer than a news cycle or two  Nor did people flee for other services  That convinced the companies that digital privacy was a dead issue           Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  If the current furor dies down without meaningful change  critics worry that the problems might become even more entrenched  When the tech industry follows its natural impulses  it becomes even less transparent That would hamper any long term understanding of the relationship between social media and political views  an urgent question in Germany  Myanmar  Sri Lanka  the United States and many other places  To know the real interaction between populism and Facebook  you need to give much more access to researchers  not less   said Paul Jasper Dittrich  a German research fellow in digital economy at the Jacques Delors Institute   There s another reason Silicon Valley tends to be reluctant to share information about what it is doing  It believes so deeply in itself that it does not even think there is a need for discussion  The technology world s remedy for any problem is always more technology  If Facebook and Google were merely interested in maximizing profits  we could regulate them   said Maciej Ceglowski  who runs Tech Solidarity  a labor

children say  shooketh One short week ago  Season 3 of  RuPaul s Drag Race All Stars  ended not with a bang but a limper  as Shangela  the leader in the polls  was thrown under the hot rod by an extralegally installed electoral body ody ody of her competitors  clearing the strip for the perfectly lovely but somewhat uninspired Trixie Mattel to hobble across the finish line   I look forward to Shangela s book   What Had Happened Was    The herstoric halls were left a disappointing  tepid mess Fortunately  an especially fierce 14 queen crew arrived Thursday night ready to clean up  Brooms  rubber gloves and sponges swept the workroom and the runway in a season premiere dedicated to celebrating the show s decaversary by unearthing and dusting off the gritty roots of drag  The past and the episode blasted open with Ru parroting the drag ball M C  Junior Labeija s iconic bark   Tens  tens  tens across the board  Thankfully not limping was the resurgent Eureka  prematurely ejected

Broadway queen  Blair St  Clair played the coveted role of Star to Be with the aria   Just got here this morning   She is precious  if perhaps a bit out of her depth  I m just glad she made it from

broom  to sweep up the competition  girl   The Hollywood diva Mayhem Miller  who has auditioned  year after year after year   finally arrived in full Dreamgirls eleganza  and did not wait until eleven o clock to tell us that she is not going Chicago s The Vixen  looking like a drained Sears Tower souvenir snow globe  took a boxer s stance and announced   I m just here to fight   Is she already positioning herself to be the villain  Why do people still do that  Do villains ever win reality competitions The first mini challenge was a classic ball walk down the runway  which was rimmed with

queen Dusty Ray Bottoms  her face trademark punctuated with every period orphaned by her generation s texts  said   I was really  really  really trying to spot the booger  but everyone looks  expletive  fierce   It was an unfortunate metaphor  but it did articulate what we were thinking  This clutch of queens seems unusually strong  and it s hard to imagine who will be eliminated The maxi challenge  a remix of the first challenge from the show s first episode   Drag on a Dime   took us back to the beginnings of both the show and the scrappy art of drag itself  The Pit Crew wheeled in a 99 cent store s worth of pool noodles  dish sponges and assorted capitalist effluvia  from which the queens cobbled together an impressive array of looks and hit the runway Before the judging  Ru announced that another queen would be returning   No  it wasn t Shangela  She s walking in the woods   The competitors visibly blanched as Ru introduced the Season 9 contestant Farrah Moan   who was quickly Ru vealed to actually be Farrah s doppelgänger  the guest judge Christina Aguilera  Ms  Aguilera did a quick bit that reminded us why  Burlesque  was her last notable acting job  then pulled out a hand held mic from seemingly nowhere and did a quick melismatic run  The queens swooned Mayhem  who crafted a cigarette girl ensemble out of latex gloves and trash bags  leaked tears when she was named the winner of the challenge  The judge and national treasure Ross Mathews soothed and encouraged her by saying   This is your time   I paid my therapist  200 an hour to tell me that when my husband left me  so  Mayhem  consider that money in your bank  Invest in Cambridge Analytica The bottom two were Kalorie  correctly called on the carpet for her  million dollar dress  of generic Monopoly money hot glued to an ill fitting bustier  a fourth removed cousin of superior cash fronted gowns of queens past   and Vanessa  spatchcocked by Michelle Visage for her definition deficient  doll festooned silk flower leotard    It s literally a head and legs  and the rest is flowers   Michelle hissed  somehow turning into an insult the exact phrase I ve always dreamed a man would use to describe my body   They were ordered to lip sync for their lives to Ms  Aguilera s  Ain t No Other Man  Kalorie described herself as  the twerking queen   and she is not wrong  In a coup de grâce  she pulled a fistful of dollar bills from her bustier and made it rain on herself Vanessa s lip sync was a bit wan in comparison  and she was  sadly  the first bat to be plucked from the renovated cave  She bravely fought back tears as she sashayed away   I hope this isn t the last we see of her Ru declared at the top of the episode that the mission of  Drag Race  is to take over the world  and 10 years in  his coup seems to be just about complete  The show s stars have millions of fans and fill performance halls in red states  with teenage girls cosplaying as their favorite queens  RuPaul has built a juggernaut on the wigs of queens old enough not just to be this season s drag mothers  but their birth mothers           Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  But with great power comes great Ru sponsibility  Drag is currently a cultural Bitcoin  and it seems that in its peaking moment  it will either permanently tuck itself into the mainstream or pop back into the bubbles  Heavy will be the head that eventually wears this season s crown  But this crop of girls seems especially fun and smart  with good wigs on their padded shoulders  and I trust that one of them will responsibly lead us to the midterms  I look forward to spending my spring in their company   Will Eureka make it through this season on both feet  Will The Vixen collude with a group of Russian drag queens and take the crown in an upset  Will a remake of  Burlesque  starring Farrah Moan and Cher alike All Star Chad Michaels finally be greenlit See you next week         Continue reading the main

Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Mr  Trump s criticisms  though  are largely mistaken  For a long time  Amazon did not pay state sales tax  but it does so now when it sells its own goods in states that collect it  It is the case  however  that in most states Amazon does not collect sales taxes on goods sold by third parties through its platform  As for the United States Postal Service  Amazon s business appears to be giving a welcome lift to its package shipping revenue         Continue reading the main story                                Advertisement  Continue reading the main story                      Still  Amazon cannot quietly hope that such criticism just fades away  Amazon s rapid growth  immense bargaining power  eye catching initiatives and estimated 44 percent share of U S  e commerce sales make the company vulnerable to accusations that it is too powerful But if the Trump administration pursues ways to curtail the company  it would meet sizable obstacles Amazon accounts for only 4 percent of all retail sales in the United States  a recent survey estimated  Its revenue is a third of Walmart s and  even after its acquisition of Whole Foods  Amazon s footing in the grocery business is still small All in all  it would be hard to show that Amazon is pushing prices higher for consumers Amazon also has a loyal customer base   it has an estimated 90 million Prime members   and the public views it relatively favorably  When the Department of Justice s antitrust lawyers went after the proposed merger of Time Warner and AT T  it was not targeting companies that were particularly popular with the public Still  some Amazon critics see a possible  though small  opening  In theory  an antitrust case could focus on the firms that supply Amazon with goods  according to Christopher L  Sagers  a law professor at Cleveland State University  If a company consistently uses its power to demand a good from suppliers at too low a price  the public could still get hurt  That s because the supply of the good could decline  its quality degrade  and there may be less innovation in the sector that produces the good  Mr  Sagers said But anyone bringing that against Amazon would have to explain why Walmart would not be a target  too   Peter EavisPhoto                                        Credit             Jim Wilson   New York Times                      Public pension fund wants changes to Facebook s board The investment adviser to New York City s pension funds is calling for changes to Facebook s board to address the fallout from Cambridge Analytica s improper harvesting of information from 50 million users of the social network           Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  New York City s comptroller  Scott M  Stringer  wrote in a letter addressed to Dr  Susan Desmond Hellmann  an independent director at Facebook and the chief executive of the Bill   Melinda Gates Foundation  Facebook is now among the most valuable and  given the immense power and reach of its platform  most influential companies in the world  The very data collection and sharing practices that made its extraordinary growth possible  and that are the basis of the company s business model  are now facing potential regulation in numerous jurisdictions around the world  New York City s pension funds  which have more than  193 billion in assets under management  own  895 million of Facebook s shares  according to the letter  Even with the recent tumble in its shares  Facebook is valued at more than  450 billion In his letter  Mr  Stringer calls on Facebook s independent directors to take four steps to help restore investor confidence Here are the proposed changes 1  Add at least three new independent directors to improve the board s ability to oversee the evolving risks Facebook faces 2  Name an independent director as chairman  allowing Mark Zuckerberg  Facebook s chief executive and chairman  to focus on running the company 3  Create a committee of independent directors to oversee the company s data privacy policies and risks 4  Institute a clawback policy so that the board can  recoup executive pay in the event of violations of law  regulation or company policy  Photo                                        Credit             Paulo Whitaker Reuters                     Trump tweets Amazon does not pay enough

commentary  made in a Twitter post  comes amid reports that Mr  Trump has expressed an interest in reining in the e commerce business           Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Amazon and the company s founder  Jeff Bezos  are among Mr  Trump s regular Twitter targets  In December  Mr  Trump questioned whether the United States Post Office charges Amazon enough for package deliveries  And in August  Mr  Trump said Amazon hurts taxpaying businesses Amazon  however  does pay taxes    412 million in 2016  for instance  according to the company s report to the Securities and Exchange Commission Axios reported on Wednesday that Mr  Trump has wondered aloud whether Amazon could be vulnerable to antitrust or competition laws  Trump s wealthy friends tell him Amazon is destroying their businesses  His real estate buddies tell him   and he agrees   that Amazon is killing shopping malls and brick and mortar retailers  Amazon shares fell more than 7 percent following that Axios article but recovered some of those losses after a White House official told Reuters that the company faced no particular policy changes  But the administration is always looking at its options  the official added  The stock closed down 4 4 percent Wednesday Shares were down nearly 2 percent in early trading Should shareholders worry  The GBH Insights analyst Daniel Ives told Bloomberg that this regulatory threat was unlikely to change Amazon s business model  but it was still  the last thing nervous tech investors wanted to see today  Retailers  at least  already have some reason to be cheerful And Amazon has another target market for expansion  housekeeping First quarter profits are going to be big Corporate American will start reporting first quarter results in less than two weeks  and earnings are expected to be big Analysts estimate that profits at companies in the S  P  500 grew 17 3 percent this quarter  according to FactSet  If the forecasts prove accurate that would be highest earnings growth rate since the first quarter of 2011           Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Perhaps most surprising  is that analysts have grown more optimistic on corporate earnings as the quarter progressed  The earnings forecast for the index rose 5 4 percent from the start of the quarter to the end  Typically  analysts lower their expectations as the quarter progresses  On average  the profit estimates for the index fall 3 7 percent from the start of the quarter to the end But there are reasons for investors to temper their enthusiasm  Analysts have not been as optimistic about the abilities of companies to increase sales  Revenue is expected to have grown 7 3 percent in the first quarter  up from a 7 percent rate at the start of the quarter That suggests analysts are not raising estimates because of increased sales  So why are they  Taxes  And the impact tax reform will have on bottom lines should moderate in the coming quarters That may already be happening  BofA Merrill Lynch s earnings revision ratio for the S  P  500 fell in March for the first time in three months  Of course  the pullback comes after the ratio hits the highest level on record in February  but it does suggest that earnings lift from tax reform has begun to wane Photo                                        Credit             Emmanuel Dunand Agence France Presse   Getty Images                     Are we witnessing the end of a tech boom Investors  always willing to believe in technology companies  spent the last three years piling into their shares with abandon  Now the intellectual underpinnings of that rally are being tested Exhibit A  Facebook  down 20 percent from its recent high Exhibit B  Nvidia  off 12 percent from its recent high Exhibit C  Tesla  not a tech stock but in the FANG  index Concerns about Tesla s ability to fund itself can also be seen in the trading of its debt The WSJ s Charley Grant explains Tesla can t simply cut spending to solve its cash challenge if it hopes to ramp up production  The company has racked up about  10 billion in long term debt and has  23 billion in total liabilities  To survive long term  Tesla needs to stop overpromising and to scale back its ambitions to goals it actually can achieve  Right now  though  it just needs more money Peter Eavis notes that the latest problems for tech giants have raised deeper doubts After the Uber incident in Arizona  those companies may take a more realistic look at what they have to spend to create a technology that is efficient and safe  and conclude that they have to pull out of the race or pare back  Users of social media and regulators may prevent social media companies from sharing so much of their data with advertisers  and that could restrain revenue growth  And if the passion for two or three big tech companies wanes  the cooling may spread Photo                                        Credit             Dado Ruvic

intimidate you  if he wants to  or charm you  if he chooses  Because he is a taskmaster and a visionary and a billionaire  people in Hollywood and Silicon Valley pay close attention when he speaks He has so many vests from Herb Allen s Sun Valley retreats for global elites that they re taking over his closets  There is so much fleece   says the chairman of IAC  laughing   I ve been going for 30 years  On this rainy afternoon  by the fireplace in the Frank Lloyd Wright inspired stone and wood living room of his dreamy mansion  Mr  Diller is all charm  with a healthy dose of self deprecation

we are hopscotching topics  from Silicon Valley taking over Hollywood to Jared   Ivanka   Josh   Karlie to pornography to his company s dating websites to the time Harvey Weinstein tried to throw Mr  Diller off a balcony in Cannes to how his friend Hillary Clinton is faring to the mogul s dismissal of Donald Trump  whose Secret Service code name is Mogul  as  a joke  and  evil  I tell him that a friend of mine  an executive in network television  fretfully asked her Hollywood psychic how long Mr  Trump would last as president and the psychic asserted that it wouldn t be more than two years and that the president would be felled by a three page email   The only problem with this prediction being  I don t think Mr  Trump emails   I would so love it if he were being blackmailed by Putin   Mr  Diller says with a sly smile   That would make me very happy  This was a man of bad character from the moment he entered adulthood  if not before  Pure  bad character  Ugh  Trump  Photo

who lost a fortune on Newsweek and Daily Beast  only writes badly about me  He is a sad and pathetic figure  Lives lie  Mr  Diller waves off talk of Mr  Trump opening the door to more celebrity

main story  Has the media gone overboard in criticizing Mr  Trump  Are you kidding   he replies Mr  Diller says that he and his wife  Diane von Furstenberg  are friends with Josh Kushner and his supermodel girlfriend  Karlie Kloss  but do not hang out with Jared and Ivanka He has put Chelsea Clinton on the boards of two of his companies  but that is not likely to happen with this first daughter  I mean  we were friendly   he says of Ivanka  in the time before Mr  Trump became president   I would sit next to her every once in a while at a dinner  And I  as everyone did  was like   Oh  my God  how could this evil character have spawned such a polite  gracious person   I don t think we feel that way now  At 76  having seen around the corner to tech and pulled together the ragtag group of internet ventures at IAC into a thriving whole  Mr  Diller has  mellowed beautifully   as one producer here who has known him for many years puts it His dogs are jumping up on our chairs  He has three Jack Russell terriers cloned from his late  beloved dog Shannon  a Gaelic orphan he found wandering many years ago on a back road in Ireland For about  100 000  a South Korean firm  reincarnated  Shannon in three pups  Tess  short for  test tube   and DiNA  a play on DNA  who live in Beverly Hills  and Evita  who lives in Cloudwalk  the Connecticut home of Mr  Diller and Ms  von Furstenberg  These dogs  they re the soul of Shannon   he says   Diane was horrified that I was doing this but she s switched now to say   Thank God you did   Mr  Diller has started a trend in Hollywood  inspiring his friend Barbra Streisand  desolate over the loss of her Coton de Tulear  Samantha  to clone her           Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Doesn t he want to clone himself into a  Killer Diller   as his protégés  including Jeffrey Katzenberg  Michael Eisner and Uber s Dara Khosrowshahi  are known  God forbid   he says with a grimace From Mailroom to  MeToo MaelstromI ask Mr  Diller what he thought of Sacha Baron Cohen s joke at David Geffen s recent birthday party at Jimmy Iovine s house in Los Angeles that Mr  Geffen  Mr  Diller and the other starry billionaires and millionaires there represented  the world s third largest economy   It is a funny joke   he says   It s close to true  Is it a cool club to be in  I wonder  or a back stabbing one  For me  it s stimulating   he says   Diane hates it  So I am both in it  because I like it  and ripped out of it  because Diane says   Too much money  too many rich people  let s go   I ve got a good personal boomerang process  He says he met Mr  Geffen  whom he considers  family   when the two were teenagers in the William Morris mailroom in Los Angeles  It s Christmastime and this scrawny person comes into the mailroom and he said   I m in the mailroom at William Morris in New York  I had a week off for the holiday so I wanted to come and work here   And I thought  Oh  my God  on your vacation   Because for me  vacation was Hawaii  We talk about how Hollywood has changed  and I ask how the  MeToo era will affect the content of movies   Red Sparrow  has some of the most violent and extreme sexual messiness that you could imagine   he says   O K   it was made a year and a half ago  Would it be made today in the same way  Probably so  So I don t think it affects content           Advertisement  Continue reading the main story   I mean  if you take the effect of pornography on young people today  Pornography until recently was fairly staid  Today  online  pornography is so extreme and so varied  with such expressions of fetishism and other things that boys are seeing  The idea of normal sex and normal romance has to be adversely affected by that  Photo                                        Credit             Harry Eelman for The New York Times                     Once  Hollywood taught us about desire and sex and romance  giving us a vocabulary for these experiences  But no more  I wonder what will happen as girls emboldened by the fall of male predators collide with boys indoctrinated by pornography  I see it in our companies  where the relationships between people are changing   Mr  Diller says   We recently had a formal complaint made by a woman who said that she was at a convention with her colleagues and she was asked to have a drink with her boss  Period  That was the complaint  And we said   Here s the thing  Anybody can ask you anything  other than let s presume something illegal  and you have the right to say  Yes  or  No   If it s  Yes   go in good health and if it s  No   then it s full stop   But the end result of that is a guy  let s presume he is heterosexual  and his boss  heterosexual  and guy asks guy for a drink and they go have a drink and they talk about career opportunities  And the boss says   Oh  this is a smart guy  I m promoting him   A woman now cannot be in that position  So all these things are a changin   God knows  I m hardly a sociologist  But I hope in the future for some form of reconciliation  Because I think all men are guilty  I m not talking about rape and pillage  I m not talking about Harveyesque  I m talking about all of the spectrum  From an aggressive flirt  Or even just a flirty flirt that has one sour note in it  Or what I think every man was guilty of  some form of omission in attitude  in his views  Are we really going to have only capital punishment  Because right now  that s what we have  You get accused  you re obliterated  Charlie Rose ceases to exist  Twilight of the GodsMr  Diller is the chairman of the board of Expedia  and his IAC owns a gaggle of internet properties  including Vimeo  Dictionary com  Investopedia  Tinder  Match and OkCupid  I wonder how he thinks online dating is reshaping the culture  It s just like the princess phone evolved to the internet   he says   Match com has caused God knows how many more marriages than bars ever did  And now I m starting to hear that out of Tinder  It s funny  though  on Bumble  the women get to choose first and they don t want to  I liked the sheer adventure of romance before online dating  which is less appealing to me  I ask Mr  Diller  a Los Angeles native  about a comment made to me by the playwright and TV writer Jon Robin Baitz  another Los Angeles native  that Hollywood is no longer relevant politically and culturally           Advertisement  Continue reading the main story   Does Hollywood reflect in any possible sense what is happening in the world   Mr  Baitz asked   Hollywood abdicated films and became an empty exercise in male capes and superheroes  Can you imagine anyone now making  Norma Rae    Silkwood    Five Easy Pieces    Reds   Since Mr  Diller was running Paramount in 1981 when Warren Beatty and Diane Keaton made Mr  Beatty s epic  Reds   he should know  What an undertaking   Mr  Diller says   But isn t it amazing how it holds  Calling  Red Sparrow   awful  and  The Shape of Water   beautiful but silly   he says he wouldn t want to run a movie studio now   It would be like saying  do I want to own a horse and buggy company  The idea of a movie is losing its meaning  Of the Academy Awards nominees this year  he said   essentially  no one went to see them  Growing up in Beverly Hills with a father in the construction business   he says there are still streets out here named  Dillerdale  and  Barrydale    Mr  Diller was able to see the twilight of the men who invented Hollywood  They were real characters   overblown  exuberant  nasty  but each of them in their own way were genuinely interesting people   he says   The only thing that I ve learned  that I think I ve had some instinct for  is instinct  And these people operated completely out of instinct  As against today  when people operate out of research and marketing  He says that Netflix and Amazon have blasted Hollywood into  a completely different universe   It s something that s never happened in media before  when Netflix got a lot of subscribers early on and made the brilliant decision to pour it into original production  like spending more than  100 million dollars to make  House of Cards   instead of buying old stuff   he says   It blows my mind  It s like a giant vacuum cleaner came and pushed all the other vacuum cleaners aside  And they cannot be outbid  No one can compete with them  He calls Reed Hastings  the C E O  of Netflix  the most remarkable person in the media business   He has so much original thinking in so many different areas  he s really impressive  I ask how the tech community s noxious bro culture will affect the business here  given that Hollywood already has such entrenched sexism           Advertisement  Continue reading the main story   They re tech people   he says with a shrug   They don t have a lot of romance in them  They don t have a lot of nuance in them  Their lives are ones and zeros   But they can grow  he says   When I met Bill Gates  I would say he had the emotional quotient of a snail  And now you can see him cry  He corrects me when I call the tech titans our overlords   Our overlords are not them   he says   Our overlords are artificial intelligence  At several points during our three hour interview  Mr  Diller stops to ask me if this is any fun  When I assure him it s fascinating  he looks skeptical  Yeah  right   he says   Don t seduce me  I m a very seducible person   He also says he s a  jinxable  person      Newsletter Sign Up     Continue reading the main story         Of the Moment    The

years ago   What I found so incredibly appealing is that behind the very forceful  determined and engaged human being  there was shyness and reservation  He s not a pig  I mean  in no way  He impressed her immediately on a trip to Vegas by driving his banana yellow Jaguar E Type sports car barefoot and talking a policeman out of giving him a speeding ticket On another occasion  driving back into Manhattan fast from her Connecticut house   Mr  Diller likes to drive fast   they saw an octogenarian couple crossing the street slowly  holding on to each other  Both of us at the same time thought exactly the same thing   One day  we will be that couple    she recalls   The only thing we disagree on is  he thinks it was Madison Avenue and I say it was Lexington            Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  The other quality his friends talk about is his voracious curiosity  When he knows about something  he knows more about it than anyone else  and when he doesn t know something  he wants to know more about it than anybody else   says Scott Rudin  who has produced movies  plays and television with Mr  Diller  including  Lady Bird  for the screen and  Betrayal    The Humans    A Doll s House  Part 2    Three Tall Women  and  Carousel  for Broadway   Mr  Rudin is also helping his friend develop the so called Diller Island  an undulating pier floating on piles in the Hudson River adjacent to the meatpacking district Given that Mr  Diller helped create the Fox Broadcasting Company with Rupert Murdoch   and blessedly greenlighted  The Simpsons    I wonder if he feels like Dr  Frankenstein  I left Fox before Fox News came into being   he says  About the sale of Fox to Disney  he notes that his former boss  played a bad hand very well  I observe that he called Harvey Weinstein out publicly as a bully early on Mr  Diller recalls that once in Cannes  when he was the chief executive of Universal  Stacey Snider  the head of the movie division  told him that  Harvey had treated her terribly and made her cry  So the next day I saw Harvey on the terrace at Hotel du Cap and I said   Harvey  don t ever treat an executive at my company that way  Don t you ever talk to anyone in that manner   And Harvey  about six feet away  said   I m going to throw you off the terrace   And this gorilla  because he looks like a gorilla  starts walking towards me  right  And truly  I was scared  I thought  how  without cutting and running like a chicken  do I stop him  And somehow a bear came into my mind   He says he pulled himself up into a menacing stance  as you re supposed to do if you have to confront a bear  And it so surprised him that he stopped and I got out with a small amount of honor   he says  Ms  Snider told Kim Masters in a 2007 Esquire article that Mr  Diller was such a tough boss that she teared up with him  after she made a blunder at a meeting  Mr  Diller apologized to her afterward  He adds   Other than psychopaths  I think all of this bad behavior is finished  Speaking of bad behavior  I ask if he knew Mr  Trump back in the day in Manhattan He said that when he was in his mid 30s  running Paramount  Mr  Trump invited him to lunch  And you know when people compliment you without foundation   Mr  Diller says   And they do it too much  It s really irritating  It s kind of offensive  And he spent the entire time saying how great I was  He didn t know me  And afterward  I walked around the corner and I thought   I never want to see that man again   Decades passed and we would run into each other  but I literally never spoke to him again            Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  He says he has gone to a couple of Broadway shows recently with Hillary Clinton and that  she s well with herself again and she has a role to play  After the interview  when the Cambridge Analytica scandal breaks  I call him to see what he makes of Facebook s role  Since the beginning of media and advertising  the holy grail has been the precise targeting of the ads   he says   Along comes the internet with almost perfect aim  and now the entire concept is being called antisocial  That s a most ironic but momentous thing  Mr  Diller s friends say he is quiet about his philanthropy  He flinches when I use the term  Diller Island   saying it should be called  Pier 55  Now he is working on an idea concocted by Alex von Furstenberg  Diane s son whom Mr  Diller also calls his son  to build a gondola up to the Hollywood sign and a circular catwalk around it  so that people can tour and hike around it He is very proud of the success of the High Line  the elevated park he helped fund on the West Side of Manhattan   Who would have dreamed so many people would come   he marvels Andrew M  Cuomo  the governor of New York  pulled the Hudson Island project  a  250 million family park and cultural center  out of the ashes  moving past attempts by Douglas Durst to block it   Hasn t that family done enough damage   The delay cost us  25 million or something like that   Mr  Diller says   But here s the thing  My family s lucky  So who s counting  Can I actually say   Who s counting   That s awful  But it s true  There s a lot about the absurdity of wealth  I have so many friends who continue to make absurd amounts of money and count it  I think if you re really lucky  who s counting  MORE  Barry Diller
