"LONDON    A former Cambridge Analytica political consultant said the company s management misled the British public about work the firm did for a pro Brexit group before the vote to leave the European Union  the Guardian reported on Friday Brittany Kaiser  a business development director at the company from 2014 until earlier this year  said in an interview that Cambridge Analytica was carrying out data crunching and analysis work for Leave EU  while publicly denying it was doing so The insider account puts further pressure on the London based data analytics firm  which is already facing renewed scrutiny in the United States and Europe over allegations it improperly harvested Facebook data to target U S  voters Late on Friday  a High Court judge granted an application by the UK Information Commissioner s Office for a warrant to search Cambridge Analytica s offices The data protection watchdog said in a statement it plans to execute the warrant shortly to confirm the company deleted data from 50 million Facebook profiles  which a whistleblower has alleged it failed to do Kaiser  who acted as a spokeswoman for Cambridge Analytica before and after the 2016 referendum  said she was ordered by the company to deny the firm was involved with the Brexit issue  I was quite confident that real work was being undertaken   Kaiser said in a videotaped interview with the Guardian  No  we didn t run the whole campaign and maybe our work wasn t used  but when I talked to the press we were actually undertaking data work and analysis  for Leave EU  she said Last month  Cambridge Analytica Chief Executive Alexander Nix denied to a parliamentary committee the company worked for Leave EU  saying only that his firm had met the campaign group to discuss potential business  but did not reach a deal  Let me be absolutely crystal clear about this  I do not know how many ways I can say this  We did not work for Leave EU  We have not undertaken any paid or unpaid work for them  okay   he told a committee investigating fake news in UK politics Cambridge Analytica s board of directors suspended Nix on Tuesday shortly before British broadcaster Channel 4 aired an expose of the firm s business practices in the United States Arron Banks  a major donor to Leave EU  wrote in  The Bad Boys of Brexit  a campaign diary he published after the campaign that the group had hired Cambridge Analytica on Oct  22  2015 to use  big data and advanced psychographics to influence people   Reporting by Eric Auchard in London  Editing by Adrian Croft "
"Debates over privacy have plagued Facebook for years But the news that  Cambridge Analytica  a political data firm that worked on President Trump s 2016 campaign  was able to gain access to private data through the social network has sparked an unusually strong reaction among its users The hashtag  DeleteFacebook appeared more than 10 000 times on Twitter within a two hour period on Wednesday  according to the analytics service ExportTweet  On Tuesday  it was mentioned 40 398 times  according to the analytics service Digimind Cher was one such deserter  writing on Twitter that the decision to quit Facebook  although  very hard   was necessary because she loves the United States Brian Acton  a co founder of the WhatsApp messaging service  told his tens of thousands of followers on Tuesday to delete Facebook  The social network acquired WhatsApp in a  19 billion deal in 2014 For people who aren t celebrities or billionaires  the decision to abandon Facebook came reluctantly  because the platform often served as their sole connection to certain relatives  friends and professional opportunities Here  some newly Facebook free users of social media discuss why they left       Richard H  PerryA filmmaker in Los AngelesFor a long time now  Mr  Perry had wanted to leave Facebook He never felt comfortable knowing that the company had access to much of his personal information  In the months before the 2016 presidential election  he watched the social network become what he called  a garbage platform of ads and weird reposted articles and people that you care about exposing themselves as racists  But Facebook was also where Mr  Perry promoted his films  where he posted ads seeking help on the set  and where he communicated with colleagues and a  massive number  of his friends and relatives Until he heard about Cambridge Analytica  I suspected this stuff was going on  but this is the first time it s been plainly exposed   he said   It seems so malicious  and Facebook seems so complicit all the way up and down  like it doesn t care about its users  Mr  Perry  39  has since deleted his profile and plans to switch to Twitter and Instagram for his social media needs  It was an easy decision   he said   It s not going to be the end of the world        Dan ClarkA retired Navy veteran in MaineMr  Clark kept one Facebook account to chat with friends and a separate account to keep tabs on members of his family nationwide  This week  he deleted both  Facebook was the main platform I used to keep in touch with all of them  and it was a difficult decision to give it up   he said   But you have to stand for something  so I just put my foot down and said enough is enough  Mr  Clark  57  said he had already been angry with Facebook for censoring some of his posts  which he said expressed his staunchly conservative views but were  never evil or putting anybody down   He could not abide the idea that his personal information was also being sold or given away without his consent Before cutting the cord  Mr  Clark posted on Facebook inviting his contacts to ask him for his personal phone number  More than 100 people reached out within three days  There are just so many ways nowadays to stay in contact  phones  email  instant message  Gab  which is a social network that doesn t censor anything   he said   Facebook is more obsolete than people would think        Alexandra KleemanA writer on Staten IslandHer first experience with fake news   a Facebook post claiming that Pope Francis had endorsed Mr  Trump s candidacy   altered the way Ms  Kleeman looked at Facebook  It changed the psychological and emotional feel of the platform for me   she said   I don t have a great feeling when I log in  The Cambridge Analytica scandal led her to remove the Facebook app from her phone   I m not going to give them my engagement clicks   Ms  Kleeman  32  said  But she is keeping the messaging function open for professional purposes and will continue using Instagram She doesn t mind the idea that some personal data can be made public   she used to have a blog  she said  But the idea that my data could be used for purposes that I expressly don t want  that freaks me out        Paul MusgraveAn assistant professor in Amherst  Mass Twitter makes Mr  Musgrave feel depressed about the world  but Facebook is the social media platform he is trying to abandon As a political science teacher at the University of Massachusetts Amherst  Mr  Musgrave  36  feels a professional responsibility to keep abreast of the news and academic chatter hurtling at him in the form of tweets Facebook was more valuable to him as a  low key  offstage networking tool   a  replacement for end of year family newsletters  that allowed him to  passively keep up with people   he said  He joined the platform more than a decade ago and before that had been a member of Friendster  a precursor to Facebook But in 2016  while helping his mother during her campaign for a government position in Indiana  Mr  Musgrave discovered a  poisonous swamp  of content on the site  The Cambridge Analytica findings were even more disturbing  he said  This is a company that has Orwellian levels of data about us  truly Big Brother level  but it s behaving as if it has no social responsibility and is a purely neutral medium of communication   he said   That s what s really been scary  Having deactivated his Facebook account  with plans to delete it  he now worries about connecting with people who use the social network as their main conduit of communication  I m definitely pruning myself away from some of those really important branches   he said   I watch my own students try to navigate the world of apps and smartphones  and even they don t really know how the internet works outside these enclosed garden spaces        Ben GreenzweigAn entrepreneur in Westchester  N Y Once Mr  Greenzweig confirms that the 1 195 photos and 85 videos in his Facebook profile have downloaded  he plans to delete the account he has maintained for nearly a decade Mr  Greenzweig  40  said the Cambridge Analytica news was  the last straw   We have surpassed the tipping point  where the benefit now fails to outweigh the cost   he said   But I will definitely miss what the promise of Facebook used to be   a way to connect to community in a very global and local context  A year ago  Mr  Greenzweig was an  extraordinarily active  Facebook user who juggled conversations with friends  managed several groups  took out ads for his business and maintained professional contacts But on Tuesday night  in his final post  he asked his network to connect with him through email  LinkedIn  Twitter or phone  See everyone in the real world   he wrote "
" After this story was published  Facebook came under harsh criticism from lawmakers in the United States and Britain  Read the latest  LONDON   As the upstart voter profiling company Cambridge Analytica prepared to wade into the 2014 American midterm elections  it had a problem The firm had secured a  15 million investment from Robert Mercer  the wealthy Republican donor  and wooed his political adviser  Stephen K  Bannon  with the promise of tools that could identify the personalities of American voters and influence their behavior  But it did not have the data to make its new products work So the firm harvested private information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users without their permission  according to former Cambridge employees  associates and documents  making it one of the largest data leaks in the social network s history  The breach allowed the company to exploit the private social media activity of a huge swath of the American electorate  developing techniques that underpinned its work on President Trump s campaign in 2016 An examination by The New York Times and The Observer of London reveals how Cambridge Analytica s drive to bring to market a potentially powerful new weapon put the firm   and wealthy conservative investors seeking to reshape politics   under scrutiny from investigators and lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic Christopher Wylie  who helped found Cambridge and worked there until late 2014  said of its leaders   Rules don t matter for them  For them  this is a war  and it s all fair   They want to fight a culture war in America   he added   Cambridge Analytica was supposed to be the arsenal of weapons to fight that culture war  Details of Cambridge s acquisition and use of Facebook data have surfaced in several accounts since the business began working on the 2016 campaign  setting off a furious debate about the merits of the firm s so called psychographic modeling techniques But the full scale of the data leak involving Americans has not been previously disclosed   and Facebook  until now  has not acknowledged it  Interviews with a half dozen former employees and contractors  and a review of the firm s emails and documents  have revealed that Cambridge not only relied on the private Facebook data but still possesses most or all of the trove Cambridge paid to acquire the personal information through an outside researcher who  Facebook says  claimed to be collecting it for academic purposes During a week of inquiries from The Times  Facebook downplayed the scope of the leak and questioned whether any of the data still remained out of its control  But on Friday  the company posted a statement expressing alarm and promising to take action  This was a scam   and a fraud   Paul Grewal  a vice president and deputy general counsel at the social network  said in a statement to The Times earlier on Friday  He added that the company was suspending Cambridge Analytica  Mr  Wylie and the researcher  Aleksandr Kogan  a Russian American academic  from Facebook   We will take whatever steps are required to see that the data in question is deleted once and for all   and take action against all offending parties   Mr  Grewal said Alexander Nix  the chief executive of Cambridge Analytica  and other officials had repeatedly denied obtaining or using Facebook data  most recently during a parliamentary hearing last month  But in a statement to The Times  the company acknowledged that it had acquired the data  though it blamed Mr  Kogan for violating Facebook s rules and said it had deleted the information as soon as it learned of the problem two years ago In Britain  Cambridge Analytica is facing intertwined investigations by Parliament and government regulators into allegations that it performed illegal work on the  Brexit  campaign  The country has strict privacy laws  and its information commissioner announced on Saturday that she was looking into whether the Facebook data was  illegally acquired and used  In the United States  Mr  Mercer s daughter  Rebekah  a board member  Mr  Bannon and Mr  Nix received warnings from their lawyer that it was illegal to employ foreigners in political campaigns  according to company documents and former employees Congressional investigators have questioned Mr  Nix about the company s role in the Trump campaign  And the Justice Department s special counsel  Robert S  Mueller III  has  demanded the emails of Cambridge Analytica employees who worked for the Trump team as part of his investigation into Russian interference in the election While the substance of Mr  Mueller s interest is a closely guarded secret  documents viewed by The Times indicate that the firm s British affiliate claims to have worked in Russia and Ukraine  And the WikiLeaks founder  Julian Assange  disclosed in October that Mr  Nix had reached out to him during the campaign in hopes of obtaining private emails belonging to Mr  Trump s Democratic opponent  Hillary Clinton The documents also raise new questions about Facebook  which is already grappling with intense criticism over the spread of Russian propaganda and fake news  The data Cambridge collected from profiles  a portion of which was viewed by The Times  included details on users  identities  friend networks and  likes   Only a tiny fraction of the users had agreed to release their information to a third party  Protecting people s information is at the heart of everything we do   Mr  Grewal said   No systems were infiltrated  and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked  Still  he added   it s a serious abuse of our rules  The Bordeaux flowed freely as Mr  Nix and several colleagues sat down for dinner at the Palace Hotel in Manhattan in late 2013  Mr  Wylie recalled in an interview  They had much to celebrate Mr  Nix  a brash salesman  led the small elections division at SCL Group  a political and defense contractor  He had spent much of the year trying to break into the lucrative new world of political data  recruiting Mr  Wylie  then a 24 year old political operative with ties to veterans of President Obama s campaigns  Mr  Wylie was interested in using inherent psychological traits to affect voters  behavior and had assembled a team of psychologists and data scientists  some of them affiliated with Cambridge University The group experimented abroad  including in the Caribbean and Africa  where privacy rules were lax or nonexistent and politicians employing SCL were happy to provide government held data  former employees said Then a chance meeting brought Mr  Nix into contact with Mr  Bannon  the Breitbart News firebrand who would later become a Trump campaign and White House adviser  and with Mr  Mercer  one of the richest men on earth Mr  Nix and his colleagues courted Mr  Mercer  who believed a sophisticated data company could make him a kingmaker in Republican politics  and his daughter Rebekah  who shared his conservative views  Mr  Bannon was intrigued by the possibility of using personality profiling to shift America s culture and rewire its politics  recalled Mr  Wylie and other former employees  who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had signed nondisclosure agreements  Mr  Bannon and the Mercers declined to comment Mr  Mercer agreed to help finance a  1 5 million pilot project to poll voters and test psychographic messaging in Virginia s gubernatorial race in November 2013  where the Republican attorney general  Ken Cuccinelli  ran against Terry McAuliffe  the Democratic fund raiser  Though Mr  Cuccinelli lost  Mr  Mercer committed to moving forward The Mercers wanted results quickly  and more business beckoned  In early 2014  the investor Toby Neugebauer and other wealthy conservatives were preparing to put tens of millions of dollars behind a presidential campaign for Senator Ted Cruz of Texas  work that Mr  Nix was eager to win When Mr  Wylie s colleagues failed to produce a memo explaining their work to Mr  Neugebauer  Mr  Nix castigated them over email  ITS 2 PAGES   4 hours work max  or an hour each   What have you all been doing    he wrote Mr  Wylie s team had a bigger problem  Building psychographic profiles on a national scale required data the company could not gather without huge expense  Traditional analytics firms used voting records and consumer purchase histories to try to predict political beliefs and voting behavior But those kinds of records were useless for figuring out whether a particular voter was  say  a neurotic introvert  a religious extrovert  a fair minded liberal or a fan of the occult  Those were among the psychological traits the firm claimed would provide a uniquely powerful means of designing political messages Mr  Wylie found a solution at Cambridge University s Psychometrics Centre  Researchers there had developed a technique to map personality traits based on what people had liked on Facebook  The researchers paid users small sums to take a personality quiz and download an app  which would scrape some private information from their profiles and those of their friends  activity that Facebook permitted at the time  The approach  the scientists said  could reveal more about a person than their parents or romantic partners knew   a claim that has been disputed When the Psychometrics Centre declined to work with the firm  Mr  Wylie found someone who would  Dr  Kogan  who was then a psychology professor at the university and knew of the techniques  Dr  Kogan built his own app and in June 2014 began harvesting data for Cambridge Analytica  The business covered the costs   more than  800 000   and allowed him to keep a copy for his own research  according to company emails and financial records All he divulged to Facebook  and to users in fine print  was that he was collecting information for academic purposes  the social network said  It did not verify his claim  Dr  Kogan declined to provide details of what happened  citing nondisclosure agreements with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica  though he maintained that his program was  a very standard vanilla Facebook app  He ultimately provided over 50 million raw profiles to the firm  Mr  Wylie said  a number confirmed by a company email and a former colleague  Of those  roughly 30 million   a number previously reported by The Intercept   contained enough information  including places of residence  that the company could match users to other records and build psychographic profiles  Only about 270 000 users   those who participated in the survey   had consented to having their data harvested Mr  Wylie said the Facebook data was  the saving grace  that let his team deliver the models it had promised the Mercers  We wanted as much as we could get   he acknowledged   Where it came from  who said we could have it   we weren t really asking  Mr  Nix tells a different story  Appearing before a parliamentary committee last month  he described Dr  Kogan s contributions as  fruitless  Just as Dr  Kogan s efforts were getting underway  Mr  Mercer agreed to invest  15 million in a joint venture with SCL s elections division  The partners devised a convoluted corporate structure  forming a new American company  owned almost entirely by Mr  Mercer  with a license to the psychographics platform developed by Mr  Wylie s team  according to company documents  Mr  Bannon  who became a board member and investor  chose the name  Cambridge Analytica The firm was effectively a shell  According to the documents and former employees  any contracts won by Cambridge  originally incorporated in Delaware  would be serviced by London based SCL and overseen by Mr  Nix  a British citizen who held dual appointments at Cambridge Analytica and SCL  Most SCL employees and contractors were Canadian  like Mr  Wylie  or European But in July 2014  an American election lawyer advising the company  Laurence Levy  warned that the arrangement could violate laws limiting the involvement of foreign nationals in American elections In a memo to Mr  Bannon  Ms  Mercer and Mr  Nix  the lawyer  then at the firm Bracewell   Giuliani  warned that Mr  Nix would have to recuse himself  from substantive management  of any clients involved in United States elections  The data firm would also have to find American citizens or green card holders  Mr  Levy wrote   to manage the work and decision making functions  relative to campaign messaging and expenditures  In summer and fall 2014  Cambridge Analytica dived into the American midterm elections  mobilizing SCL contractors and employees around the country  Few Americans were involved in the work  which included polling  focus groups and message development for the John Bolton Super PAC  conservative groups in Colorado and the campaign of Senator Thom Tillis  the North Carolina Republican Cambridge Analytica  in its statement to The Times  said that all  personnel in strategic roles were U S  nationals or green card holders   Mr  Nix  never had any strategic or operational role  in an American election campaign  the company said Whether the company s American ventures violated election laws would depend on foreign employees  roles in each campaign  and on whether their work counted as strategic advice under Federal Election Commission rules Cambridge Analytica appears to have exhibited a similar pattern in the 2016 election cycle  when the company worked for the campaigns of Mr  Cruz and then Mr  Trump  While Cambridge hired more Americans to work on the races that year  most of its data scientists were citizens of the United Kingdom or other European countries  according to two former employees Under the guidance of Brad Parscale  Mr  Trump s digital director in 2016 and now the campaign manager for his 2020 re election effort  Cambridge performed a variety of services  former campaign officials said  That included designing target audiences for digital ads and fund raising appeals  modeling voter turnout  buying  5 million in television ads and determining where Mr  Trump should travel to best drum up support Cambridge executives have offered conflicting accounts about the use of psychographic data on the campaign  Mr  Nix has said that the firm s profiles helped shape Mr  Trump s strategy   statements disputed by other campaign officials   but also that Cambridge did not have enough time to comprehensively model Trump voters In a BBC interview last December  Mr  Nix said that the Trump efforts drew on  legacy psychographics  built for the Cruz campaign By early 2015  Mr  Wylie and more than half his original team of about a dozen people had left the company  Most were liberal leaning  and had grown disenchanted with working on behalf of the hard right candidates the Mercer family favored Cambridge Analytica  in its statement  said that Mr  Wylie had left to start a rival firm  and that it later took legal action against him to enforce intellectual property claims  It characterized Mr  Wylie and other former  contractors  as engaging in  what is clearly a malicious attempt to hurt the company  Near the end of that year  a report in The Guardian revealed that Cambridge Analytica was using private Facebook data on the Cruz campaign  sending Facebook scrambling  In a statement at the time  Facebook promised that it was  carefully investigating this situation  and would require any company misusing its data to destroy it Facebook verified the leak and   without publicly acknowledging it   sought to secure the information  efforts that continued as recently as August 2016  That month  lawyers for the social network reached out to Cambridge Analytica contractors   This data was obtained and used without permission   said a letter that was obtained by the Times   It cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately  Mr  Grewal  the Facebook deputy general counsel  said in a statement that both Dr  Kogan and  SCL Group and Cambridge Analytica certified to us that they destroyed the data in question  But copies of the data still remain beyond Facebook s control  The Times viewed a set of raw data from the profiles Cambridge Analytica obtained While Mr  Nix has told lawmakers that the company does not have Facebook data  a former employee said that he had recently seen hundreds of gigabytes on Cambridge servers  and that the files were not encrypted Today  as Cambridge Analytica seeks to expand its business in the United States and overseas  Mr  Nix has mentioned some questionable practices  This January  in undercover footage filmed by Channel 4 News in Britain and viewed by The Times  he boasted of employing front companies and former spies on behalf of political clients around the world  and even suggested ways to entrap politicians in compromising situations All the scrutiny appears to have damaged Cambridge Analytica s political business  No American campaigns or  super PACs  have yet reported paying the company for work in the 2018 midterms  and it is unclear whether Cambridge will be asked to join Mr  Trump s re election campaign In the meantime  Mr  Nix is seeking to take psychographics to the commercial advertising market  He has repositioned himself as a guru for the digital ad age   a  Math Man   he puts it  In the United States last year  a former employee said  Cambridge pitched Mercedes Benz  MetLife and the brewer AB InBev  but has not signed them on "
"NEW YORK    Facebook is facing the most serious crisis in its 14 year history as it deals with fallout from a major leak of user data to political consultants associated with the 2016 Trump campaign Here s a look at the scandal and what it means WHAT S GOING ON The U K  based data mining firm Cambridge Analytica has been accused of lifting the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users without their permission in order to manipulate elections  A former employee of the firm  Christopher Wylie  played a role in that action  and later told his story to journalists The crisis has renewed questions about Facebook s ability to protect the privacy of its users while also exploiting their personal details to fuel its lucrative advertising business  It has also deepened concerns about the social media network s ability to avoid being exploited to spread propaganda and sway elections Authorities in both the U S  and the U K  are investigating both Facebook and Cambridge Analytica  Facebook shares have fallen and some users are contemplating deleting their accounts    WHAT DID CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA DO Wylie says the firm sought Facebook information in order to build psychological profiles on a large portion of the U S  electorate  He said the company was able to amass the database quickly with the help of an academic  Aleksander Kogan  who developed a Facebook app called  This is Your Digital Life  that appeared to be a personality test That app vacuumed up information from users who gave the app permission to access their accounts   as well as additional data from their Facebook friends Kogan paid about 200 000 people to take part  tens of millions of their friends were also caught in the data dragnet    HOW HAS CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA RESPONDED Cambridge Analytica has denied wrongdoing  and the firm said it deleted any data it received from Kogan and denied using any Facebook data in its political work  Facebook  however  said it recently learned from journalists that Cambridge Analytica may have kept some of the data  spurring an investigation Kogan said he has been scapegoated by both Cambridge and Facebook  He says the data firm approached him for the project and assured him that everything he did was legal    WHAT S THE CONNECTION TO THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN Federal election records show that the Trump campaign paid Cambridge Analytica roughly  6 million  But the campaign has denied using the firm s data  saying it relied on the Republic National Committee for its voter information Cambridge Analytica was backed by the conservative billionaire Richard Mercer  a hedge fund manager who supported the Trump campaign  At one point  the firm s vice president was Steve Bannon  who later became Trump s campaign chairman and White House adviser Trump s former national security adviser  Michael Flynn  disclosed an advisory role with Cambridge Analytica last August  But the firm s parent company  Strategic Communication Laboratories  later said that position never materialized  Special counsel Robert Mueller is scrutinizing the connections between Trump s campaign and Cambridge Analytica Wylie  the whistleblower who worked for Cambridge from 2013 to 2015  said his team spoke to Americans in focus groups to identify deep seated concerns and tested ways to tap into those fears through social media  He claims the slogans they developed later became the catchphrases of the Trump campaign  including  drain the swamp  and  build the wall  Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix was caught bragging about the firm s pivotal role in the Trump campaign on a sting video from the U K  s Channel 4  He said Cambridge handled  all the data  all the analytics  all the targeting  for the campaign    WHY ARE PEOPLE MAD AT FACEBOOK The Cambridge Analytics fiasco appears to have crystallized the anxiety many people feel about Facebook s enormous sway over daily life and its massive data trove A sell off in Facebook shares reflects fear that the social network may face new regulations that could hurt profits   or that advertisers and users will sour on it A U K  parliamentary media committee is investigating how Facebook uses data  and has summoned CEO Mark Zuckerberg to testify  Various U S  congressional committees are also seeking answers  although Democrats and Republicans have disagreed on what steps to take  Privacy advocates have asked the Federal Trade Commission to investigate as well The hashtag  deletefacebook has been trending  Brian Acton  the co founder of WhatsApp  which was acquired by Facebook four years ago for  19 billion  has joined the cause  But there are no signs  so far  that users   or advertisers   are abandoning Facebook in droves    HOW IS FACEBOOK ADDRESSING THE CRISIS After five days of silence  Zuckerberg released a Facebook post admitting mistakes and outlining steps to protect user data  He followed up with rare media appearances where he apologized for a breach of trust Facebook s response  however  is limited to a narrow range of technical changes that will further limit the data apps can collect and lead to audits of apps that exhibit troubling behavior Zuckerberg also emphasized steps the company has already taken  including reducing access outside apps had to user data in 2014  That came too late to stop Cambridge  The company said nothing about overhauling its data collection policies or taking steps to prevent the unauthorized political use of Facebook data Facebook suspended Cambridge over allegations that it kept the improperly obtained user data  It has also suspended the access of Kogan and Wylie  as well as Cambridge s parent company  SCL "

"DUBLIN   As Ireland prepares to vote in May on a referendum on whether to repeal its ban on abortion  anti abortion campaigners can be seen rallying most weekdays on the streets of Dublin  outside Parliament  and at universities  news media buildings and the offices of human rights groups They arrive wearing body cameras and bearing placards with graphic images of aborted fetuses But not all of them are Irish Of the eight members of the anti abortion Irish Center for Bio Ethical Reform who protested outside the offices of The Irish Times on a recent weekday  only three   including the group s leader  Jean Engela   are Irish  The others include Americans and a Hungarian  We try to be as multinational as the abortion industry  and they make no apologies for sending in their international affiliates to pontificate to the Irish people   said Dr  Engela The protests   relatively small but highly visible here in the Irish capital   are an emblem of the strong emotions as the country prepares to vote in late May on whether to retain the Eighth Amendment of the Irish Constitution  which bans abortion in nearly all circumstances and was itself enacted by a referendum  in 1983   Abortion was illegal before 1983  but the amendment made it even harder to terminate a pregnancy  even to save to mother s life  To the age old debates around abortion   including questions of when life begins and of women s control over their reproductive rights   the referendum has added a new dimension of concern about potential outside interference in the vote An ethics regulator recently ordered two abortion rights groups  Amnesty International Ireland and the Abortion Rights Campaign  to return grants of  150 000 and  25 000 to George Soros s Open Society Foundations  It said the money was a foreign political donation intended to affect the outcome of a referendum or election  and therefore banned But so far it does not appear that any anti abortion groups have been asked to return overseas donations  despite reports that money is being openly raised on their behalf  particularly in the United States One American group  the Pro Life Action League  told an Irish newspaper in 2012 that anti abortion groups were raising hundreds of thousands of dollars to support Irish anti abortion groups like Youth Defence  which has been linked to far right movements in Europe Youth Defence did not respond to a request for comment  The Pro Life Action League s executive director  Eric J  Scheidler  said that the remarks concerned American support for the Irish anti abortion movement over several decades  and said his group had not raised money for the current campaign The Irish Center for Bio Ethical Reform  which picketed The Irish Times  receives foreign funding but claims to be exempt from government oversight   We are an educational body   Dr  Engela said He denied that the protest had anything to do with the coming vote  and asserted that some of the volunteers were full time activists with their own sources of funding Some commentators argue that anti abortion groups are not being held to the same stringent standard as abortion rights groups Theresa Reidy  a political scientist at University College Cork  said that there was a long history of overseas interests taking sides in Irish referendums  particularly on issues like the European Union  Over the last decade  even as support for the abortion ban has waned  concerns about possible outside interference have risen  she said Siobhan Mullally  of the Irish Center for Human Rights at the National University of Ireland  Galway  said the problem of undeclared foreign funding went beyond the abortion debate  and was  also a question about how charities are funded in general  The Roman Catholic Church  long a major power in Ireland  was the main driver in the 1983 referendum  The church also opposed  successfully  a referendum in 1986 that would have legalized divorce  In the decades since  however  its social and moral authority has been gravely weakened by a number of scandals  most notably clerical child sex abuse The church could not prevent the legalization of contraception and was on the losing side in referendums that legalized divorce in 1995 and same sex marriage in 2015 As a result  today s anti abortion activists are less overtly religious in their arguments  Instead  they are turning to arguments that abortion harms women s health  They are also turning to social media tools After recent revelations about the misuse of Facebook data to sway Britain s referendum on European Union membership in 2016  and the United States presidential election later that year  fears are growing similar tactics might be used in the referendum campaign The Save the 8th Campaign  an anti abortion group  has hired Kanto Systems  a London based political consultancy  to help run its campaign Kanto Systems s founder  Thomas Borwick  was chief technology officer for the Vote Leave campaign in Britain  and developed a canvassing app for Cambridge Analytica  the data mining organization that exploited Facebook data on behalf of the 2016 Trump campaign Mr  Borwick said that he himself had not worked for the Trump campaign  and referred a reporter to a statement from Save the 8th  which said that Kanto would be performing  some data analytics for us  but would not be engaged in  any voter profiling or voter targeting  John McGuirk  a spokesman for Save the 8th  said that in the Irish electoral system  which does not have online voter rolls  individually targeted advertising of the sort practiced by Cambridge Analytica would not be possible   In terms of targeting advertising at individual voters  we couldn t do that even if we wanted to  which we don t   he said The Times of London reported that the Pro Life Campaign  Ireland s largest umbrella anti abortion group  has retained uCampaign  a Washington firm that has developed apps for the Trump campaign  the National Rifle Association  the Republican National Committee and Vote Leave   Neither uCampaign nor the Pro Life Campaign responded to requests for comment  The Transparent Referendum Initiative  a small group of Irish technology advocates  said it had already detected paid social media campaigns stealthily targeting Irish voters  This month  the group introduced a crowdsourced monitoring tool to detect and investigate anonymous or vaguely sourced paid advertising on Facebook  It has already identified 92 such ads relating to the Irish referendum  55 with anti abortion messages and 37 in support of abortion rights Political advertising is banned on Irish television and radio  but the online world is a different matter  There is no law against someone anywhere else in the world signing a commercial contract with a British company to use foreign money or unknown money  that is not going through any official regulated campaign  in order to influence an Irish vote   said Liz Carolan of the Transparent Referendum Initiative   There s a serious vulnerability in our democratic system  And it s now being exploited by incredibly sophisticated campaign techniques  and Facebook doesn t have to tell us who s doing it  Responding to the Cambridge Analytica revelations  the Irish government announced last week that it planned to give Irish regulators new powers to curb external influence on Irish voters A spokeswoman for Facebook s Dublin office said that the company agreed with the need for more transparency in advertising  and that it was developing a new tool to help people identify paid ads in their timelines and to identify and label political content  However  she said  the tools will not be ready in time for the May referendum "

"Good Wednesday  Here s what we re watching   Are we witnessing the end of the tech mania   Amazon has shed more than  50 billion in market value  Are investors waking up to Tesla s real problem   Mark Zuckerberg agreed to testify before Congress   SoftBank and Saudi Arabia are planning the world s largest solar energy project Get this in your inbox each morning  Sign up here Investors  always willing to believe in technology companies  spent the last three years piling into the shares of companies like Facebook  Amazon and Netflix with special abandon  Now the intellectual underpinnings of the tech rally are being seriously tested Stocks in the best known tech companies have plunged in recent days  The NYSE FANG  index  which tracks the share price of 10 companies  including Facebook  Apple and Amazon  has fallen nearly 14 percent from its recent high  Given that the index has soared 50 percent in just the past 12 months  the recent decline could just be the sort of sell off that punctuates any long term rally Still  several large tech companies suddenly face challenges that could undermine their ability to transform whole industries  And as we ve seen after previous fervors  investors can take a long time to regain their faith Facebook is down 20 percent from its recent high  Most of the slide came after news reports showing how the company s data was misused  Investors have to grapple with the possibility that Facebook won t be sharing as much data as it does  undermining its ability to generate ever increasing amounts of advertising revenue Nvidia  a computer chip maker intent on being a leader in automated driving technology  is off 12 percent from its recent high  The company said on Tuesday that it would halt tests of its autonomous driving technology on public roads after an Uber self driving car hit and killed a pedestrian in Arizona Tesla is not a tech stock  but it is included in the FANG  index  and its supporters believe deeply in its power to revolutionize the auto industry  Growing fears about Tesla s ability to finance its expansion have helped drag its stock down 33 percent from its recent high  Ominously  the price of Tesla s bonds is also falling  signaling that the company is losing the confidence of creditors Of course  on their march higher  tech stocks overcame obstacles  like management problems at Uber and the poor performance of Snap s initial public offering But the latest problems have raised deeper  broader doubts  and that may keep the uncertainty around longer  Investors have viewed automated driving technology as a huge potential source of growth for some companies  But after the Uber incident in Arizona  those companies may take a more realistic look at what they have to spend to create a technology that is efficient and safe  and conclude that they have to pull out of the race or pare back  Users of social media and regulators may prevent social media companies from sharing so much of their data with advertisers  and that could restrain revenue growth And if the passion for two or three big tech companies wanes  the cooling may spread   Peter EavisThe reason Reports that President Trump wants to rein in the e commerce giant Jonathan Swan of Axios  citing anonymous sources  reported Mr  Swan added Shares of Amazon have tumbled more than 7 percent at one point Wednesday  but they pared those losses after a White House official told Reuters there were no specific policy changes related to Amazon being considered at the moment  But the official added that the administration is always looking at different options on a range of policy issues How concerned should investors be GBH Insights analyst Daniel Ives writes Guess which companies are benefiting from Amazon s woes  Retailers  the FT points out On a day when the stocks on Wall Street are flat  Macy s was up 3 5 percent  J C  Penney has gained 5 5 percent  Walmart rose 1 7 percent  Target increased 1 8 percent  and Kohl s was up 2 4 percent The electric carmaker s shares are down 7 percent Wednesday  after plunging 8 percent on Tuesday Tuesday s slide was driven  in part  by the National Transportation Safety Board s announcement that it was investigating a fatal crash last week involving a Tesla vehicle in California  News that Jaguar Land Rover was teaming up with Alphabet Inc  s Waymo unit probably didn t help either But the continued decline in Tesla s stock   its shares are down more than 20 percent since mid March   speaks to the bigger concern surrounding Tesla  How it funds itself Investors have grown increasingly worried as Tesla burns through cash and struggles to meet its own production goals for the Model 3  Late Tuesday  Moody s downgraded Tesla s credit rating further into junk territory and said its outlook on the company is negative  The credit ratings agency cited production delays and said Tesla may soon need to raise more than  2 billion Those concerns can be seen not just in Tesla s stock price but also in the trading of its debt  The FT points out that  Tesla s eight year bond maturing in 2025 traded on Wednesday at 87 6 cents to the dollar  the lowest since issuance  The yield has surged to 7 5 percent from 6 59 percent on Monday  Liam Denning of Bloomberg Gadfly writes The fallout from Facebook s Cambridge Analytica scandal has spread to Twitter The stock tumbled 12 percent Tuesday after Citron Research s Andrew Left said he was betting against the social media company because of its vulnerability to regulation around how it handles user data But analysts at Barclays disagree  They argue in a recent note to clients that Twitter s data business likely won t be impacted much by any regulation on its use of user data  The credit reporting company named Mark Begor  a private equity executive who once led General Electric s credit card business  as its new chief executive Mr  Begor  59  takes over for Paulino do Rego Barros Jr   who has filled the role on an interim basis since September  when Richard F  Smith stepped down after a data breach exposed sensitive personal information  including Social Security numbers  of 148 million people Mr  Begor will start at Equifax on April 16 About Mr  Begor  The 59 year old is a managing director at the private equity firm Warburg Pincus  He is also a member of the board at the credit scoring company FICO   Mr  Begor spent 35 years at General Electric  where his duties included leading the conglomerate s real estate investment and energy management units  For nine years  he was president and chief executive of the company s consumer credit business  which was later spun off as Synchrony Financial His pay packageEquifax said it would give Mr  Begor stock and options valued at  17 million this year and an annual salary and bonus of up to  4 5 million President Trump has scored a significant trade deal with South Korea But with Mr  Trump preparing to meet with North Korea s

pushing the South to sign  More from Michael D  Shear and Alan Rappeport The Trump administration continues to ramp up its trade rhetoric with China  Unidentified sources told Bloomberg that it is considering invoking an emergency law to restrict Chinese investments in sensitive U S  tech  A separate plan to enact tariffs on  60 billion of Chinese goods has left companies wondering which industries will be targeted  Other Asian countries increasingly fear being caught in the crossfire of a trade war  the WSJ reports And nations are already reacting to Trump s trade moves  erecting  barriers to stop the steel and aluminum that faces tariffs in the U S  being dumped in their markets Against this background  NXP sold its 40 percent stake in a Chinese joint venture on chip design Companies like Facebook  Amazon and Alphabet have delivered some of the best returns to investors in recent years  powered by the achievements and the promise of social media and artificial intelligence But that confidence is evaporating  as investors brace for intensified regulatory scrutiny across the industry  Tech stocks took a pummeling yesterday and in early European trading Twitter dropped 12 percent after Andrew Left s Citron Research said it was shorting the company Critic s corner  The  sector s growing clout over everyday life also raises the risks of what can go wrong   Dan Gallagher argues at WSJ s Heard on the Street The public outcry over Facebook s data and privacy settings has grown loud enough that Mark Zuckerberg now says he s willing to testify to

you in the face is the stock price  down nearly 30 percent this year  Ugly  but it could be a good entry point  It gives you time to try out some tough measures aimed at improving Deutsche Bank s performance  Even if those moves produce near term losses  the stock may not dive  given how far it s already fallen Then you look at the strength of Deutsche Bank s capital  as expressed by a regulatory measure called the common equity tier 1 capital ratio  That s at 14 percent  a solid looking level  achieved in part by an  8 billion equity raise last year  In theory  you have something to spend on your chosen plans But then you realize that Deutsche Bank s share price is now back at the level at which the bank sold those shares  Shareholders must be livid  Not only that  Deutsche Bank s stock market value is less than 40 percent of its net worth as stated on its balance sheet  its stock price is  11 30 and its book value per share is  30 16   When a company trades at a hefty

revenue  which can be far more unpredictable than revenue from other businesses  Last year  revenue from Deutsche Bank s corporate and investment bank  which has struggled to keep up with its peers  accounted for 54 percent of the bank s overall revenue  Compare that with JPMorgan Chase  whose investment bank accounted for a third of its revenue last year  And you are stuck with the Wall Street operations  no one wants to buy an investment bank with  1 2 trillion in assets Maybe you can cut costs  another go to tactic of an incoming C E O  Indeed  Deutsche Bank s investment bank employees seem better paid than their counterparts at other firms  Going by a back of the envelope calculation  the unit s compensation expense is equivalent to 44 percent of its revenue  excluding the interest the investment bank earns on its assets   That s higher than the 39 percent ratio for JPMorgan s investment bank last year  and 41 percent for Goldman Sachs  Maybe you could slash the pay of bankers

Contenders for the post should address one question  What will you do to clean up the culture at banks William C  Dudley  the outgoing president of the New York Fed  had made improving the culture at the firms he oversaw a key initiative of his tenure of at the institution When Mr  Dudley took the helm in 2009  the financial crisis had left the New York Fed s reputation as a regulator damaged  The institution had not done enough to address the severe weaknesses at the banks it oversaw  like Citigroup  Early on  Mr  Dudley commissioned a review of the New York Fed s bank supervision department and then overhauled it  But in 2012  JPMorgan Chase  also overseen by the New York Fed  suffered huge trading losses in what was known as the London Whale scandal  The New York Fed was faulted Following the embarrassing London Whale imbroglio  Mr  Dudley used his bully pulpit to focus on bankers  ethics  Banks were stronger financially  but recent scandals showed that the culture of their firms still needed to improve  he observed  And if a cleanup didn t occur  it may be a sign that they needed to be reduced in size  Mr  Dudley said in a 2014 speech that rattled Wall Street The next big banking scandal   Wells Fargo s widespread mistreatment of customers  which came to light in 2016   strongly supported Mr  Dudley s arguments  Wells Fargo was considered one of the most stable  too big to fail  banks  with its focus on plain vanilla lending  but in fact  its retail sales culture had degraded  The Fed earlier this year slapped relatively harsh sanctions on the bank  including a limit on its size The example of Wells Fargo is pertinent for John C  Williams  a top candidate to replace Mr  Dudley  Mr  Williams is head of the San Francisco Fed  which oversees Wells Fargo And there is still work to do to fulfill Mr  Dudley s initiative  He proposed a  database of banker misconduct   similar to the one for brokers  that would track a banker s record on ethics and compliance  Banks could consult it before hiring  But this idea has not taken off  In a speech at the U S  Chamber of Commerce on Monday  Mr  Dudley explained why   Understandably  firms are concerned about legal risk if they share information about banker misconduct  but there may be ways to address these concerns through legislation  Mr  Dudley had also pressed banks  boards of directors to focus on ethical culture  On Monday  he said the boards had set up separate committees to focus on culture and conduct   We ve made part of the journey but I think more could be done   Mr  Dudley said  Whether it will  depends on who steps into his shoes   Peter EavisThe yield curve is near its flattest level since the financial crisis  The difference between the yields on the two year and 10 year Treasury notes is at 0 52 percentage points  not far off its post crisis low of 0 50 percentage points hit in January That has some asking if the nine year old economic recovery is at risk Since the end of World War II  no barometer has done a better job of predicting a recession than the yield curve  A flattening yield curve tends to indicate slowing economic growth in the near future  But what is more worrisome is if the yield curve goes beyond flattening and into outright inversion The chances of a recession when the yield curve is flattening is just 20 percent  according to the calculations of Jim Paulsen  the chief investment strategist at the Leuthold Group  That jumps to 72 percent when the curve inverts There is another reason not to be too concerned about a flattening yield curve  and it has to do with the actions of central banks around the world  The unprecedented stimulus from the Fed  Bank of Japan and E C B  have brought down long term rates  That means the yield curve might not be the predictor it once was A week after a self driving Uber vehicle hit and killed a woman in Arizona  the fallout continues to spread Nvidia on Tuesday said it had suspended self driving tests

"I don t need to tell you that something is wrong with social media You ve probably experienced it yourself  Maybe it s the way you feel while scrolling through your Twitter feed   anxious  twitchy  a little world weary   or your unease when you see a child watching YouTube videos  knowing she s just a few algorithmic nudges away from a rabbit hole filled with lunatic conspiracies and gore  Or maybe it was this month s Facebook privacy scandal  which reminded you that you ve entrusted the most intimate parts of your digital life to a profit maximizing surveillance machine Our growing discomfort with our largest social platforms is reflected in polls  One recently conducted by Axios and SurveyMonkey found that all three of the major social media companies   Facebook  Twitter and Google  which shares a parent company with YouTube   are significantly less popular with Americans than they were five months ago   And Americans might be the lucky ones  Outside the United States  social media is fueling real world violence and empowering autocrats  often with much less oversight  But it would be a mistake to throw up our hands and assume that it has to be this way  The original dream of social media   producing healthy discussions  unlocking new forms of creativity  connecting people to others with similar interests   shouldn t be discarded because of the failures of the current market leaders  And lots of important things still happen on even the most flawed networks  The West Virginia teachers  strike and last weekend s March for Our Lives  for example  were largely organized on Facebook and Twitter The primary problem with today s social networks is that they re already too big  and are trapped inside a market based system that forces them to keep growing  Facebook can t stop monetizing our personal data for the same reason that Starbucks can t stop selling coffee   it s the heart of the enterprise Many of the fixes being proposed involve regulation  The Honest Ads Act  a bill in the Senate  would require greater transparency for online political ads  The European Union s General Data Protection Regulation  which goes into effect in May  aims to give users greater control of their digital information trails But these efforts don t touch the underlying problems  and in fact could make it harder for start ups to compete with the giants If we re really serious about changing how social networks operate  far more radical interventions are required  Here are three possible ways to rescue social media from the market based pressures that got us here In their book  New Power   which comes out next week  Jeremy Heimans and Henry Timms write about the struggle between centralized  top down institutions  which represent  old power   and decentralized  bottom up movements  which represent  new power  Facebook  they write  is an example of a new power institution that serves old power interests  It harvests the creative output of billions of people and turns it into a giant  centralized enterprise  with most users sharing none of the economic value they create and getting no say in the platform s governance Instead  the authors ask  what if a social network was truly run by its users  If you re contributing economic value to something of this much social consequence  you should share in the value you re creating   Mr  Heimans told me Nathan Schneider  a professor of media studies at the University of Colorado  had a similar idea in 2016  when he proposed that Twitter users band together to buy the platform from its shareholders and convert it into a user run collective  similar to the way a local credit union is run  People who made valuable contributions to the network  such as employees and power users  would receive bigger stakes and more voting power  And users would have a seat at the table for major decisions about the platform s operations It s exceedingly unlikely that Mark Zuckerberg  who has fought hard to keep control of Facebook  will ever convert the company into a user owned and run collective  But Mr  Schneider believes that giving more control to responsible users could help restore trust in the network  and signal the kind of values Mr  Zuckerberg says he wants Facebook to represent  He could show that he takes democracy seriously enough to start with his own baby   Mr  Schneider said Another radical approach would be to make social networks work more like email   so that independent apps could seamlessly work together with one another  across a common protocol Instead of one big Facebook  a federated social network would look like clusters of independent nodes   Mombook and Athletebook and Gamerbook   all of which could be plugged into the umbrella network when it made sense  Rather than requiring a one size fits all set of policies that apply to billions of users  these nodes could be designed to reflect users  priorities   A network for privacy hawks and one for open sharing maximalists could have different data retention rules  and a network for L G B T  users and one for evangelical pastors could have different hate speech rules   If a node became too toxic  it could be removed without shutting down the entire network  Email is the most resilient social network on the internet   Mr  Schneider said   and the thing that allows it to adapt is that it s an open protocol  and people build apps on top of it  and we evolve how we use it  Versions of this kind of network already exist  Mastodon  a decentralized Twitter like social network  has gotten more than a million registered users since its debut in 2016  And various social networks based on the blockchain   the ledger system that underlies virtual currencies like Bitcoin   have sprung up in recent months To be sure  decentralized networks have their own problems  They re messy to administer  and they can still be gamed by bad actors  They can also fall prey to the same kind of privacy issues that Facebook is being criticized for   In fact  part of the reason users are angry at Facebook right now is that the company s data infrastructure was too open  and made it overly simple for third party app developers to take user information outside Facebook  None of this is a panacea  But experimenting with more decentralized models could give social media users a sense that platforms represented their interests  rather than those of a faceless corporation A single friend of mine once remarked that the major difference among dating apps like OKCupid  Tinder and Bumble wasn t the way they were designed or the companies behind them   it was how long they had existed New apps  she said  were more likely to attract interesting and smart people who were actually looking for dates  Older apps  by contrast  were eventually overrun with creeps and predators  no matter how well built they were A similar theory might apply to social networks  Facebook  Twitter  YouTube  Instagram and Snapchat all had plenty of issues in their early years  but they were by and large cleaner  with fewer types of exploitation and malicious behavior  Today  the enormous size and influence of these platforms have made them irresistible honey pots for bad actors  and many of our  social graphs    Facebook s term for the webs of digital connections we create   are clogged with years  worth of clutter In a blog post last year  the venture capitalist Hunter Walk proposed an interesting idea  a legally mandated  start over  button that  when pressed  would allow users of social networks to delete all their data  clear out their feeds and friend lists  and begin with a fresh account I d go even further  and suggest that social networks give their users an automatic  self cleaning  option  which would regularly clear their profiles of apps they no longer used  friendships and followers they no longer interacted with  and data they no longer needed to store  If these tools were enabled  users would need to take affirmative action if they didn t want their information to disappear after a certain number of months or years Making social graphs temporary  rather than preserving them forever by default  would undoubtedly be bad for most social networks  business models  But it could create new and healthy norms around privacy and data hygiene  and it would keep problems from piling up as networks get older and more crowded  It might even recapture some of the magic of the original social networks  when things were fresh and fascinating  and not quite so scary "
"A parade of regulators  politicians and law enforcement officials demanded to know more about Facebook s privacy practices on Monday  as the fallout from the company s relationship with a political data firm continued to spread Early in the day  the Federal Trade Commission confirmed reports that it was investigating how Facebook handles information about its users Soon after  Senator Charles E  Grassley  Republican of Iowa and chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee  invited Mark Zuckerberg  Facebook s chief executive  to testify about privacy standards next month  He also extended invitations to Google s chief executive  Sundar Pichai  and Twitter s chief executive  Jack Dorsey And a group of 37 attorneys general sent Mr  Zuckerberg a letter asking for details about Facebook s privacy safeguards But one group of people interested in Facebook   investors   had a muted reaction to the growing regulatory threat  Shares of Facebook fell sharply after the F T C  confirmed its investigation but ended the day up 0 4 percent as overall trading on Wall Street recovered from a big drop last week The federal investigation and threats followed recent news that the data collection firm Cambridge Analytica  which worked on the 2016 Trump presidential campaign  gained access to the personal data of more than 50 million Facebook users The F T C  said it planned to determine whether the social media giant had violated a consent decree it signed in 2011 to protect users  privacy The decree required Facebook to notify and receive explicit permission from users before sharing their personal information beyond the limits dictated by their privacy settings  Each violation of the agreement  which the agency reached with Facebook as part of a settlement over third party apps  carries a penalty of up to  40 000 a day The agency s acknowledgment of its investigation helped push Facebook s stock down as much as 6 5 percent on Monday morning before it recovered  Facebook said last week that it was anticipating an inquiry by the agency The F T C  said in a statement on Monday that it  takes very seriously recent press reports raising substantial concerns about the privacy practices of Facebook  Lawmakers have repeatedly called for Mr  Zuckerberg to appear in hearings on Capitol Hill  Last week  the Republican and Democratic leaders of the House and Senate commerce committees formally invited him to testify  I m sure this is much bigger than Cambridge Analytica  and I m sure there are other Cambridge Analyticas out there   Senator John Kennedy  Republican from Louisiana  said in an interview   Facebook isn t just a company  It is so powerful it is like a country  Some lawmakers  such as Senator Richard Blumenthal  Democrat from Connecticut  asked the F T C  to look into whether Facebook should pay damages to users  The sphere of scrutiny must be broader than just the consent decree   he said in a statement   There is no excuse for delay  Cambridge Analytica is facing intense criticism  too  On Monday  Common Cause  a government watchdog group in Washington  filed complaints seeking federal investigations into allegations that the company violated federal election law In an article that detailed how Cambridge Analytica obtained information about millions of Facebook users  The New York Times reported this month that employees of the data research firm with European or Canadian citizenship had worked extensively for its American clients during the 2014 and 2016 elections  despite a warning from its own election lawyer The employees worked on polling  message development  and the designing of target audiences for digital ads and fund raising appeals The company said the work was permissible because none of the foreign employees had  strategic  or  operational  roles  But former employees contradicted that account  suggesting that the work violated laws in the United States that strictly limit what non Americans can do for American political campaigns Common Cause filed one complaint with the Justice Department  which has authority to investigate  knowing and willful  violations of campaign law  The group also filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission  which has day to day jurisdiction over enforcing election rules  It defies belief that even after their own attorney warned them that they would be violating the prohibition on performing certain election related activities in U S  elections that they did so anyway   said Paul S  Ryan  Common Cause s vice president for policy and litigation In the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco  lawyers appealed two lawsuits that challenged the social media company s privacy and user data policies  One lawsuit claims that Facebook violates the Electronic Communications Privacy Act  Wiretap Act  and state law equivalents because of the way it monitors its users on and off the platform The second suit claims that Facebook has been capturing and selling the details of users  browsing of third party health sites  Any site with a Facebook  like  button  including those of medical institutions such as the American Cancer Society and the American Society of Clinical Oncology  could be used to track users as they browsed outside Facebook  according to the lawsuit Facebook also has been targeted by several shareholder lawsuits since the reports detailing Cambridge Analytica s use of Facebook user information Many users have threatened to deactivate or delete their accounts to protest Facebook s stewardship of their personal data  The  deletefacebook campaign  as it has been called  has even received support from a creator of WhatsApp  one of Facebook s most popular services  who sold his company to the social media giant for  19 billion in 2014  Elon Musk  the chief executive of SpaceX and Tesla  removed the Facebook pages of both companies on Friday While the Cambridge Analytica revelations have renewed regulatory interest in Facebook in the United States  pressure on the company in other countries has been building for years The company has been the subject of several privacy investigations and charges by European regulators  And Europe has approved a new privacy law  which takes effect in May  that will give users of Facebook  Google and other internet services more control over how their data is collected and what Silicon Valley companies know about them "

"Good morning  Want to get California Today by email  Here s the sign up  More than 10 years ago  Arnold Schwarzenegger  then the Republican governor of California  told an audience of conservative leaders that the California Republican Party had moved too far to the right and was  dying at the box office   How right I was   Mr  Schwarzenegger said in a rare return public appearance on Wednesday   The party was going down and down and down  Today we are the Titanic after it hit the iceberg   but before the last bit of the ship submerged  Mr  Schwarzenegger was speaking at a youth center in East Los Angeles marking the start of an organization of moderate California Republicans trying to move the way out of power state party to the center   and back  organizers said  into being a player in state governance  The organization is called New Way California and was put together by Assemblyman Chad Mayes  who was ousted as the Republican minority leader after voting with Democrats on extending the cap and trade automobile emission program  We seek to shed the stereotype of the intolerant Republican Party that serves only the rich and big business   Mr  Mayes said Mr  Schwarzenegger was not the only Republican firepower on stage  John Kasich  the governor of Ohio  who is considering challenging President Trump for the Republican nomination in 2020  was also on hand In Sacramento  the former governor   and occasional actor   broke with national Republicans  at least of today  when he championed environmental protection efforts  including stringent emission controls  In sentiments also reflected by Mr  Kasich and Mr  Mayes  Mr  Schwarzenegger said the Republican Party had to be  environmentally progressive  socially liberal and fiscally conservative  in order to be competitive  Our party is giving them Twitter fights instead of answers   Mr  Schwarzenegger said   And it is sinking us  It is time to return to the issues   The politics of division and

"Revelations that a voter profiling company that worked Donald J  Trump s presidential campaign harvested private information from 50 million Facebook profiles have many people wondering  What  if anything  can they do to protect their data connected to the social network Here s the harsh truth  Not much  short of ceasing to browse the web entirely or deleting your Facebook account Yet there are some best practices you can employ to help safeguard your data  such as installing software to block web tracking technologies and carefully vetting the apps that you use on Facebook But it also helps to understand what exactly happened with those 50 million profiles in order to determine how you can better protect your data  Here s what you need to know An academic researcher at Cambridge University built an app called thisisyourdigitallife  which offered to pay Facebook users to take a personality test and agree to share that data for academic use  About 270 000 people participated in the study   enough to extract information on tens of millions of Facebooks users How did Cambridge Analytica get data on 50 million people when only 270 000 people had agreed to hand over their information to a third party  Facebook said people who downloaded the app gave consent for the app to collect limited information about their friends whose privacy settings were set to allow it That information was eventually paid for by Cambridge Analytica  the voter profiling company that worked with the Trump campaign There is a multipronged approach you can take to protect yourself from data harvesting apps and programs  That includes tools you can install in your browser and settings you can tweak on Facebook  Here s a run down of what you should do   Audit your Facebook apps  If you used Facebook to sign in to a third party website  game or app  those services may continue to access your personal data  On Facebook  go to the settings page and click on the Apps tab to see which apps are connected to your account  From there  you can take a closer look at the permissions you granted to each app to see what information you are sharing  Remove any apps that you find suspicious or no longer use   Facebook has also made some changes to prevent the gathering of detailed information of friends of users  On the App Settings page there is another setting called Apps Others Use  This is where you choose which details are shared about you when your friends use apps  Make sure to uncheck all the boxes if you don t want any of your information  like your birthday or hometown  accessed by your friends  apps   Audit your Facebook privacy settings  If you are concerned about what details apps can see about you and your Facebook friends  now is a good time to check your privacy settings and minimize the information you share publicly  For example  you can make sure that only your friends can see your Facebook posts  or that only you can see your friends list   Read privacy policies  When you sign up for a new app or web tool  the company typically asks you to agree to its terms of service  Make it a habit to peruse the terms and pay particular attention to the privacy policy  If you see language that suggests your data could be shared in a way that makes you uncomfortable  don t use the program   Install a tracker blocker  There are add ons that you can install in your browser that try to block trackers embedded on websites  But be aware that in some cases  they will make parts of websites work improperly  In our tests  Disconnect and Privacy Badger were useful tools for blocking trackers on Google s Chrome browser Here s a primer on how tracking works  to give you a sense of why blockers are important  When you engage with an app on Facebook  it may plant a tracker in your web browser  like a cookie  that collects information from you  Even when you close out of the app  the tracker can continue to follow your activities  like the other sites you visit or the people you interact with through status updates  according to Michael Priem  chief executive of Modern Impact  an advertising firm in Minneapolis  It doesn t go away after you ve stopped looking at the ad   he said   Install an ad blocker  Another way to block trackers is to prevent ads from loading altogether  Ad blockers are also add ons that you can install for your browser on your mobile device or computer  Mobile ads are fully functioning programs  and they sometimes include malware that harvest some of your data  Even the largest websites do not have tight control over the ads that appear on their sites   and sometimes malicious code can appear inside their ad networks  A popular ad blocker among security researchers is uBlock Origin   Clear your browsing data  Periodically  you can clear your cookies and browsing history  Apple  Google and Microsoft have published instructions on how to clear data for their browsers Safari  Chrome and Internet Explorer  That will temporarily delete cookies and trackers  though they will probably reappear over time   Be wary of unknown brands  Even if you read the privacy policies  you still may have to take them with a grain of salt  In the case of the thisisyourdigitallife app  the fine print said the information would be collected for academic use  not commercial purposes  So think twice before sharing information with unfamiliar companies or organizations   Then again  the researcher came from Cambridge University  one of the world s top schools   so who can you really trust  "
"Good Wednesday  Here s what we re watching   Mark Zuckerberg has broken his silence on the Cambridge Analytica crisis   Why driverless cars are essential to Uber s future   Jerome Powell s first Federal Reserve meeting as chairman   Pete Peterson  the co founder of Blackstone and a former chairman of Lehman Brothers  has died   Facebook and other tech companies might need a new privacy regulator   How companies are pressing for tariff exemptions Get this in your inbox each morning  Sign up here Facebook s chief executive posted a statement on his Facebook page  saying he was taking action to prevent people s data on the social network from being misused  We have a responsibility to protect your data  and if we can t then we don t deserve to serve you   Mr  Zuckerberg wrote   I ve been working to understand exactly what happened and how to make sure this doesn t happen again  Here are the steps the company is taking to address the issue    We will investigate all apps that had access to large amounts of information before we changed our platform to dramatically reduce data access in 2014  and we will conduct a full audit of any app with suspicious activity     We will restrict developers  data access even further to prevent other kinds of abuse     We want to make sure you understand which apps you ve allowed to access your data  In the next month  we will show everyone a tool at the top of your News Feed with the apps you ve used and an easy way to revoke those apps  permissions to your data  Mr  Zuckerberg had drawn criticism for his response to how Cambridge Analytica improperly obtained data on 50 million Facebook users  In the days since the news first broke this weekend  he had not commented publicly on the crisis That contrasts with how other tech chief executives have addressed crises at their firms Kevin Roose and Sheera Frenkel of the NYT report So why did it take so long for Mr  Zuckerberg to respond  Kate Losse  an early Facebook employee and Mr  Zuckerberg s former speechwriter  told the NYT   My guess is that what is giving Zuckerberg pause at this point is the question of how to acknowledge and explain this state of affairs while at the same time mitigating the concerns that will come from people finally understanding how this all worked  Peter Eavis s take  There was something missing from Mark Zuckerberg s response   a full explanation of why Facebook took so long to disclose the misuse of its data  As Mr  Zuckerberg noted  Facebook found out in 2015 that Aleksandr Kogan had violated company policies by sharing user data with Cambridge Analytica  Facebook users might ask why the abuse wasn t disclosed at the time  Often it has taken pressure from outsiders to get Facebook to reveal abuses of its network  An alternative approach would have been for Facebook to proactively disclose as much information as possible about the wrongdoing  Facebook users would most likely welcome a strong commitment from Mr  Zuckerberg to do just that The Federal Reserve  as widely expected  raised interest rates on Wednesday by a quarter of a percentage point  The bigger questions were about the strength of the economy and pace of future rate increases On those matters  the Federal Reserve has expressed more confidence in the strength of the economy Dot plot  Fed officials signaled they would raise rates at a quicker pace over the next three years  Policymakers now expect to hike rates three times this year  three times in 2019 and twice in 2020  At its December meeting  policymakers expected three rate hikes this year  but just two in 2019 Economic projections  Officials raised their median estimates for economic growth this year to 2 7 percent  up from 2 5 percent in December  Fed policymakers also expect inflation to run above 2 percent by 2019 and 2020 Mr  Powell s news conference  The new Fed chairman expressed optimism about the current economic picture and said officials were trying to strike a balance between raising rates too slowly or too quickly   We re trying to take that middle ground  Mr  Powell left the door open to more or fewer than three increases this year  depending on economic conditions   Like any set of forecasts  those forecasts will change over time   he said   It could change up  It could change down On inflation  he added   There is no sense in the data that we re on the cusp of an acceleration of inflation  We have seen moderate increases in wages and price inflation  And we seem to be seeing more of that  The answer has to do with car ownership  For years  Uber and its rivals have promoted the idea that people living in urban areas will turn to Uber to get to and from work and to run errands rather than buy a car If Uber can become an alternative to car ownership  that would greatly increase its potential market A study last year from the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute  Texas A M Transportation Institute  and Columbia University suggested that people might make the switch But for people give up their cars  the cost of using Uber would most likely have to fall far below current levels  The need for this drop in costs came up when Dara Khosrowshahi  the C E O  of Uber  recently sat down for an interview with David Solomon  president and C O O  of Goldman Sachs Here s the write up of the autonomous car portion of their conversation in a recent Goldman note to clients The pedestrian fatality in Arizona is perhaps Dara Khosrowshahi s first major test as Uber s C E O   leaving him with a difficult choice  keep

"For much of the past week  Facebook has been embroiled in a controversy involving Cambridge Analytica  a political consulting firm with ties to Donald J  Trump s 2016 presidential campaign  and how the firm improperly obtained and exploited personal data from 50 million Facebook users On Wednesday  following widespread questions about his whereabouts  Mark Zuckerberg  the chief executive of Facebook  spoke with two New York Times reporters  Sheera Frenkel and Kevin Roose  about the controversy and the steps he was taking to make the social network less prone to abuse Below is a transcript of the conversation  edited for length and clarity Sheera Frenkel  Did it come as a surprise to you  the user response to the news that Cambridge Analytica had accessed this trove of data Mark Zuckerberg  Privacy issues have always been incredibly important to people  One of our biggest responsibilities is to protect data  If you think about what our services are  at their most basic level  you put some content into a service  whether it s a photo or a video or a text message   whether it s Facebook or WhatsApp or Instagram   and you re trusting that that content is going to be shared with the people you want to share it with  Whenever there s an issue where someone s data gets passed to someone who the rules of the system shouldn t have allowed it to  that s rightfully a big issue and deserves to be a big uproar Frenkel  It took quite a few days for your response to come out  Is that because you were weighing these three action points that you noted in your post Zuckerberg  The first thing is  I really wanted to make sure we had a full and accurate understanding of everything that happened  I know that there was a lot of pressure to speak sooner  but my assessment was that it was more important that what we said was fully accurate The second thing is  the most important thing is that we fix this system so that issues like this don t happen again  It s not like there aren t going to be other different kind of things we ll also have to fix  But when there s a certain problem  we have a responsibility to at least make sure we resolve that problem So the actions here that we re going to do involve first  dramatically reducing the amount of data that developers have access to  so that apps and developers can t do what Kogan did here  The most important actions there we actually took three or four years ago  in 2014  But when we examined the systems this week  there were certainly other things we felt we should lock down  too  So we re going ahead and doing that Even if you solve the problem going forward  there s still this issue of  Are there other Cambridge Analyticas out there  or other Kogans who  when the platform worked a certain way in the past  were there apps which could have gotten access to more information  and potentially sold it without us knowing  or done something that violated people s trust  We also need to make sure we get that under control  That s why we spent a lot of time figuring out  O K  here s what it s going to take to do a full investigation of every app that got access to a large amount of information before we changed the platform policies to dramatically reduce the data access that developers had  For any app that we uncover that has any suspicious activity  we re going to go do a full forensic audit  and make sure we have the capacity to do that  to make sure that other developers aren t doing what Kogan did here The third thing is  it s really important that people know what apps they ve authorized  A lot of people have been on Facebook now for five or 10 years  and sometimes you signed into an app a long time ago and you may have forgotten about that  So one of the steps we re taking is making it so apps can no longer access data after you haven t used them for three months But it s also just really important to put in front of people a tool of  here are all the apps you ve connected to and authorized  here s an easy way to deauthorize them  to revoke their permission to get access to your activity Kevin Roose  Is Facebook planning to notify the 50 million users whose data was shared with Cambridge Analytica Zuckerberg  Yes  We re going to tell anyone whose data may have been shared Now  there s a question of whether we have the exact record in our systems today of who your friends were on that day when there was access three and a half or four years ago  so we re going to be conservative on that and try to tell anyone whose data may have been affected  even if we don t know for certain that they were  It s likely that we ll build a tool like we did with the Russian misinformation investigation  that anyone can go to it and see if their data was affected by this Roose  Do you have a preliminary estimate of how many apps you ll be investigating Zuckerberg  It will be in the thousands Frenkel  Were those app developers notified that you ll be investigating this yet Zuckerberg  Just when I posted  And we ll be reaching out in the near term Frenkel  Are you going to be hiring people to help conduct those investigations Zuckerberg  Yes  I would imagine we re going to have to grow the team to work on this Roose  You mentioned a contract that developers will have to sign in order to ask anyone for access to broader profile information  What will be the terms of that contract  and what will be the penalties for violating it Zuckerberg  So  the important thing there is that it s a high touch process  The specific point we were trying to make is that it s not going to be some terms of service that a developer can sign up for just on their computer when developing something  I guess technically  that would be a contract as well The point of what we re trying to do here is to create a situation where we have a real person to person relationship with any developer who is asking for the most sensitive data  That doesn t mean that   if you re a developer and you want to put Facebook Login on your website  you can do that  If you want to get access to ask people for their religious affiliation  or their sexual orientation  for data that could be very sensitive  we want to make sure we have a clear relationship with those people Frenkel  We understood that Cambridge Analytica had reached out to Facebook and asked that its ban on the platform be reconsidered  Are you giving any thought to allowing Cambridge Analytica back in Zuckerberg  The first thing we need to do is conduct this full forensic audit of the firm  that they don t have any people s data from our community and that they ve deleted anything  including derivative data  that they might have  We re working with the regulator in the U K  on this  so our forensic audit was actually paused in the near term to cede the way for the ICO there to do their own government investigation  We re certainly not going to consider letting them back onto the platform until we have full confirmation that there s no wrongdoing here Roose  There were reports as far back as 2015 that Cambridge Analytica had access to this data set  Why didn t you suspend them then Zuckerberg  So  we actually heard  I think it was at the end of 2015   some journalists from The Guardian reached out to us and told us what you just said  And it was not just about Cambridge Analytica  it was about this developer  Aleksandr Kogan  who had shared data with them We took action immediately at that point  We banned Kogan s app from the platform  we demanded that Kogan and Cambridge Analytica and a couple other parties that Kogan had shared the data with would legally certify that they didn t have the data  and weren t using it in any of their operations  They gave us that formal certification  At the time  they told us they never had gotten access to raw Facebook data  so we made that decision Frenkel  In retrospect  do you wish you had demanded proof that the data had been deleted Zuckerberg  Yes  They gave us a formal and legal certification  and it seems at this point that that was false Again  we haven t done our full investigation and audit yet so I can t say definitively that they actually have data  I ve just read all the same reports that you have  including in The New York Times  that says that journalists have seen evidence that they have the data  which is a strong enough signal for us to go on  and take action here That s the basic driver behind us now needing to go and do a full investigation into any app that had access to a large amount of data before we locked down the platform policies in 2014  Just having folks tell us that they were using the data correctly  I think  does not satisfy our responsibility to our community to protect their data Frenkel  Are you actively looking at some of these dark web data brokers that have been in news reports recently  that say that other independent researchers are potentially trading in this data Zuckerberg  Yes  we re investigating that too Roose  Are you worried about the  DeleteFacebook campaign that s been going around  Have you seen meaningful numbers of people deleting their accounts  and are you worried that will be a trend Zuckerberg  I don t think we ve seen a meaningful number of people act on that  but  you know  it s not good  I think it s a clear signal that this is a major trust issue for people  and I understand that  And whether people delete their app over it or just don t feel good about using Facebook  that s a big issue that I think we have a responsibility to rectify Frenkel  We re now heading into the 2018 midterms  Could you speak about what Facebook is going to do ahead of the 2018 midterms to make people feel more confident that the platform won t be used this way again Zuckerberg  This is an incredibly important point  There s no doubt that in 2016  there were a number of issues including foreign interference and false news that we did not have as much of a handle on as we feel a responsibility to for our community Now  the good news here is that these problems aren t necessarily rocket science  They re hard  but they re things that if you invest and work on making it harder for adversaries to do what they re trying to do  you can really reduce the amount of false news  make it harder for foreign governments to interfere One of the things that gives me confidence is that we ve seen a number of elections at this point where this has gone a lot better  In the months after the 2016 election  there was the French election  The new A I  tools we built after the 2016 elections found  I think  more than 30 000 fake accounts that we believe were linked to Russian sources who were trying to do the same kind of tactics they did in the U S  in the 2016 election  We were able to disable them and prevent that from happening on a large scale in France In last year  in 2017 with the special election in Alabama  we deployed some new A I  tools to identify fake accounts and false news  and we found a significant number of Macedonian accounts that were trying to spread false news  and were able to eliminate those  And that  actually  is something I haven t talked about publicly before  so you re the first people I m telling about that I feel a lot better about the systems now  At the same time  I think Russia and other governments are going to get more sophisticated in what they do  too  So we need to make sure that we up our game  This is a massive focus for us to make sure we re dialed in for not only the 2018 elections in the U S   but the Indian elections  the Brazilian elections  and a number of other elections that are going on this year that are really important Frenkel  The Times reported that  Facebook chief security officer Alex  Stamos will be leaving toward the end of this year  Is there a broader plan for how Facebook is going to structure security on its platform ahead of all these important elections Zuckerberg  Sure  One of the important things we ve done is  we want to unify all of our security efforts  And you reported on a reorg around Alex Stamos  and I ll say something about him in a second  He s been a very valuable contributor here and was a really central figure in helping us identify the foreign interference with Russia  And I think he has done very good work  and I m hopeful he ll be engaged for a while here on that One of the big things we needed to do is coordinate our efforts a lot better across the whole company  It s not all A I   right  There s certainly a lot that A I  can do  we can train classifiers to identify content  but most of what we do is identify things that people should look at  So we re going to double the amount of people working on security this year  We ll have more than 20 000 people working on security and community operations by the end of the year  I think we have about 15 000 now  So it s really the technical systems we have working with the people in our operations functions that make the biggest deal The last thing I d add on this  Take things like false news  You know  a lot of it is really spam  if you think about it  It s the same people who might have been sending you Viagra emails in the  90s  now they re trying to come up with sensational content and push it into Facebook and other apps in order to get you to click on it and see ads  There are some pretty basic policy decisions we ve made  like O K   if you re anywhere close to being a fake news site  you can t put Facebook ads on your site  right  So then suddenly  it becomes harder for them to make money  If you make it hard enough for them to make money  they just kind of go and do something else Roose  Is the basic economic model of Facebook  in which users provide data that Facebook uses to help advertisers and developers to better target potential customers and users   do you feel like that works  given what we now know about the risks Zuckerberg  Yeah  so this is a really important question  The thing about the ad model that is really important that aligns with our mission is that   our mission is to build a community for everyone in the world and to bring the world closer together  And a really important part of that is making a service that people can afford  A lot of the people  once you get past the first billion people  can t afford to pay a lot  Therefore  having it be free and have a business model that is ad supported ends up being really important and aligned Now  over time  might there be ways for people who can afford it to pay a different way  That s certainly something we ve thought about over time  But I don t think the ad model is going to go away  because I think fundamentally  it s important to have a service like this that everyone in the world can use  and the only way to do that is to have it be very cheap or free Roose  Adam Mosseri  Facebook s head of News Feed  recently said he had lost some sleep over Facebook s role in the violence in Myanmar  You ve said you re  outraged  about what happened with Cambridge Analytica  but when you think about the many things that are happening with Facebook all over the world  are you losing any sleep  Do you feel any guilt about the role Facebook is playing in the world Zuckerberg  That s a good question  I think  you know  we re doing something here which is unprecedented  in terms of building a community for people all over the world to be able to share what matters to them  and connect across boundaries  I think what we re seeing is  there are new challenges that I don t think anyone had anticipated before If you had asked me  when I got started with Facebook  if one of the central things I d need to work on now is preventing governments from interfering in each other s elections  there s no way I thought that s what I d be doing  if we talked in 2004 in my dorm room I don t know that it s possible to know every issue that you re going to face down the road  But we have a real responsibility to take all these issues seriously as they come up  and work with experts and people around the world to make sure we solve them  and do a good job for our community It s certainly true that  over the course of Facebook  I ve made all kinds of different mistakes  whether that s technical mistakes or business mistakes or hiring mistakes  We ve launched product after product that didn t work  I spend most of my time looking forward  trying to figure out how to solve the issues that people are having today  because I think that s what people in our community would want "
"WASHINGTON   The political action committee founded by John R  Bolton  President Trump s incoming national security adviser  was one of the earliest customers of Cambridge Analytica  which it hired specifically to develop psychological profiles of voters with data harvested from tens of millions of Facebook profiles  according to former Cambridge employees and company documents Mr  Bolton s political committee  known as The John Bolton Super PAC  first hired Cambridge in August 2014  months after the political data firm was founded and while it was still harvesting the Facebook data In the two years that followed  Mr  Bolton s super PAC spent nearly  1 2 million primarily for  survey research   which is a term that campaigns use for polling  according to campaign finance records But the contract between the political action committee and Cambridge  a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times  offers more detail on just what Mr  Bolton was buying  The contract broadly describes the services to be delivered by Cambridge as  behavioral microtargeting with psychographic messaging  To do that work  Cambridge used Facebook data  according to the documents and two former employees familiar with the work  The data and modeling Bolton s PAC received was derived from the Facebook data   said Christopher Wylie  a data expert who was part of the team that founded Cambridge Analytica   We definitely told them about how we were doing it  We talked about it in conference calls  in meetings  Cambridge Analytica  which rose to prominence through its work with Mr  Trump s 2016 election campaign  has found itself confronting a deepening crisis since reports this past weekend in The New York Times and The Observer of London that the firm had harvested the data from more than 50 million Facebook profiles in its bid to develop techniques for predicting the behavior of individual American voters Cambridge s so called psychographic modeling techniques  which were built in part with the data harvested from Facebook  underpinned its work for Mr  Trump s campaign in 2016  setting off a furious   and still unsettled   debate about whether the firm s technology worked  The same techniques were also the focus of its work for Mr  Bolton s super PAC  The Bolton PAC was obsessed with how America was becoming limp wristed and spineless and it wanted research and messaging for national security issues   Mr  Wylie said  That really meant making people more militaristic in their worldview   he added   That s what they said they wanted  anyway  Using the psychographic models  Cambridge helped design concepts for advertisements for candidates supported by Mr  Bolton s PAC  including the 2014 campaign of Thom Tillis  the Republican senator from North Carolina  according to Mr  Wylie and another former employee  who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid being dragged into the investigations that now appear to be engulfing Cambridge One advertisement  a video that was posted on YouTube  was aimed at people who scored high for conscientiousness  and were thought to respect hard work and experience  It emphasized Mr  Bolton s time working for Ronald Reagan and how Mr  Tillis embodied the spirit and political ethos of the late president Beyond their conservative politics  Mr  Trump  Mr  Bolton and Cambridge Analytica all share a patron   the Mercer family of Long Island  whose patriarch  Robert L  Mercer  made a fortune at the helm of a top yielding hedge fund Cambridge Analytica  which grew out of the London based SCL Group  was founded in 2014 with a  15 million investment from Mr  Mercer  whose daughter Rebekah sits on the firm s board of directors  Stephen K  Bannon was also a co founder At the same time  Mr  Mercer was financially supporting Mr  Bolton s PAC  donating  5 million between April 2014 and September 2016  according to Federal Election Commission filings  The Mercers also backed Mr  Trump in the presidential election The Mercer family has not publicly commented since the reports about the misuse of Facebook data by Cambridge first surfaced in The Times and The Observer The reports have prompted calls from lawmakers in Britain and the United States for renewed scrutiny of Facebook  and at least two American state prosecutors have said they are looking into the misuse of data by Cambridge Analytica The company also suspended its chief executive  Alexander Nix  after a television broadcast this week in which he was recorded suggesting that the company had used seduction and bribery to entrap politicians and influence foreign elections But it is the harvesting of Facebook data that has cast the harshest spotlight on Cambridge  and Mr  Bolton s experience with the company appears to have provided a model for how it sold itself to future political campaigns  including Mr  Trump s The firm took the psychographic profiles it was building off the Facebook data at the time and combined them with voter databases and other sets of data  Staff from SCL s elections division  which through a convoluted corporate structure was interchangeable with Cambridge  discussed what they were doing at a meeting in July 2014 with another contractor for the Bolton PAC  according to an agenda of the meeting obtained by The Times The profiles would be used to  identify the personality traits of individuals  in states to be targeted by the Bolton PAC  said the agenda  which was prepared for SCL and Cambridge staff   Individuals can be targeted with the right message   it said The agenda also included a line  in boldfaced text  that said SCL wanted to use voter contact lists available to Bolton s campaign to direct people  toward the FB app   Cambridge  working through an outside researcher  used a Facebook app to harvest data from the social network s profiles  The app claimed to be collecting data for academic research  and users were not aware of its true purpose Months later  the relationship between Cambridge and the Bolton PAC had grown so close that the firm was writing up talking points for Mr  Bolton  In an email dated Oct  1  2014  Cambridge staff outlined a few sentences that Mr  Bolton could use to describe the work the new firm was doing for his super PAC  It s not just about how much you spend  It s also about how smart you spend   the email advised Mr  Bolton to say  One way we re doing that is by enlisting an outside firm    Cambridge Analytica    to provide deepdive research into who makes up our audience of target voters   it continued   We are producing ads specifically designed for voters of a certain personality and demographic profile  So if you re a young woman in New Hampshire with a specific kind of personality and a particular set of issues that you care about  our research allows us to connect with that voter in a way that truly resonates with her  The subject line of the email   Did Bannon come back to you on this  "
"LONDON   The whistle blower Christopher Wylie held a roomful of British lawmakers rapt for three and a half hours on Tuesday  like a pink haired  nose ringed oracle sent from the future to explain data In testimony to the House of Commons  select committee on culture  Mr  Wylie  a 28 year old Canadian  described the inner workings of SCL  a political consultancy that gave its clients access to a vast collection of personal information harvested from Facebook In one of the longest sessions in recent memory  Mr  Wylie made a number of jaw dropping assertions  most significantly that the company s exploitation of personal data had swung the results of Britain s 2016 referendum on leaving the European Union  He also suggested that his predecessor at Cambridge Analytica was murdered But mostly  Mr  Wylie tried to explain data mining  He looked like a cerebral skate rat  which might in other circumstances have undermined his credibility  but in this case it seemed to help  He was polite  He resembled  as one journalist put it   a patient grandson trying to set up a Skype call with his gran  His message was clear  If you aren t already worried about how your personal data is being used  now would be a good time to start   The way I like to think of it  data is the electricity of our new economy  and electricity can be quite dangerous   he said   We enjoy the benefits of electricity  despite the fact that it can literally kill you  Cambridge Analytica released a statement describing Mr  Wylie as  a part time contractor who left in July 2014 and has no direct knowledge of our work or practices since then   It said Cambridge Analytica  a subsidiary of the SCL political consultancy  did not use its cache of data in Donald J  Trump s 2016 campaign  and had no involvement in the European Union referendum that ended with a victory for those who support withdrawal  or Brexit  from the bloc Mr  Wylie s testimony bluntly contradicted that of his former boss  Alexander Nix  who has recently appeared before the same committee twice  Mr  Wylie said a cluster of pro Brexit organizations employed a Canadian subsidiary company  Aggregate IQ  which provided them with SCL s store of data  I think it is completely reasonable to say that there could have been a different outcome of the referendum had there not been  in my view  cheating   he said He also suggested that Russian intelligence agencies could have easily scooped up the company s vast library of data on American voters in advance of the 2016 elections in the United States  because Aleksandr Kogan  the scientist who collected it  made regular return trips to Russia  Put a key logger in Kogan s computer in Russia and you ve got everything   Mr  Wylie said  He added   It would make it incredibly easy for them to get access to this data  For me  that s concerning and I think it should be looked into  Mr  Wylie s appearance has coincided with a surge of collective dismay over data mining  and many found themselves riveted by his testimony on Tuesday  Georgia Rakusen  33  a user researcher at a technology firm in London  urged her Twitter followers to tune into the hearing  which she called  absolutely gripping stuff  His testimony  she said   was something that  as a lay person  you could watch and start to grasp the enormity of how your data is used   I think maybe people are just beginning to open up  to realize that maybe it s not just about ads  maybe it s not just what bands I like   she said  Ms  Rakusen  who described her own work as  a space where we are supposed to make people click more   said she hoped that employees of large technology companies would come forward more  looking at whistle blowers like Mr  Wylie and Edward J  Snowden  I didn t watch the whole three and a half hours   she said   But I basically didn t get any other work done during that time  Mr  Wylie  who has described himself a  gay Canadian vegan   dropped out of high school but discovered a genius for coding and  still in his teens  began working for political campaigns  He came close to losing his composure at only one moment on Tuesday  when he was asked what prompted him to turn against the technology he had helped create  He said his views had changed when Mr  Trump was elected  It was no longer this niche  shady firm   he said   It was a firm that was making a massive impact on the world  It s a process of coming to terms with what you have created  and the impact that has had   I am incredibly remorseful for my role in setting it up   he added  his voice wavering   I m the first person to say that I should have known better  But what s done is done  He was caustic on the subject of his former boss  Mr  Nix  who he said enjoyed the colonial challenge of manipulating the affairs of less developed countries  He recalled that once  they were late to a meeting because Mr  Nix had to collect a chandelier he had bought for  283 000  You have to remember that a lot of these people are very wealthy already   he said   The thing that I learned is for certain wealthy people  they need something to keep them occupied  They need projects  And for certain wealthy people  going into the developing world and running a country is something that appeals to them  At times  he seemed slightly pitying of British officials who are investigating data mining  saying they did not have enough resources and lacked a  robust technical background   I have had to explain and re explain and re explain and re explain  you know  how relational databases work  what is an eigenvector  what is dimensionality reduction   he said  They have been working really  really hard  But as a point of observation  one of the weak points that I ve seen   again  this is an empathetic criticism   is the lack of technical people   he said  apparently searching for a polite way to say it   They have had to ask me a lot of questions that a database engineer would not ask  "

"SAN FRANCISCO   Facebook s chief executive  Mark Zuckerberg  on Wednesday publicly addressed for the first time the misuse of data belonging to 50 million users of the social network and described the steps the company would take to safeguard the information of its more than two billion monthly users Although his statement addressing a chorus of criticism fell short of a full throated apology  Mr  Zuckerberg said that Facebook would contact users whose data had been harvested through a personality quiz app and passed along to the political data firm Cambridge Analytica  We have a responsibility to protect your data   Mr  Zuckerberg said Wednesday in a Facebook post   and if we can t then we don t deserve to serve you  Mr  Zuckerberg  33  was trying to quell the crisis over the disclosure last weekend that Cambridge Analytica had used data that had been improperly obtained from Facebook as the firm worked on behalf of Donald J  Trump s presidential campaign  Are there other Cambridge Analyticas out there   Mr  Zuckerberg said later in an interview with The New York Times  He added   Were there apps which could have gotten access to more information and potentially sold it without us knowing or done something that violated people s trust  We also need to make sure we get that under control  Mr  Zuckerberg said the company would investigate apps like the third party quiz app that had previously obtained access to  large amounts of information  from the social network  He also said the company would restrict third party developers  access  We also made mistakes  there s more to do  and we need to step up and do it   he wrote in his Facebook statement The Cambridge Analytica revelations added to the questions that have been raised about Facebook s handling of user data and security  Those questions have only intensified as the company has faced criticism over the role its platform played in Russian attempts to influence the 2016 presidential election and the way it has been used to spread misinformation on the internet The resulting backlash is Facebook s worst crisis since it was founded by Mr  Zuckerberg and others in 2004  The information  photos and other content that users post and their frequent engagement with the platform is crucial to the social network  and to the company s profitability  Questions about user privacy and security threaten the company s standing at a time when people are already uneasy about whether the use of technology can bring good or ill Last Friday  after The New York Times  The Observer of London and Channel 4 in Britain told Facebook that Cambridge Analytica had not deleted all of the data it had obtained  the social network banned the political consulting firm and Aleksandr Kogan  the Cambridge University researcher who created the personality quiz app that was used to harvest user data  This was a breach of trust between Kogan  Cambridge Analytica and Facebook   Mr  Zuckerberg wrote on Wednesday   But it was also a breach of trust between Facebook and the people who share their data with us and expect us to protect it  Facebook representatives confirmed that Cambridge Analytica representatives met with Facebook on Tuesday to discuss lifting the ban  Mr  Zuckerberg told The Times he did not rule out allowing Cambridge Analytica back  saying Facebook must first conduct a  full forensic audit of the firm  and  have full confirmation that there s no wrongdoing here  The reaction to the Cambridge Analytica disclosure has been severe  Politicians in the United States and Britain have called for Mr  Zuckerberg to explain how his company handles user data  and state attorneys general in Massachusetts and New York have begun investigating Cambridge Analytica and Facebook  A  DeleteFacebook movement calling on people to close their accounts has also gathered steam In Washington  there have been more calls for regulation of internet companies like Facebook  Mr  Zuckerberg s troubles there were illustrated by the final passage on Wednesday of a bill to combat sex trafficking  The bill would lift liability protections that internet companies have enjoyed for content that users post on their platforms  Facebook and other internet giants had quietly fought the bill for more than a year  but eventually dropped their opposition Lawmakers who have demanded that Mr  Zuckerberg testify before Congress about Facebook s relationship with Cambridge Analytica were not appeased by his statement  You need to come to Congress and testify to this under oath   Senator Ed Markey  Democrat of Massachusetts  tweeted in response to Mr  Zuckerberg s post Independent researchers who have used data from Facebook said that Mr  Zuckerberg s statement did not acknowledge how the gathering of user data was fundamental to the company s operations  He avoided the big issue  which is that for many years  Facebook was basically giving away user data like it was handing out candy   said Jonathan Albright  research director at the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University   There is no question that handing out that data made Facebook the success it is as a company  This has to be recognized as part of their business model and not just a one off problem  In his statement  Mr  Zuckerberg laid out a timeline of Facebook s dealings with Cambridge Analytica  He traced the information sharing issue to 2007  when Facebook decided to become an open platform   enabling people to use Facebook to log into other apps and share detailed personal information about themselves and their friends In 2013  Mr  Kogan  the Cambridge researcher  created a personality quiz app that about 300 000 people installed  Mr  Zuckerberg wrote  Because Facebook was an open platform  Mr  Kogan was able to collect data on tens of millions of friends of those users who had installed the personality quiz app A year later  Mr  Zuckerberg said  Facebook changed its policy to limit how much data third party apps could access   These actions would prevent any app like Kogan s from being able to access so much data today   he wrote By 2015  Mr  Kogan had shared his data and findings with Cambridge Analytica  which later used the material to single out American voters  Mr  Zuckerberg said Facebook had banned Mr  Kogan s app and demanded that the researcher and Cambridge Analytica formally certify that the data had been deleted  He did not address in his post why Facebook had not already disclosed those activities to its users whose data had been harvested by Mr  Kogan and Cambridge Analytica  Whenever there s an issue where someone s data gets passed to someone who the rules of the system shouldn t have allowed it to  that s rightfully a big issue and deserves to be a big uproar   Mr  Zuckerberg said in the interview For Mr  Zuckerberg  the outcry over Cambridge Analytica has been personally damaging  Inside Facebook  even his staunch supporters have described a tense atmosphere  Some employees have sought to transfer to other divisions  such as the messaging app WhatsApp and the photo sharing platform Instagram  calling their work on Facebook s main product  demoralizing  Mr  Zuckerberg spent part of the past week hunkered down with a small group of engineers to discuss how to make information on Facebook s users more secure  and to potentially give them more control of their data  according to two Facebook employees who declined to be named because the proceedings were confidential His silence on the matter has prompted mounting criticism in the past few days  Facebook held a staff meeting on Tuesday to answer questions about Cambridge Analytica and the surrounding outcry  but Mr  Zuckerberg did not appear at the event  He was scheduled to appear at a staff meeting that was set for Friday In his interview with The Times  Mr  Zuckerberg said that the company s efforts to safeguard its platform from bad behavior   which includes preparing for possible interference attempts in the 2018 midterm elections   were an important part of a larger transformation at the company  which has had to adjust from its roots as a social network for college students into a powerful global information hub  If you had asked me  when I got started with Facebook  if one of the central things I d need to work on now is preventing governments from interfering in each other s elections  there s no way I thought that s what I d be doing if we talked in 2004 in my dorm room   Mr  Zuckerberg said "
"LONDON   Two senior advisers to Prime Minister Theresa May might have conspired to bypass electoral spending laws when they were leading a campaign for Britain to leave the European Union  a former employee of their effort said this week  in an interview and in testimony he gave to the country s elections regulator The allegations led to a heated exchange  conducted in the British news media  involving allegations of hard feelings over an old romance and of the deliberate outing by the prime minister s office  No  10 Downing Street  of the former employee as gay The former employee  Shahmir Sanni  said in the interview and in a witness statement submitted to the regulator  the Electoral Commission  that the two advisers had funneled more than  900 000 in campaign spending through a puppet organization that they had set up  They did so  he said  by paying the money to a digital advertising firm that was indirectly linked to the Trump campaign and also worked on the push to exit the European Union Mr  Sanni volunteered at Vote Leave  the main campaign led in part by the two advisers to the prime minister  and then at the organization that he now says was a puppet  called BeLeave  He spoke with The New York Times for a joint reporting project with The Observer of Britain The allegations are the latest of many raised on both sides of the referendum about the possible diversion of money through allied organizations to get around funding limits on each of them  and campaign finance experts said the multitude of such claims pointed to holes and ambiguities in the regulations that governed the referendum In response  one of the two Downing Street advisers  Stephen Parkinson  said that Vote Leave had adhered to all relevant laws  Mr  Parkinson also suggested that Mr  Sanni was lashing out because the two had  dated for 18 months  before splitting up   I thought amicably   in September 2017  He said he had not spoken to Mr  Sanni as a supervisor from the Vote Leave campaign  but as a friend   That is the capacity in which I gave Shahmir advice and encouragement  and I can understand if the lines became blurred for him   Mr  Parkinson said in the statement   but I am clear that I did not direct the activities of any separate campaign groups  The other adviser  Cleo Watson  could not be reached for comment Mr  Sanni said his relationship with Mr  Parkinson had been a short fling that started after the referendum  In a statement  he said the disclosure of his sexual orientation had endangered his family  who live in Pakistan  and he accused Mr  Parkinson of intimidation  I never imagined that he  with the help of No  10  would choose to tell the world I am gay  in a last  desperate attempt to scare me   Mr  Sanni said His lawyer  Tamsin Allen  said in a statement   We believe this is the first time a Downing Street official statement has been used to out someone  British campaign finance experts said the allegations about Vote Leave underscored the porousness and ineffectiveness of rules on spending around referendums like the vote in 2016 to exit the European Union  They were useless   said Justin Fisher  a professor of political science at Brunel University London who has studied the regulations for the Electoral Commission  which oversees elections and regulates political finance in Britain Multiple organizations  each with its own spending limit  were allowed to campaign in parallel on either side of the referendum issue  and they were allowed to work together in ill defined ways  allowing donors on either side many ways to sidestep spending limits  Mr  Fisher noted The rules  had never really been tested before because we never had a referendum of any consequence before   Mr  Fisher said  noting that in total the supporters of remaining in the European Union had outspent the advocates of leaving Mr  Sanni s allegations have come to light because of a tangle of connections to an online consulting company with ties to the campaign that elected President Trump   Cambridge Analytica Mr  Sanni is friends with Christopher Wylie  a former research director of Cambridge Analytica who has recently provided information to journalists indicating that the company improperly obtained  the data of 50 million Facebook users in order to help target voters The Vote Leave campaign relied heavily for online ad placement on a Canadian company called AggregateIQ  which according to documents and testimony submitted to the Electoral Commission by Mr  Wylie was a satellite business set up to support Cambridge Analytica Public filings also show that Vote Leave provided virtually the entire  990 000 budget of BeLeave   625 000 pounds   which took the form of additional spending paid directly to AggregateIQ As Mr  Wylie was coming forward with his disclosures about Cambridge Analytica  he encouraged his friend Mr  Sanni to come forward with his claims about Vote Leave and BeLeave as well Testimony and documents provided by Mr  Wylie in his filing to the Electoral Commission show that AggregateIQ was founded in 2013 in discussion with executives at Cambridge Analytica s parent company  initially licensed all its software from that company  and for a time received virtually all its income from the company In a statement this week  Jeff Silvester  one of the founders of AggregateIQ  said it was a  digital advertising  web and software development company  and  has never managed  nor did we ever have access to  any Facebook data or database allegedly obtained improperly by Cambridge Analytica  Mr  Silvester did not address the company s work for Vote Leave and BeLeave  A spokesman for Cambridge Analytica did not respond to a request for comment An initial investigation by the Electoral Commission found nothing improper in the relationship between the two organizations  but a court appeal last fall prompted the commission to reopen its inquiry  Mr  Sanni s testimony is additional information recently submitted to that ongoing inquiry He and Mr  Wylie also gave the commission records showing that anyone at Vote Leave continued to have access to the Google Drive used for BeLeave s strategy  planning and internal discussion after the referendum  on June 23  2016 Mr  Sanni graduated from the University of East Anglia at the end of 2015  and began volunteering the next March for the Vote Leave campaign  He worked with a small team of young volunteers in what was then a unit of Vote Leave called BeLeave that tried to craft messages to turn young and liberal people against the European Union by arguing  for example  that it closed doors to the non European world The small BeLeave team initially worked in the same office as Vote Leave and under the oversight of its senior staff  including Mr  Parkinson and Ms  Watson  as did two AggregateIQ employees managing the campaign s online advertising  Mr  Sanni testified to the commission By mid May  however  with the referendum little more than a month away  the Vote Leave campaign was nearing its spending cap At about the same time  the leaders of the Vote Leave campaign instructed their lawyers to draw up a charter for BeLeave to become an independent group  Mr  Sanni was named its secretary and research director while another friend  Darren Grimes  was named its principal and campaign director Mr  Sanni told the commission he was surprised to learn that the leaders of Vote Leave had also decided to direct  900 000 to BeLeave  given that it was overseen by two unpaid  inexperienced people  He and Mr  Grimes were then both 22  But then his friend Mr  Grimes explained that virtually all of that money would be paid directly to AggregateIQ for online advertising In practice  Mr  Sanni said  nothing changed  The BeLeave staff continued to work inside the Vote Leave office  The senior officials of Vote Leave continued to approve their messages  And the same AggregateIQ workers continued to place BeLeave s online advertisements while providing the same service to Vote Leave  We never saw ourselves as a separate organization from the get go   Mr  Sanni said in an interview  echoing his testimony   We were just volunteers  The money paid to AggregateIQ for online advertising produced few results for BeLeave   1 164 email sign ups and 1 005 mobile phone numbers for more than  900 000   leading Mr  Sanni to suspect the money may have gone to promote the larger Vote Leave campaign instead He insisted in the interview that the reason he provided testimony to the commission was not about any past feelings for Mr  Parkinson  now at No  10 Instead  he said  it was out of concern for Mr  Grimes  the other young volunteer  By making Mr  Grimes the nominal owner of BeLeave  the leaders of Vote Leave had made him a target of critical news coverage and potential legal claims  Mr  Sanni argued   He is getting thrown to the dogs   Mr  Sanni said   Everything I am doing is to protect Darren   I now feel sick about what happened   Mr  Sanni said in his testimony  The officials of Vote Leave  used two 22 year olds to cheat in the referendum  Mr  Grimes did not respond to messages seeking comment "

"Perhaps at some point in the past few years you ve told Facebook that you like  say  Kim Kardashian West  When you hit the thumbs up button on her page  you probably did it because you wanted to see the reality TV star s posts in your news feed  Maybe you realized that marketers could target advertisements to you based on your interest in her What you probably missed is that researchers had figured out how to tie your interest in Ms  Kardashian West to certain personality traits  such as how extroverted you are  very   how conscientious  more than most  and how open minded  only somewhat   And when your fondness for Ms  Kardashian West is combined with other interests you ve indicated on Facebook  researchers believe their algorithms can predict the nuances of your political views with better accuracy than your loved ones As The New York Times reported on Saturday  that is what motivated the consulting firm Cambridge Analytica to collect data from more than 50 million Facebook users  without their consent  to build its own behavioral models to target potential voters in various political campaigns  The company has worked for a political action committee started by John R  Bolton  who served in the George W  Bush administration  as well as for President Trump s presidential campaign in 2016   We find your voters and move them to action   the firm boasts on its website Cambridge Analytica now says it has destroyed the user data it collected on Facebook  Raw data reviewed by The Times suggests the information  or copies of it  may still exist  In either case  specific user information was merely a means to an end  a building block in a far more ambitious construction  a behavioral model powerful enough to manipulate people s activity and  potentially  sway elections The firm adapted its approach to personality modeling from studies conducted by researchers at Stanford University and the Psychometrics Center at the University of Cambridge  The studies relied on data collected by a Facebook app called myPersonality  a 100 question quiz developed by the Psychometrics Center that assessed a person s openness  conscientiousness  extroversion  agreeableness and neuroticism  traits commonly referred to in the academic community by the acronym Ocean Many respondents who took the quiz through the myPersonality app authorized it to gain access to their Facebook profile data  and information about their friend network   access that was allowed by the social network at the time  That allowed researchers to cross reference the results of the quiz   numeric Ocean scores   with the users  Facebook  likes   and build a model from the correlations they found between the two  With that model  the researchers could often make precise guesses about subsequent users  personalities using only a list of their likes  no 100 question quiz necessary One of the studies the Psychometrics Center produced  published in 2015 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences  was built on the  likes  and Ocean scores of more than 70 000 respondents who took the myPersonality quiz on Facebook  It found that a person who liked the movie  Fight Club   for example  was far more likely to be open to new experiences than a person who liked  American Idol   according to a review of data provided to The Times by Michal Kosinski  an author of the 2015 study and a professor of organizational behavior at Stanford In that study  the researchers compared the accuracy of their model with personality assessments made by the respondents  friends  The friends were given a 10 question version of the myPersonality quiz and asked to answer based on their knowledge of the respondents  personalities Based on a sample of more than 32 000 participants who were assessed by both the model and one or two friends  the researchers found that the model  using just 10 likes  was more accurate than a work colleague  With 70 likes  it was more accurate than a friend or roommate  with 150  more accurate than a family member  and with 300  more accurate than a spouse The model  the researchers said  was particularly adept at  predicting life outcomes such as substance use  political attitudes and physical health   The real world efficacy of the approach  however  has been called into question When Cambridge Analytica approached the Psychometrics Center about using its models  the center declined  Cambridge Analytica then turned to Aleksandr Kogan  a psychology professor at Cambridge University who was familiar with the center s work  Dr  Kogan developed a Facebook app called  thisisyourdigitallife   a quiz similar to myPersonality  and used it to harvest data from more than 50 million Facebook profiles  Of those  30 million contained enough information to generate personality profiles  Only 270 000 users authorized Dr  Kogan s app to have access to their data  and all were told that their information was being used for academic research Cambridge then pitched its services to potential political and commercial clients  ranging from Mastercard and the New York Yankees to the Joint Chiefs of Staff Facebook has now banned Cambridge Analytica from its platform  as well as its parent company and Dr  Kogan  In Facebook s eyes  Dr  Kogan s infraction was not collecting the data  but giving it to Cambridge Analytica  Although Kogan gained access to this information in a legitimate way and through the proper channels that governed all developers on Facebook at that time  he did not subsequently abide by our rules   Facebook s deputy general counsel said in a statement on Friday By handing over that information to a private company  Facebook said  Dr  Kogan violated its terms of service Facebook in 2015 changed its policies  including altering rules about how third party apps can gain access to information about users  friends  But user data collected through such apps over the years probably remains in the wild  not to mention the models that can continue to be used to target people around the world "
"As Facebook grapples with a backlash over its role in spreading disinformation  an internal dispute over how to handle the threat and the public outcry is resulting in the departure of a senior executive The impending exit of that executive   Alex Stamos  Facebook s chief information security officer   reflects heightened leadership tension at the top of the social network  Much of the internal disagreement is rooted in how much Facebook should publicly share about how nation states misused the platform and debate over organizational changes in the run up to the 2018 midterm elections  according to current and former employees briefed on the matter Mr  Stamos  who plans to leave Facebook by August  had advocated more disclosure around Russian interference of the platform and some restructuring to better address the issues  but was met with resistance by colleagues  said the current and former employees  In December  Mr  Stamos s day to day responsibilities were reassigned to others  they said Mr  Stamos said he would leave Facebook but was persuaded to stay through August to oversee the transition of his responsibilities and because executives thought his departure would look bad  the people said  He has been overseeing the transfer of his security team to Facebook s product and infrastructure divisions  His group  which once had 120 people  now has three  the current and former employees said Mr  Stamos would be the first high ranking employee to leave Facebook since controversy over disinformation on its site  Company leaders   including Mark Zuckerberg  Facebook s chief executive  and Sheryl Sandberg  the chief operating officer   have struggled to address a growing set of problems  including Russian interference on the platform  the rise of false news and the disclosure over the weekend that 50 million of its user profiles had been harvested by Cambridge Analytica  a voter profiling company The developments have taken a toll internally  said the seven people briefed on the matter  who asked not to be identified because the proceedings were confidential  Some of the company s executives are weighing their own legacies and reputations as Facebook s image has taken a beating  Several believe the company would have been better off saying little about Russian interference and note that other companies  such as Twitter  which have stayed relatively quiet on the issue  have not had to deal with as much criticism One central tension at Facebook has been that of the legal and policy teams versus the security team  The security team generally pushed for more disclosure about how nation states had misused the site  but the legal and policy teams have prioritized business imperatives  said the people briefed on the matter  The people whose job is to protect the user always are fighting an uphill battle against the people whose job is to make money for the company   said Sandy Parakilas  who worked at Facebook enforcing privacy and other rules until 2012 and now advises a nonprofit organization called the Center for Humane Technology  which is looking at the effect of technology on people Mr  Stamos said in statement on Monday   These are really challenging issues  and I ve had some disagreements with all of my colleagues  including other executives   On Twitter  he said he was  still fully engaged with my work at Facebook  and acknowledged that his role has changed  without addressing his future plans Facebook did not have a comment on the broader issues around Mr  Stamos s departure Mr  Stamos joined Facebook from Yahoo in June 2015  He and other Facebook executives  such as Ms  Sandberg  disagreed early on over how proactive the social network should be in policing its own platform  said the people briefed on the matter  In his statement  Mr  Stamos said his relationship with Ms  Sandberg was  productive  Mr  Stamos first put together a group of engineers to scour Facebook for Russian activity in June 2016  the month the Democratic National Committee announced it had been attacked by Russian hackers  the current and former employees said By November 2016  the team had uncovered evidence that Russian operatives had aggressively pushed DNC leaks and propaganda on Facebook  That same month  Mr  Zuckerberg publicly dismissed the notion that fake news influenced the 2016 election  calling it a  pretty crazy idea  In the ensuing months  Facebook s security team found more Russian disinformation and propaganda on its site  according to the current and former employees  By the spring of 2017  deciding how much Russian interference to disclose publicly became a major source of contention within the company Mr  Stamos pushed to disclose as much as possible  while others including Elliot Schrage  Facebook s vice president of communications and policy  recommended not naming Russia without more ironclad evidence  said the current and former employees A detailed memorandum Mr  Stamos wrote in early 2017 describing Russian interference was scrubbed for mentions of Russia and winnowed into a blog post last April that outlined  in hypothetical terms  how Facebook could be manipulated by a foreign adversary  they said  Russia was only referenced in a vague footnote  That footnote acknowledged that Facebook s findings did not contradict a declassified January 2017 report in which the director of national intelligence concluded Russia had sought to undermine United States election  and Hillary Clinton in particular Mr  Stamos said in his statement that  we decided that the responsible thing to do would be to make clear that our findings were consistent with those released by the U S  intelligence community  which clearly connected the activity in their report to Russian state sponsored actors  But Facebook s decision to omit Russia backfired  Weeks later  a Time magazine article revealed that Russia had created fake accounts and purchased fake ads to spread propaganda on the platform  allegations that Facebook initially denied By last September  after Mr  Stamos s investigation had revealed further Russian interference  Facebook was forced to reverse course  That month  the company disclosed that beginning in June 2015  Russians had paid Facebook  100 000 to run roughly 3 000 divisive ads to show the American electorate In response  lawmakers like Senator Mark Warner of Virginia  the top Democrat on the intelligence committee  said that although Facebook s revelation was a good first step   I m disappointed it s taken 10 months of raising this issue before they ve become much more transparent  And the revelation also prompted more attention into how Russians had manipulated the social network  Last October and November  Facebook was grilled in front of lawmakers on Capitol Hill for Russian meddling on its platform  along with executives from Twitter and YouTube The public reaction caused some at Facebook to recoil at revealing more  said the current and former employees  Since the 2016 election  Facebook has paid unusual attention to the reputations of Mr  Zuckerberg and Ms  Sandberg  conducting polls to track how they are viewed by the public  said Tavis McGinn  who was recruited to the company last April and headed the executive reputation efforts through September 2017 Mr  McGinn  who now heads Honest Data  which has done polling about Facebook s reputation in different countries  said Facebook is  caught in a Catch 22   Facebook cares so much about its image that the executives don t want to come out and tell the whole truth when things go wrong   he said   But if they don t  it damages their image  Mr  McGinn said he left Facebook after becoming disillusioned with the company s conduct By December 2017  Mr  Stamos  who reports to Facebook s general counsel  proposed that he report directly to higher ups  Facebook executives rejected that proposal and instead reassigned Mr  Stamos s team  splitting the security team between its product team  overseen by Guy Rosen  and infrastructure team  overseen by Pedro Canahuati  according to current and former employees Apart from managing a small team of engineers in San Francisco  Mr  Stamos has largely been left as Facebook s security communicator  Last month  he appeared as Facebook s representative at the Munich Security Conference Over the weekend  after news broke that Cambridge Analytica had harvested data on as many as 50 million Facebook users  Facebook s communications team encouraged Mr  Stamos to tweet in defense of the company  but only after it asked to approve Mr  Stamos s tweets  according to two people briefed on the incident After the tweets set off a furious response  Mr  Stamos deleted them Roger B  McNamee  an early investor in Facebook who said he considered himself a mentor to Mr  Zuckerberg  said the company was failing to face the fundamental problems posed by the Russian meddling

"Each week  Kevin Roose  technology columnist at The New York Times  discusses developments in the tech industry  offering analysis and maybe a joke or two  Want this newsletter in your inbox  Sign up here You know those weeks when crazy things happen at work  your entire schedule goes haywire and the concept of a good night s sleep starts to resemble a hazy and futile dream  like full employment or healthy pizza Well  folks  this was one of those weeks  On Friday night  when Facebook published a blog post saying that it had suspended Cambridge Analytica for misappropriating user data   a post that was intended to pre empt articles by The New York Times and The Observer of London about that very subject  which were published the next day   it became clear that this was a new kind of Facebook privacy scandal  It has already led to congressional inquiries and user revolts  thrusting the company into the kind of chaos it had not seen in its 14 year history On Wednesday  after a five day silence and lots of speculation about his whereabouts  Mark Zuckerberg  Facebook s chief executive  finally re emerged with a Facebook post and an interview with my colleague Sheera Frenkel and me  among others  You can read the transcript of our interview here  and read our article about Facebook s horrible week here We had only about 30 minutes on the phone with Mr  Zuckerberg  but we managed to get him to address several important topics  the Cambridge Analytica mess  Facebook s lax data policies  its plans to clamp down on third party developer access and notify users whose data was misused  election interference  including previously unreported Macedonian attempts to interfere in last year s Alabama special election  and Facebook s broader responsibility as a global power But Mr  Zuckerberg s responses also raised more questions Here  for example  is how he answered a question about Facebook s business model  which is based on selling advertisers and developers the ability to target Facebook users based on their personal data Narrowly  it may be true that being free and ad supported helps Facebook achieve its goals of connecting billions of people to its services  Facebook has developed a number of ways to make itself cheaper and easier to access   including  in some countries  effectively subsidizing use through its Free Basics program  which allows people to use Facebook without its counting toward their data plans But it s not clear this approach has served society well  Especially in countries like Myanmar  where Facebook was recently blamed by United Nations investigators for fueling ethnic violence against the Rohingya  it s possible that having a slightly higher barrier to entry would be a net good  even if it cost Facebook some users in the short term   And it s not even clear that it would  People already pay for their cellphones and data plans all over the world  and might be willing to part with a small fee to keep using their favorite social network  Switching to a subscription model wouldn t fix all of Facebook s problems overnight  There would still be foreign actors trying to interfere in elections  false news and divisive content intending to sway public opinion  and innumerable other issues  But moving away from an ad supported model would make the network harder to exploit   Bot networks are less effective on subscription platforms  for example   And it would lessen the company s incentive to sell out its users  privacy to advertisers Facebook has already shown a willingness to try new models  WhatsApp  for example  makes money by charging businesses for an enterprise product that lets them message their customers  And this week  in an announcement immediately buried by an avalanche of other news about the company  Facebook said it was experimenting with a subscription model that would allow popular creators to charge  5 per month for access to their posts What if all of Facebook cost  5 per month to use  and certain types of divisive and exploitable ad categories and behaviors were removed from the network entirely  Would users revolt en masse  and decide to colonize some other free social media app  Would Facebook collapse without a pipeline of advertising dollars Maybe  But being smaller might not be a bad thing  If we ve learned anything from this year s troubles  it s this  Facebook s platform problems multiply as it gets bigger and more complex  but its ability to deal with those problems stays fairly constant  Zuckerberg might be dedicated to fixing Facebook s problems  but unless he addresses its biggest problem of all   its enormous scale  paired with a business model that requires the company to monetize its users  private data to the greatest extent possible   there s only so much he can do Kevin Roose writes a column called The Shift and is a writer at large for The New York Times Magazine  You can follow him on Twitter here   kevinroose "
"When a former engineer revealed a pattern of sexual harassment at Uber last year  Travis Kalanick  then the company s chief executive  said he would immediately open an investigation When users complained about bugs and problems with the Apple Maps app in 2012  Tim Cook  the company s chief executive  released a statement that said  we fell short  And in 2011  when Netflix tried to split off its mail order DVD business into a company called Qwikster  its chief executive  Reed Hastings  wrote a letter to the public   I messed up   he said   I owe everyone an explanation  But in the past week  as Facebook plunged into a crisis over how Cambridge Analytica  a political consulting firm that provided voter targeting services to the Trump campaign  improperly obtained data on 50 million Facebook users  Mark Zuckerberg  the social network s chief executive  said  well  nothing Neither Mr  Zuckerberg nor Sheryl Sandberg  Facebook s chief operating officer  has made any public appearances this week  Mr  Zuckerberg s last public post on Facebook was a March 2 photo of himself and his wife  Priscilla Chan  baking hamantaschen cookies to celebrate the Jewish holiday of Purim  Ms  Sandberg s most recent post was a four day old photo from her child s debate competition  Updated  Mark Zuckerberg Breaks His Silence  Vows Action to Bolster Data Privacy Facebook employees have described a tense atmosphere in which some joked about selling their stock in the company before it took another dip  The company has lost about  50 billion in market value in the last couple of days  Over the past few months  as criticism of the company s role in the 2016 election has escalated  some employees have sought to transfer to other divisions of the company  such as WhatsApp and Instagram  calling their work on Facebook s main product  demoralizing  On Monday  The New York Times reported that Alex Stamos  the company s chief security officer  was slated to leave the company in August after disagreements with other top executives over the handling of Russia s exploitation of Facebook s platform during the 2016 election season  On Tuesday  Brian Acton  a co founder of WhatsApp  which was acquired by Facebook in 2014 for  19 billion  posted a tweet that read   It is time   deletefacebook   Mr  Acton did not return a request for comment Two people familiar with the matter  who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the discussions were confidential  said that Mr  Zuckerberg planned to address the Cambridge Analytica situation and the larger data privacy issues with a public statement on Wednesday  The statement will be aimed at rebuilding trust with users  one of the people said  In the past week  one of the people said  Mr  Zuckerberg has spent significant time hunkered down with a small group of engineers to discuss how to make Facebook s users more secure  with more control of their data Kate Losse  an early Facebook employee and Mr  Zuckerberg s former speechwriter  said that the Cambridge Analytica controversy was different from previous Facebook privacy scandals  in that it was about an issue at the core of the company s business model that will not be easily remedied  the disclosure of Facebook data to outside sources through its third party developer platform  My guess is that what is giving Zuckerberg pause at this point is the question of how to acknowledge and explain this state of affairs while at the same time mitigating the concerns that will come from people finally understanding how this all worked   she said Mr  Zuckerberg is no stranger to speaking out during times of company crisis  In 2006  users rebelled after Facebook introduced the first version of its news feed  which showed users for the first time what their friends were doing on the social network  As groups formed to protest what they felt was an incursion on their privacy  Mr  Zuckerberg posted a peacemaking note on his Facebook page  Calm down  Breathe  We hear you   he wrote "
"WASHINGTON   Facebook on Sunday faced a backlash about how it protects user data  as American and British lawmakers demanded that it explain how a political data firm with links to President Trump s 2016 campaign was able to harvest private information from more than 50 million Facebook profiles without the social network s alerting users Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota  a Democratic member of the Senate Judiciary Committee  went so far as to press for Mark Zuckerberg  Facebook s chief executive  to appear before the panel to explain what the social network knew about the misuse of its data  to target political advertising and manipulate voters  The calls for greater scrutiny followed reports on Saturday in The New York Times and The Observer of London that Cambridge Analytica  a political data firm founded by Stephen K  Bannon and Robert Mercer  the wealthy Republican donor  had used the Facebook data to develop methods that it claimed could identify the personalities of individual American voters and influence their behavior  The firm s so called psychographic modeling underpinned its work for the Trump campaign in 2016  though many have questioned the effectiveness of its techniques But Facebook did not inform users whose data had been harvested  The lack of disclosure could violate laws in Britain and in many American states Damian Collins  a Conservative lawmaker in Britain who is leading a parliamentary inquiry into fake news and Russian meddling in the country s referendum to leave the European Union  said this weekend that he  too  would call on Mr  Zuckerberg or another top executive to testify  The social network sent executives who handle policy matters to answer questions at an earlier hearing in February  It is not acceptable that they have previously sent witnesses who seek to avoid answering difficult questions by claiming not to know the answers   Mr  Collins said in a statement   This also creates a false reassurance that Facebook s stated policies are always robust and effectively policed  The fallout from the reports added to questions Facebook was already confronting over the use of its platform by those seeking to spread Russian propaganda and fake news  The social media giant has grappled with the criticism over the issue for much of the past year  and struggled to keep public opinion on its side Over the weekend  Facebook was on the defensive  Top executives took to Twitter to argue that the company s protections had not been breached  and that Facebook was thus not at fault  This was unequivocally not a data breach   tweeted Andrew Bosworth  a Facebook executive   No systems were infiltrated  no passwords or information were stolen or hacked  The data was obtained in 2014  when Cambridge Analytica  through an outside researcher  paid users small sums to take a personality quiz and download an app  which would scrape some private information from their profiles and from those of their friends   activity that Facebook permitted at the time  The approach was based on a technique pioneered at Cambridge University by data scientists who claimed it could reveal more about a person than even their parents or romantic partners knew The researcher hired by Cambridge Analytica  Alexandr Kogan  told Facebook and his app s users that he was collecting information for academic purposes  not for a political data firm owned by a wealthy conservative  Facebook did nothing to verify how the information was being used Mr  Bosworth argued on Twitter that a violation had been committed only by Cambridge Analytica and Mr  Kogan  whose app  did not follow the data agreements  Facebook s chief security officer  Alex Stamos  issued a similar defense in a series of tweets that have since been deleted  The recent Cambridge Analytica stories by the NY Times and The Guardian are important and powerful  but it is incorrect to call this a  breach  under any reasonable definition of the term   Mr  Stamos tweeted The explanation did little  however  to stem the tide of anger as independent researchers pointed out that many others could have similarly misused Facebook data  Facebook s platform must protect us from predatory behavior   wrote a Twitter user named Evan Baily   or we can t and shouldn t trust the platform  Jonathan Albright  research director at the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University  wrote that the lack oversight and transparency into what sort of data Facebook collected on its users meant that the company s platform could continue to be exploited  Unethical people will always do bad things when we make it easy for them and there are few   if any   lasting repercussions   Mr  Albright said Paul Grewal  a vice president and deputy general counsel at Facebook  said in a statement that the company was looking into whether the data in question still existed   That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people s information   he said This month  The Times viewed a set of raw data from the profiles Cambridge Analytica obtained  And a former employee of the data firm described having recently seen hundreds of gigabytes of unencrypted data files on Cambridge servers There were also questions from technology experts and others about Facebook s reaction to the news reports by The Times and The Observer  especially its decision to suspend the account of Christopher Wylie  a data expert who oversaw Cambridge Analytica s data harvesting   but also spoke out about it to the two news organizations On Friday  Facebook threatened to sue The Observer to stop it from publishing  the newspaper s outgoing editor  John Mulholland  said on Twitter Then  late Friday evening  Facebook posted a statement that expressed alarm at the data leak  The company promised to take action and announced that it was suspending the accounts of Cambridge Analytica  Mr  Kogan and Mr  Wylie By then  Facebook had learned that Mr  Wylie  who left Cambridge Analytica in 2014  was a named source for the news reports In a statement on Sunday  Mr  Wylie described himself as  a curious and naïve 23 year old   when he first went to work for Cambridge Analytica  I feel a sense of regret every day when I see where they have helped take our world   he added   I need to make amends  and that s why I m coming forward  His lawyer  Tamsin Allen  said that last week Mr  Wylie offered to help Facebook recover the missing data Now  though  Facebook said on Sunday  Mr  Wylie is refusing to cooperate with the company until the suspension is lifted   a move the social network is not willing to make because of his role in the data harvesting In both Britain and the United States  lawmakers said that in the light of the new reports  they wanted fresh answers from both Facebook and Cambridge Analytica about how the data was obtained and what was done with it Mr  Collins  the British lawmaker  said he planned to call Alexander Nix  the chief executive of Cambridge Analytica  to return to Parliament and answer questions about testimony last month in which he claimed that the company never obtained or used Facebook data  It seems clear that he has deliberately misled the committee and Parliament   Mr  Collins said In the United States  the attorney general of Massachusetts  Maura Healey  announced on Saturday that her office was opening an investigation   Massachusetts residents deserve answers immediately from Facebook and Cambridge Analytica   she said in a Twitter post that linked to the Times article Also on Saturday  the two top Congressional Democrats leading inquiries into Russian interference in the 2016 election   Senator Mark Warner of Virginia and Representative Adam Schiff of California   called for investigations of the Facebook data leak  This raises serious questions about the level of detail that Cambridge Analytica knew about users   said Mr  Schiff  who is the ranking Democrat on the House intelligence committee "
"In 2007  a young Mark Zuckerberg stood on a stage in San Francisco and announced that Facebook was throwing open its doors No longer  he said  would Facebook be a closed off software product like every other social network  Instead  it would become an open platform and invite outside developers to build apps and programs on top of it  We want to make Facebook into something of an operating system   Mr  Zuckerberg told a reporter At the time  the announcement drew little notice outside the programming world  Developers quickly went to work making fun and quirky apps that plugged into Facebook   early hits included  Rendezbook   a kind of proto Tinder that allowed users to match with each other for  random flings   and CampusRank  which allowed college students to nominate their peers for yearbook type awards Later  popular games like FarmVille arrived  and apps like Tinder and Spotify began allowing their users to log in using their Facebook credentials  In some ways  it was a fair trade  Facebook got to weave itself more deeply into users  internet habits  and the outside app developers got access to a big audience and valuable data about their users  In all  millions of apps have been created with Facebook s open platform tools Through it all  Facebook s users were mostly unfazed  Sure  these apps collected data about their lives  But they seemed convenient and harmless  and  really  what could go wrong Today  more than a decade later  the consequences of Facebook s laissez faire approach are becoming clear  Over the weekend  The New York Times reported that Cambridge Analytica  a British consulting firm  improperly acquired the private data of about roughly 50 million Facebook users  and used it to target voters on behalf of the Trump campaign during the 2016 presidential election What happened with Cambridge Analytica wasn t technically a data breach  since this trove of personal information wasn t stolen from Facebook s servers  Rather  it was given away freely to the maker of a Facebook personality quiz app called  thisisyourdigitallife  That app  which was developed by a University of Cambridge professor  collected data about the 270 000 people who installed it  along with data about their Facebook friends  totaling 50 million people in all  The professor  Aleksandr Kogan  then gave the data he had harvested to Cambridge Analytica Technically  only this last step violated Facebook s rules  which prohibit selling or giving away data collected by a third party app  The rest was business as usual  Third party apps collect vast amounts of detailed personal information about Facebook users every day  including their ages  location  pages they ve liked and groups they belong to  Users can opt out of sharing specific pieces of information  but it s unclear how many do This kind of broad data collection is not only allowed but encouraged by Facebook  which wants to keep developers happily building on top of its platform  Permissiveness is a feature  as they say  not a bug But in the wake of incidents like the data leak to Cambridge Analytica  some are questioning the costs of such loose policies on an influential platform with 2 2 billion registered users  It seems insane that you can make haphazard decisions about so many people s data   said Can Duruk  a technology consultant and software engineer  Facebook  he said  was  extremely lax with what kind of data they allowed people to get  In a Facebook post on Monday  Andrew Bosworth  a Facebook vice president  admitted that that thinking may have been a mistake  We thought that every app could be social   Mr  Bosworth wrote   Your calendar should have your events and your friends birthdays  your maps should know where your friends live  your address book should show their pictures  It was a reasonable vision but it didn t materialize the way we had hoped  An early clue about the potential for misuse of Facebook s third party developer tools came in 2010 when my colleague Emily Steel  then at The Wall Street Journal  reported that an online tracking company  RapLeaf  was collecting and reselling data it had gathered from third party Facebook apps to marketing firms and political consultants  In response  Facebook cut off RapLeaf s data access and said it would  dramatically limit  the misuse of its users  personal information by outside parties But preventing data hungry developers from exploiting Facebook s treasure trove of personal information remained challenging  In 2015  Facebook removed the ability of third party developers to collect detailed information about the friends of users who had installed an app  citing privacy concerns   Cambridge Analytica s data trove  which included this type of information  was gathered in 2014  before the change   Facebook has also taken away tools used by developers to create games and quizzes that barraged users with annoying notifications But the core functions of Facebook s open platform tool are still intact  There are still many third party apps like  thisisyourdigitallife  out there  vacuuming up intimate data about Facebook users  That data doesn t disappear  and Facebook has no real recourse to stop it from falling into the wrong hands Not all open data access is used irresponsibly  Researchers and nongovernmental organizations have used Facebook s third party development tools to respond to natural disasters  And many of the functions that internet users depend on   for example  the ability to import their digital address books into a new messaging app   are possible thanks only to the tools that allow for third party development known as application programming interfaces  or A P I s  Everything we depend on uses A P I s   said Kin Lane  a software engineer who maintains a website called API Evangelist   They re in your home  in your business  in your car  It s how these platforms innovate and do cool  interesting things  In Facebook s case  permissive data policies were also good for business  Third party developers built millions of apps on top of Facebook s platform  giving Facebook users more reasons to spend time on the site and generating more ad revenue for the company  Restricting access to data would limit Facebook s usefulness to developers and could drive them to build on a rival platform instead  making those products better In this context  it s even less surprising that Dr  Kogan and Cambridge Analytica were able to use a silly personality quiz to collect information about millions of Americans  After all  why else would the quiz be there "

"Good Thursday Here s what we re watching   Tariffs will test investors  resolve   Trump on Tariffs   If they charge us  we charge them    The stock market is proving Gary D  Cohn right   China tech stocks are also tumbling  Dropbox has priced its I P O Get this in your inbox each morning  Sign up here An unorthodox action by President Trump unsettles investors  but after a freakout  their optimism returns and the stock market moves higher But will investors shrug off President Trump s tariffs on China The stock market plunged Thursday after Mr  Trump announced the measures against China  Since mid February  when the Trump administration laid out its case for steel and aluminum tariffs  the S  P  500 is down 3 2 percent  The Dow Jones industrial average is off nearly 5 percent Until now  investors might have thought they could take Mr  Trump s trade pronouncements in stride  After all  many countries have won a reprieve from the steel and aluminum tariffs  And as Edward Alden of the Council on Foreign Relations wrote Thursday of the anti China measures   The administration is delaying the action to solicit comments from affected U S  companies  and it is quite possible the final tariffs will fall short of the threats  Just as the Trump administration has stepped back from quickly imposing the steel and aluminum tariffs  it may soften its stance if China suggests that its open to negotiations  The world could relax But China may not budge  As our colleague Steven Lee Myers reports  President Xi Jinping has so far managed to navigate Mr  Trump s rhetoric while maintaining a strong nationalist image at home  Yet Mr  Trump s tariff announcement  along with moves perceived by the Chinese as humiliating  may prompt China to retaliate with force Investors would then scramble to quantify the economic repercussions  They might not be terrible Some American companies  like computer chip makers  get substantial revenue from China  But on average  companies in the S  P  500 index derive a small share of their sales from the country And some investors may take a long view  believing that U S  companies have long been treated unfairly in China  A trade fight that eventually relaxes some of those disadvantageous conditions could bolster the long term prospects of those firms  And if the U S  is able to recruit other countries to its cause  China may relent Still  much could go wrong  A true test of investor sentiment will come if China fights back  Markets could fall further  creating a financial chain reaction that dampens the wider economy  A lot would depend on how Mr  Trump responds to Chinese actions  Would he up the ante  It s genuinely hard to predict how this will turn out   said Scott Kennedy  an expert in Chinese trade at the Center for Strategic and International Studies   whether one side will back down or whether it will spiral into a trade war    Peter EavisHere are the details   The data storage and collaboration company sold 36 million shares at  21 apiece  its expected range of  18 to  20 a share   At that price  the offering raised  756 million   At  21 a share  the company has a market value of gave Dropbox a market value of  9 2 billion The contextThe demand for Dropbox s shares suggests investors overcame any concern about daunting competition from the likes of Microsoft  Google and Amazon  all of which provide cloud storage services  A successful debut could pave the way for other unicorns to soon go public President Trump said he would impose about  60 billion worth of annual tariffs on Chinese imports as the White House moved to punish China for what it says is a pattern of co opting American technology and trade secrets and robbing companies of jobs and billions of dollars in revenue The tariffs will target 1 300 lines of Chinese goods   everything from shoes and clothing to electronics   the NYT reports administration officials said Mr  Trump  the officials added  will also direct the Treasury Department to impose restrictions on Chinese investment in American technology companies  a practice that they said the Chinese government uses to develop its own  national champions  in cutting edge industries like A I  and autonomous vehicles  The end objective of this is to get China to modify its unfair trade practices   Everett Eissenstat  the deputy director of the National Economic Council  told reporters Peter Navarro  the director of the White House National Trade Council and an architect of the measures  cast the tariffs as part of a seminal shift in how the U S  views China  Rather than trying to draw it into the rules based international economic order   a policy that dates back to Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger   the U S  now regards China as a strategic competitor  bent on eroding American security and prosperity   Mark Landler and Jim TankersleyBefore he said he was leaving his White House position earlier this month  Mr  Cohn reportedly warned that protectionist trade policies could jeopardize the stock rally that has taken place since Donald Trump became president  After Mr  Trump announced tariffs on steel and aluminum  the stock market slid  but soon recovered those losses  reassuring the president that his decision to introduce tariffs was right On Thursday  the Trump administration announced trade restrictions against China  The news appeared to weigh on markets  So  how have stocks done since important dates in the trade skirmish One important milestone was the Commerce Department s announcement last month that suggested the Trump administration was serious about introducing steel and aluminum tariffs  The S  P  500 index is down 2 3 percent since the day before that announcement  Mr  Trump actually announced plans for those tariffs on March 1  The S  P  500 is down 1 7 percent since Feb  28 The Dow Jones industrial average has done a lot worse  however  It is down 3 7 percent since the Commerce Department s announcement  and 3 1 percent since Mr  Trump announced his intentions  The decline encapsulated how trade tension might hurt specific businesses  in particular  Boeing s   Peter EavisMuch of the Dow s underperformance can be traced to the aircraft maker s stock The Trump administration s trade policies have hit Boeing  the most heavily weighted stock in the Dow  particularly hard Aluminum makes up about 80 percent of the weight of most commercial aircrafts  according to Brooke Sutherland and David Fickling of Gadfly  That means tariffs on imported aluminum would likely raise Boeing s costs more than its competitors  Boeing also views China  the main target of the Trump administration s protectionist trade policies  as an important growth market  The country is set to overtake the U S  as the biggest aviation market by 2022  Ms  Sutherland and Mr  Fickling write China could target Boeing if the country decides to retaliate against the U S Boeing is down 3 6 percent today  shaving more than 80 points off the blue chip index  Since the Commerce Department released its report calling for tariffs on imported steel and aluminum  the stock is down 8 7 percent  worth more than 200 points off the Dow Boeing drove the Dow higher for much of Mr  Trump s presidency  more than doubling during his first 12 months in office Boeing s climb has had an outsized impact on the Dow  The index is price weighted  meaning that the higher priced stocks have a bigger pull on the index MoneyBeat s Ben Eisen noted that at the end of January  the stock accounted for 9 4 percent of Dow  up from 6 percent a year earlier  By comparison  Boeing makes up just 0 8 percent of the market capitalization weighted S  P  500 Chinese tech stocks are also tumbling Shares of Alibaba are off 4 2 percent  Tencent 5 percent and Baidu 4 3 percent in the wake of the Trump administration s plan to impose about  60 billion worth of annual tariffs on Chinese imports That is much worse than their American counterparts  Amazon  Facebook and Google s parent Alphabet are down between 1 2 percent and 2 2 percent by comparison Shares of Baidu  Alibaba and Tencent   collectively known as BAT   have soared over the past year  pushing their combined market value above  1 trillion As these companies have grown  so have their ambitions  All three have moved to expand beyond their core business and home market and have aggressively invested in Americantech start ups to help them do so China s largest internet companies   the BAT plus the e commerce company JD com   have invested  5 6 billion in 48 tech deals in the United States over the past two years  according to CBI Insights data via CNBC Such investments have raised concerns in the United States  The Trump administration officials said the Chinese government uses these investments to develop its own  national champions  in cutting edge industries like A I  and autonomous vehicles  As part of the China tariffs  the Trump administration plans to place restrictions on Chinese investment in American technology companies Shrugging off hikes by the Federal Reserve and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority this week  the Bank of England maintained its key interest rate at 0 5 percent today Two members of the central bank s monetary policy committee called for an immediate rate increase  but the majority of the committee did not see the need for a hike at this time  Most economists expect the Bank of England to raise rates in May  when it releases its latest quarterly projection for inflation In the minutes from the committee s latest meeting  the central bank said that there had been  few surprises  in recent economic data and its February projections for inflation appeared  broadly on track   The bank said that the May inflation report would allow the committee to  undertake a fuller assessment of the underlying momentum in the economy  the degree of slack remaining and the extent of domestic inflationary pressures    Chad BrayAfter days of questions and criticism about his silence  the Facebook co founder and C E O  posted a statement and gave a

would love to see    He also made ad transparency promises to Wired    To the NYT  about Facebook s business model   I don t think the ad model is going to go away  because I think fundamentally  it s

"When the Russia question came up during a hearing at the British Parliament last month  Alexander Nix did not hesitate  We ve never worked in Russia   said Mr  Nix  head of a data consulting firm that advised the Trump campaign on targeting voters  As far as I m aware  we ve never worked for a Russian company   Mr  Nix added   We ve never worked with a Russian organization in Russia or any other country  and we don t have any relationship with Russia or Russian individuals  But Mr  Nix s business did have some dealings with Russian interests  according to company documents and interviews Mr  Nix is a director of SCL Group  a British political and defense contractor  and chief executive of its American offshoot  Cambridge Analytica  which advised the Trump campaign  The firms  employees  who often overlap  had contact in 2014 and 2015 with executives from Lukoil  the Russian oil giant Lukoil was interested in how data was used to target American voters  according to two former company insiders who said there were at least three meetings with Lukoil executives in London and Turkey  SCL and Lukoil denied that the talks were political in nature  and SCL also said there were no meetings in London The contacts took place as Cambridge Analytica was building a roster of Republican clients in the United States   and harvesting the Facebook profiles of over 50 million users to develop tools to analyze voters  behavior Cambridge Analytica also included extensive questions about Russia s president  Vladimir V  Putin  in surveys it was carrying out in American focus groups in 2014  It is not clear what   or which client   prompted the line of questioning  which asked for views on topics ranging from Mr  Putin s popularity to Russian expansionism On two promotional documents obtained by The New York Times  SCL said it did business in Russia  In both documents  the country is highlighted on world maps that specify the location of SCL clients  with one of the maps noting that the clients were for the firm s elections division  In a statement  SCL said an employee had done  commercial work  about 25 years ago  for a private company in Russia  Cambridge Analytica has been a political flash point since its role in the Trump campaign attracted scrutiny after the election  While Mr  Nix s firm turned over some records to the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence during its investigation of Russian interference  Democrats on the committee want a fuller review   It is imperative to interview a broader range of individuals employed by or linked to Cambridge Analytica   they said in a report this month Asked about the Russian oil company  a spokesman for SCL said that in 2014 the firm s commercial division  discussed helping Lukoil Turkey better engage with its loyalty card customers at gas stations   The spokesman said SCL was not ultimately hired Arash Repac  chief executive of Lukoil Eurasia Petrol  offered a different explanation for the talks  He said that a meeting he attended with SCL in Turkey involved a promotional campaign with local soccer teams  We needed somebody to guide us with the customer data that we were collecting   he wrote in response to a question from The Times   Even though our campaign went ahead  we decided not to cooperate with SCL  No contracts were signed  But Christopher Wylie  who helped found Cambridge Analytica and develop the company s voter profiling technology  said Lukoil showed interest in how the company used data to tailor messaging to American voters  I remember being super confused   said Mr  Wylie  who took part in one of the Lukoil meetings  I kept asking Alexander   Can you explain to me what they want    he said  referring to Mr  Nix   I don t understand why Lukoil wants to know about political targeting in America   We re sending them stuff about political targeting   they then come and ask more about political targeting   Mr  Wylie said  adding that Lukoil  just didn t seem to be interested  in how the techniques could be used commercially Mr  Wylie  a former contractor  left SCL before the talks concluded and could not say what became of the relationship with the oil company  He had a falling out with SCL and tried to set up a rival business  SCL said he had violated a nondisclosure agreement and that his comments were an attempt to hurt the company A second person familiar with the discussions backed up Mr  Wylie s account  but spoke on the condition of anonymity because of a confidentiality agreement Though Lukoil is not state owned  it depends on Kremlin support  and its chief executive  Vagit Alekperov  has met with Mr  Putin on a number of occasions  Reuters reported last year that Lukoil and other companies received instructions from the state energy ministry on providing news stories favorable to Russian leadership "
" Good Monday  Here s what we re watching   Facebook s stock slides as lawmakers want answers on the latest controversy   Mark Zuckerberg is on the hot seat following the Cambridge Analytica revelations   Congress is racing to complete its spending bill   U S  companies warn President Trump about sweeping tariffs Get this in your inbox every morning  Sign up here Larry Ellison is the founder of Oracle and the 10th richest man on the planet  according to Forbes  Dr  David Agus is a best selling author and physician whose clients included Steve Jobs and Sumner Redstone Of all the companies the two could have started together  they ve chosen an unusual approach  a hydroponic farming start up focused on creating more healthful food Their new business  Sensei  formally unveiled itself Monday afternoon  wading into an industry that has become increasingly popular among investors Silicon Valley Start up Plenty raised  200 million from SoftBank s  100 billion Vision Fund  Bowery Farming  whose vegetables are now sold in a few grocery stores in New York City  has collected money from the likes of Google s venture arm and General Catalyst Sensei is focused more on wellness  While the company ultimately plans to expand into an array of businesses  its initial focus is on hydroponic farming  using software and sensors to monitor growing conditions   Its first farm is on Lanai  the Hawaiian island of which Mr  Ellison owns roughly 98 percent  Sensei s first batch of crops includes Black Trifele tomatoes and Komatsuna mustard greens  with its yardstick for production being nutrition per acre  So far  the conversation in agriculture has been dominated by productivity  How much food can we grow in a square foot  But scale is just part of the equation   Dr  Agus said in a statement   To properly nourish the world  we need to consider how nutritious that food is  This is where Sensei is focused  Its first customer is Hawaii  which imports the majority of its food  Sensei said that it can provide the state fresh food within 24 hours of harvesting  compared with over a week for imported vegetables But the company is also eager to tout its tech bona fides  Its farm runs off solar power provided by Tesla panels  And it claims to use just 10 percent of the water used in traditional farming methods  For so long  agriculture has been one of the least digitized industries   Daniel Gruneberg  Sensei s president  said in a statement   Now  we can combine software  sensors and robotics to make giant leaps in sustainable farming and perhaps  more importantly  the quality of our food    Michael de la MercedFacebook s stock had its worst day in about four years Shares of the social media giant finished down about 7 percent after the NYT reported that a political data firm with ties to 2016 Trump campaign harvested private information from over 50 million user profiles The news reports raised the specter of greater government scrutiny and potential regulatory action toward the technology sector  Already  government officials in the United States  Europe and elsewhere have been demanding tougher oversight of the world s largest tech companies  That  in turn  could erode the industry s profits and potentially force some companies to adjust their business models Facebook s stock is now down more than 12 percent from its all time high hit at the start of February  We think this episode is another indication of systemic problems at Facebook   said Brian Wieser  an analyst at New York based brokerage Pivotal Research Group Facebook s woes showed signs of spreading  too The S  P  500 tech sector is the worst performing of the index s 11 sectors Shares of Google parent Alphabet closed down about 3 2 percent  Amazon fell around 1 7 percent and Apple finished off 1 5 percent In all  Monday s slide wiped more than  80 billion off the market value of Facebook  Amazon  Netflix and Alphabet  Facebook accounted for more than  35 billion of that total  In fact  the company is no longer among the five biggest companies in the S  P  500 by market capitalization Fund flows added fuel to the selloff  MoneyBeat s Akane Otani reports that mutual funds and exchange traded funds tracking U S  technology stocks posted a record  2 6 billion in net inflows last week  according to data from fund tracker EPFR Global  That put year to date inflows at  47 5 billion Given the outsized role the tech sector has played in the aging bull market  its declines Monday dragged down the broader stock indexes The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 336 points  or 1 35 percent  while the S  P  500  was off nearly 39 points  or 1 42 percent Is Mark Zuckerberg s unusually powerful position at Facebook in part to blame for the latest backlash against the company The giant social media company is under the spotlight because a political data firm apparently misused information about more than 50 million Facebook users  Facebook is still facing questions about Russia linked accounts that had significant reach within the United States through the social network  In both cases  Facebook has struggled to show the public that it can get in front of its problems  Information about the Russia linked accounts came out piecemeal  and Facebook knew as early as 2015 that the political data firm had violated its data policies Mr  Zuckerberg at first downplayed concerns about Facebook s role in the 2016 presidential election  something he later said he regretted   His recent communications contain more high minded deliberation than hard discussion of the company s problems and how to deal with them These look like the reactions of a leader who thinks he is not going anywhere  Indeed  through his holding of special voting shares  Mr  Zuckerberg has an especially powerful position at Facebook that might shield him from the normal forces of accountability  C E O s without that protection might do more to tackle a big problem because it more directly threatens their job security Facebook  of course  has taken steps to address the abuse of its network  It has added hundreds of new employees to help police posts  and it has implemented artificial intelligence technology to spot material that falls afoul of the company s guidelines  Such initiatives cost money  Mr  Zuckerberg earlier this year said that such initiatives would have a significant impact on Facebook s profitability  Indeed  there s a strong argument to make that Mr  Zuckerberg s protected position will allow the company to press ahead with expensive investments in the face of any shareholder grumbling that may arise In the near term  though  it s hard to envision shareholders applying significant pressure on Facebook to be more responsive to the political and legal risks  They may believe Facebook s extraordinary profitability   its operating profits are roughly equivalent to 40 percent of its revenue   will help the stock ride what they see as a passing storm If governments propose restrictions on using members  data  Facebook s business model would be tested  The company s board  in theory  should press Mr  Zuckerberg for details on how he will deal with such shackles  But prominent board members like Marc L  Andreessen and Peter A  Thiel are skeptical of regulation  Facebook might be tempted to fight back Lawmakers may hold the line  however  sensing that the public has real concerns about the company  And if Facebook s responses look tardy and inadequate  the consequences could be harsh  as the fate of Wells Fargo  shows  Mr  Zuckerberg  in his uniquely dominant position  is the one person who can make sure this doesn t happen   Peter EavisLawmakers in the U S  and Britain want Mark Zuckerberg to explain how Cambridge Analytica  the political data firm founded by Steve Bannon and Robert Mercer  harvested private information from over 50 million user profiles  It s clear these platforms can t police themselves   tweeted Senator Amy Klobuchar  a Democratic member of the Senate Judiciary Committee What happened  The NYT and The Observer of London reported how Cambridge had collected data from an outside researcher to better target Facebook users  Christopher Wylie  who oversaw Cambridge s data collection until 2014  told the NYT of his former company   For them  this is a war  and it s all fair  Facebook argued that the incident wasn t a data breach and that Cambridge had committed a violation  But former Federal Trade Commission officials told the WaPo that Facebook may have violated a privacy pact reached with the regulator   The tech giant is reviewing whether one of its employees had been aware of the data leak  More on Cambridge Analytica  Alexander Nix  the company s chief  is facing scrutiny over business dealings with Russian interests  Mr  Wylie said that one Russian company  the oil giant Lukoil  appeared more interested in political message targeting than commercial uses  And Cambridge is reportedly trying to block the airing of a report by Channel 4  a British television channel  in which reporters went undercover at the firm Critic s cornerJeffrey Goldfarb of Breakingviews writes A woman in Tempe  Ariz   has died after being hit by a self driving car operated by Uber  in what appears to be the first known death of a pedestrian struck by an autonomous vehicle on a public road The Uber vehicle was in autonomous mode with a human safety driver at the wheel when it struck the woman  who was crossing the street outside of a crosswalk  the Tempe police said in a statement  The episode happened on Sunday around 10 p m  The woman was not publicly identified Uber said it had suspended testing of its self driving cars in Tempe  Pittsburgh  San Francisco and Toronto  Our hearts go out to the victim s family  We are fully cooperating with local authorities in their investigation of this incident   an Uber spokeswoman  Sarah Abboud  said in a statement The fatal crash will most likely raise questions about regulations for self driving cars  Testing of self driving cars is already underway for vehicles that have a human driver ready to take over if something goes wrong  but states are starting to allow companies to test cars without a person in the driver s seat  This month  California said that  in April  it would start allowing companies to test autonomous vehicles without anyone behind the wheel   Daisuke WakabayashiThe newspaper publisher announced Monday that Michael W  Ferro Jr   a Chicago entrepreneur and its biggest shareholder  has stepped down as the company s chairman  The move came just weeks after Mr  Ferro helped negotiate the sale of Tronc s crown jewel  The Los Angeles Times Justin Dearborn  the company s chief executive  will replace Mr  Ferro as chairman  I am confident that under the leadership of Justin and the rest of the board and management team Tronc will continue to deliver value for investors while executing the plan for digital transformation   Mr  Ferro said in a statement Mr  Ferro will remain an investor in Tronc  But his decision to step down as chairman follows a period of intense public scrutiny   Sydney EmberThe Long Term Stock Exchange hoping to popularize long term thinking as a corporate governance strategy has taken another step toward making its goal a reality The start up disclosed today that its partner  the IEX stock exchange  has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to let it apply its listing rules to the IEX The filing   which will commence the public part of the S E C  s review of the rule changes at IEX   advances the LTSE s aim of enshrining what it believes are best practices in running companies into corporate charters If the S E C approves the rules  it means that companies can go public using the LTSE principles  but also have their stocks trade on traditional exchanges like the N Y S E  and the Nasdaq like any other listing  That means these companies can get the liquidity they need along with the corporate governance structure that they want  according to the LTSE s founder  Eric Ries It also formalizes a tie up between LTSE and IEX  the exchange best known as the subject of Michael Lewis s  Flash Boys  What the principles include  Letting so called  citizens   or investors who plan on sticking with companies for the long term  eventually accumulate more voting power over the years than  tourists  who plan on sticking around for a shorter time   Blocking the use of certain kinds of compensation  including short term bonuses paid to executives based on metrics like reaching a certain milestone for quarterly earnings   Banning short term guidance   Having long term investors register their holdings with the company   The company will know effectively in real time who their long term investors are   Mr  Ries said   Reporting requirements that include disclosing earnings per share net of buybacks  to provide a more accurate way of measuring how a company is doing without factoring in financial engineering The context  Mr  Ries has spoken of the need to reward long term investors   Most of the listing standards are designed to align managers and long term shareholders   he told me   That frees up management to do what s right    It comes as companies continue to bemoan short term thinking in the stock markets that has C E O s focused more on meeting a quarter s targets than longer term goals   LTSE s goal is to eventually become a stock exchange on which companies list their shares  But for now  it wants to be allowed to create a special kind of listing for IEX that lets companies go public under its principles   LTSE also plans to promote itself as serving companies first and foremost and to make money more from listing fees and tools and services for its companies  rather than from trading offerings and data aimed at investors The caveatIt s a long road ahead  Not just for the rule change process  but also in convincing start ups to adopt these rules when they go public  What we have promised our venture investors is not that this is going to instantly transform the market overnight   Mr  Ries said   Michael de la MercedFriday is the deadline for lawmakers to pass a budget  and they are considering a plan that would cost more than  1

"Good Monday  Here s what we re watching   Best day for stocks in nearly three years   A reality check on the White House s tariff tactics   Tim Cook and other C E O s took shots at Facebook   Eddie Lampert finally speaks about Sears   Washington and Beijing hold trade talks Get this in your inbox each morning  Sign up here Stocks on Wall Street surged on signs of easing trade tensions The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 669 points  or 2 8 percent  the S  P  500 surged 2 7 percent and the tech heavy Nasdaq Composite climbed 3 3 percent It was the largest one day point gain for the Dow since October 2008  according to The WSJ  and the biggest one day percentage gain for S  P  500 and Dow since August 2015 Worries that the Trump administration s protectionist policies could ignite a trade war between the world s two largest economies punished equities last week  American stocks endured their worst week in two years as the Dow lost 1 400 points  or 5 7 percent Tensions seemed to relax over the weekend  The WSJ reported late Sunday that  China and the U S  have quietly started negotiating to improve U S  access to Chinese markets   Also  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in an interview that he s  cautiously hopeful  that China will reach a deal to avoid tariffs Shares jumped at the open and the momentum gained through the day as last week s hardest hit sectors led the way   The S  P  500 technology sector rose 4 percent  Microsoft and Apple gained 7 6 percent and 4 8 percent  respectively   The KBW Bank Index climbed 3 percent on Monday  after tumbling 8 percent last week  Bank of America finished up 4 4 percent  while Morgan Stanley gained 4 3 percent  The two stocks had fallen nearly 5 percent on Friday   Even Facebook  which was down 6 5 percent earlier in the day from the continued fallout from the Cambridge Analytica scandal  was able to eek out gains  The stock finished up 0 4 percent higher   Gun stocks were the exception  Shares of publicly traded firearms companies fell in the wake Remington Outdoor bankruptcy filing and this weekend rallies for gun control  American Outdoor Brands fell 2 3 percent  Vista Outdoor dropped 3 8 percent and Sturm  Ruger   Co  slipped less than 1 percent Investors last week looked at President Trump s tariffs against Chinese products and seemed to conclude that he was taking the U S  into a trade war with China  The stock market plunged 6 percent Perhaps eager to stop the rout  the White House on Monday had a less confrontational message  Mr  Trump is applying one of his negotiating tactics  According to this view  the tariff proposal was a jarring move partly aimed at getting China to see that the U S  was serious about wanting to make trade with China fairer From a CNBC interview with Kevin Hassett  the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers Mr  Hassett s comments were in response to a WSJ article reporting that China and the U S  were quietly engaged in trade negotiations Investors seemed somewhat relieved  The stock market was up 1 5 percent on Monday  Of course  if the stakes are small enough  a deal may get done in the coming months that allows both sides to claim victory  But it seems unlikely that China would quickly agree to a far reaching overhaul of the rules that govern foreign investment in the country  a major area of dispute  Our colleagues Raymond Zhong and Paul Mozur showed the depth of the divide there Mr  Trump could up the ante if China shows no real signs that it will open up considerably  That could roil the markets again  The White House may want to signal that it can take market turmoil in stride  Mr  Hassett on Monday seemed to say that the White House expects market sell offs as it pursues its trade agenda  Rising risk premiums means investors require a better return on their stocks and bonds to cover higher risks  This usually involves a decline in price to make their returns look better to prospective buyers  Still  the more conciliatory tone from the White House after the sell off suggests there is not a strong desire for a full on trade war   Peter EavisThe stock is down 6 5 percent Monday morning as the Federal Trade Commission confirmed that it has opened an investigation into Facebook s privacy practice Also on Monday  Senator Chuck Grassley  Republican of Iowa and chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee  invited Mr  Zuckerberg to testify about privacy standards next month and also extended the invitation to Google s chief executive  Sundar Pichai  and Twitter s chief executive  Jack Dorsey Facebook s shares are down nearly 22 percent since its high in early February and off more than 18 percent since the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke more than a week ago To put Facebook s recent tumble in perspective  The stock is set for its worst monthly performance since August 2012  Over the past 10 days  Facebook has lost  100 billion in market value Despite the fall  Wall Street has not soured on Facebook  Forty four analysts have buy ratings on the stock  compare to just two who have sell ratings  according to Bloomberg The Apple C E O  said at the China Development Forum in Beijing that the government should tighten privacy regulations  after last week s revelations about Facebook and Cambridge Analytica Apple often uses privacy as a selling point  but Mr  Cook wasn t the only critic  Elon Musk deleted SpaceX and Tesla s Facebook pages  saying that the Tesla one  looks lame anyway   Sir Martin Sorrell of the ad giant WPP said Facebook needed to  step up to the mark  and be responsible for content on its platform  And some companies have stopped buying ads on Facebook  highlighting how advertisers want more transparency about performance   Users also complained that the Android app tracked calls and text messages  Meanwhile  Facebook took out full page ads in several British and American newspapers   including the NYT   for an apology

"Good Tuesday  Here s what we re watching    What to expect from Powell s first Fed meeting   Trump  tariffs and the G20   Pressure continues to mount on Facebook   Facebook had a terrible day   So did Uber   Leaders at the G 20 summit are still trying to avert a trade war Get this in your inbox each morning  Sign up here Federal Reserve policymakers conclude their March rate setting meeting on Wednesday  It is the first such session with Jerome H  Powell as the central bank s new chairman With the job market tight and inflation picking up only gradually  the Fed is widely expected to raise rates by a quarter of a percentage point in what is likely to be the first of three rate increases this year After the meeting  Mr  Powell will hold his first news conference in his new role  where observers will be listening closely for any suggestion that the Fed might depart from its anticipated path  and  if so  why Here s a look at what economists and money managers are expecting Jan Hatzius  Goldman Sachs   Public remarks by Fed officials suggest a broad shift in the committee s outlook towards a potentially faster pace of tightening  and we expect the median dot to show four hikes in 2018  up from three at the December meeting  Additional hawkish changes a move to three hikes in 2019 or an increase in the longer run funds rate estimates are also possible but not our base case  Michelle Meyer  Bank of America Merrill Lynch  Ms  Meyer says she expects the Fed raise rates this meeting  but  unlike December where there were two dissents  we expect this decision to be unanimous given the shift in voters this year in the hawkish direction  The focus will be on the evolution of the dots  we look for the median to hold at three hikes for this year  but to shift up from two to three hikes in 2019  We also think the long run dot will edge up to 2 875   This would show a Fed that is more confident about its ability to deliver rate hikes  but without an urgency to front load the tightening  Ian Shepherdson  Pantheon Macroeconomics  Mr  Powell  is bound to be faced with questions along the lines of  Why are you not raising the dots in the wake of the substantial  unfunded fiscal easing    His reply  we suspect  will be something like   It s not our job to tell Congress how to conduct fiscal policy  and it s too soon to assess the impact of the tax cuts and spending increases  Much of the easing of policy could be saved rather than spent  and there are encouraging signs that productivity is picking up  so any upturn in wage growth as a result of fiscal loosening need not necessarily generate higher inflation  In any event  with inflation well below target  gradual normalization is the best way to balance the risks of both future inflation and the premature ending of the cycle via excessive tightening  Stephen Stanley  Amherst Pierpont   The bulk of the interest in this week s F O M C  meeting will come from the updated dot and economic projections as well as any meaningful tweaks to the key elements of the F O M C  statement  Any changes to the dots and statement language are likely to be in the hawkish direction  though I would expect that the new information will be more evolutionary than a radically different  Steve Rick  CUNA Mutual Group  There is  a very strong case for not only raising rates this week  but potentially doing so in a more aggressive manner than previously forecasted at the end of 2017  I think we could see projections get updated to call for four hikes instead of three  with plans for lifting rates more in coming years as well  Chris Zaccarelli  Independent Advisor Alliance   Whether we have 3 or 4 rate hikes this year shouldn t be that big of a difference to the economy  but it WILL have a big impact on market prices and market psychology  Every statement   whether spoken or written   will be highly scrutinized looking for clues as to whether the Fed Funds rate will be 1  higher  or only 75 bps  a year from now  President Trump s plan to hit countries around the world with stiff tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum has dominated a gathering of world economic leaders amid fears that the United States is on the cusp of starting an international trade war On Monday  Steven Mnuchin  the United States Treasury secretary  was peppered with requests from several countries for exemptions from the tariffs  which are being imposed in the name of national security In an interview on the sidelines of the meeting  Mr  Mnuchin suggested exemptions to the tariffs could be announced  relatively quickly  Mr  Mnuchin said Mr  Trump has already said he would exempt Canada and Mexico from the tariffs upon a successful renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement  and he has indicated that other countries could also get exemptions  But the United States has yet to detail exactly what would qualify a country for an exemption  other than a vague reference to protecting the United States  national security and reducing bilateral trade deficits Countries including France  Argentina and South Korea pressed Mr  Mnuchin on Monday about being freed from the metals tariffs  arguing that  as United States allies  they should not be penalized on national security grounds  Mr  Mnuchin said that decisions were being made on a case by case basis and that there was not a one size fits all approach to deciding which countries would be exempt  The tariffs go into effect on Friday   Alan RappeportThe Federal Trade Commission has opened an investigation into

"WASHINGTON   For 10 days  Mark Zuckerberg  Facebook s chief executive  has been under increasing pressure from lawmakers and regulators to answer questions about the improper harvesting of data of 50 million Facebook users by a British political consulting firm  Cambridge Analytica Now Mr  Zuckerberg plans to go to Washington to explain himself The chief executive has agreed to testify in at least one congressional hearing over the social network s handling of customer data  according to people familiar with the decision  Specifically  he plans to appear next month before the House Energy and Commerce Committee  said the people  who asked not to be identified because the arrangements were not public  Mr  Zuckerberg may make other appearances  he has also been asked to testify before the Senate and House Judiciary and Commerce Committees His appearing on Capitol Hill could create a spectacle that is replayed online and on television for years to come  especially amid a backlash against the power of tech behemoths  Late last year  executives from Facebook  Google and Twitter showed up at congressional hearings to discuss Russian meddling online in the 2016 presidential election  putting faces to the tech platforms during criticism of their misuse Congressional testimony by Silicon Valley chief executives is rare  and their appearances have each set off a media circus  In 2013  Apple s chief executive  Timothy D  Cook  addressed senators about his company s tax practices  In 2011  Google s chairman at the time  Eric Schmidt  spoke about the company s search practices in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee  And in 1998  Bill Gates  who was Microsoft s chief executive  defended his company against lawmakers  assertions that he was building a monopoly   an argument he eventually lost in court  The committee is continuing to work with Facebook to determine a day and time for Mr  Zuckerberg to testify   said Elena Hernandez  a spokeswoman for the House Energy and Commerce Committee CNN earlier reported that Mr  Zuckerberg had decided to testify in front of Congress He has been under pressure to appear before Congress since reports on March 17 that Cambridge Analytica improperly obtained and used the data of 50 million Facebook users  The revelations immediately sparked a furor on both sides of the Atlantic  with regulators in Britain and the United States calling for Mr  Zuckerberg to discuss what happened Those calls haven t subsided  even though the chief executive issued a public statement last week outlining the steps that Facebook was taking to prevent improper  harvesting of the data of its 2 2  billion users  On Monday  the Federal Trade Commission confirmed that it was investigating how Facebook handles information about its users  Politicians including Senator Charles E  Grassley  Republican of Iowa  have also pressed for Mr  Zuckerberg to appear on Capitol Hill Mr  Zuckerberg has turned down some requests to go before lawmakers  He declined to appear this week before the British Parliament and answer questions about data privacy Facebook staff have held marathon meetings and phone calls with staff from congressional committees over the past week  according to Facebook employees and others briefed on the matter  Rob Sherman  Facebook s deputy chief privacy officer  and Molly Cutler  its associate general counsel  have met with staff from the House and Senate Commerce  Judiciary and Intelligence Committees  they said Mr  Zuckerberg initially resisted speaking to Congress  and had asked if a senior Facebook executive could be sent to represent the company in his name  two Facebook employees familiar with the conversations said After the public outcry over Facebook s data and privacy settings  Mr  Zuckerberg was persuaded that he needed to appear  they said  In recent days  he told Facebook employees that he had come to understand he would have to testify In an interview with CNN last week  Mr  Zuckerberg said that he would be  happy to  testify in front of Congress and that  it s the right thing to do   He added of Cambridge Analytica   This was a major breach of trust  and I m really sorry that this happened  Google and Twitter have also been called to testify before Congress on data privacy  The companies didn t respond to requests for comment Lawmakers have been frustrated in the past by Mr  Zuckerberg s absence from hearings  Last year  Facebook sent its general counsel  Colin Stretch  to join lawyers from Twitter and Google to testify about social media s role in spreading disinformation during the 2016 election  Lawmakers noted the absence of senior executives  including Mr  Zuckerberg  and repeatedly challenged Facebook to send its leaders to answer questions In a recent interview  Senator John Kennedy  Republican of Louisiana  said Mr  Zuckerberg needed to directly answer questions from Congress about what kind of user data was being gathered and shared  because Facebook has been too vague about its practices  He said the attorneys for Facebook  Google and Twitter who testified about the 2016 election had  dodged questions   They didn t say a damn thing  which was what they were paid to do   Mr  Kennedy said   I d encourage Mr  Zuckerberg to do the common sense thing and roll up his sleeves and take a meaningful amount of time talking to us about this  "
"WASHINGTON   Federal regulators and state prosecutors are opening investigations into Facebook  Politicians in the United States and Europe are calling for its chief executive  Mark Zuckerberg  to testify before them  Investors have cut the value of the social networking giant by about  50 billion in the past two days They are all focused on the same thing  whether Facebook mishandled users  data Facebook has built its highly profitable social network off its users  selling advertisements based on their ages  interests and other details  But the scrutiny over the company s vast trove of personal data   following a report that a political consulting firm had improperly obtained information of 50 million users   is taking direct aim at that lucrative formula  Investors are reacting to fears of regulation and the consequences of regulation   said Brian Wieser  a senior research analyst at Pivotal Research Group   The scale of errors can only lead one to conclude these are systemic problems  So far  most of the social network s top executives have been silent  Mr  Zuckerberg  its founder  and Sheryl Sandberg  his top deputy  have not made any public statements in recent days  The pair did not appear at an employee meeting on Tuesday in Menlo Park  Calif   where the company is based At the meeting  employees asked questions about the continuing internal investigation into the use of Facebook data by the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica  The firm  which was tied to President Trump s 2016 campaign  used the data to target messages to voters The meeting  which included Facebook s deputy counsel  Paul Grewal  largely focused on the steps that Facebook was taking to ensure its data could no longer be misused by independent researchers  according to Facebook employees in attendance  Mr  Zuckerberg was expected to address employees on Friday  when the company holds an all hands meeting The company has faced internal dissent over its broader role in spreading disinformation during the presidential campaign and its response to it  The tensions have prompted the planned departure of Alex Stamos  Facebook s chief security officer  who plans to leave in August The pressure on Facebook has been building for years It started in the European Union  where regulators have taken an aggressive attitude toward Facebook and other American technology giants for their sway over the region s 500 million people  The company has been the subject of several privacy investigations and charges by European regulators  Europe has approved a new privacy law  which takes effect in May  that will give users of Facebook  Google and other internet services more control over how their data is collected and what Silicon Valley companies know about them After the 2016 presidential campaign  lawmakers at home joined the chorus of critics  citing the company s role in Russia s disinformation efforts  The social network was one of the top tools used by Russians to spread false news  and the company s executives have struggled to explain what happened and how they would prevent foreign interference in the future The Cambridge Analytica revelations have forced Facebook to scramble to assuage fresh concerns by regulators and lawmakers  The company is sending its representatives to Capitol Hill and arranging conversations with state attorneys general to try to answer questions about how the firm collected the information of Facebook users The social networking giant is also facing an investigation by the Federal Trade Commission  which is looking into whether Facebook violated an agreement with the agency  according to a person with knowledge of the inquiry The F T C  investigation is connected to a settlement the agency reached with Facebook in 2011 after finding that the company had told users that third party apps on the social media site  like games  would not be allowed to access their data  But the apps  the agency found  were able to obtain almost all personal information about a user The current investigation has parallels  The information on the 50 million users was harvested in 2014 by an outside researcher  Aleksandr Kogan  Mr  Kogan  a professor at Cambridge University  paid users small sums to take a personality quiz and download an app  which collected private information from their profiles and from those of their friends  Facebook allowed that sort of data collection at the time Then  Mr  Kogan gave the information to Cambridge Analytica  a firm founded by Stephen K  Bannon  the former White House political adviser  and Robert Mercer  the wealthy Republican donor  Passing the information to a third party violated Facebook s policies  the company said last week  There are all sorts of obligations under the consent decree that may not have been honored here   said David Vladeck  a former director of consumer protection at the F T C The company could face fines of  40 000 a day per violation if the agency finds that Facebook broke the agreement  We are aware of the issues that have been raised but cannot comment on whether we are investigating   an F T C  spokeswoman said in a statement on Tuesday   We take any allegations of violations of our consent decrees very seriously  Facebook said it expected to receive questions from the F T C  related to potential violations of the 2011 consent decree   We remain strongly committed to protecting people s information   Facebook s deputy chief privacy officer  Rob Sherman  said in a statement   We appreciate the opportunity to answer questions the F T C  may have  The F T C  inquiry is just one piece of the regulatory backlash  On Tuesday  the New York attorney general  Eric T  Schneiderman  announced that he was joining the Massachusetts attorney general  Maura Healey  in an investigation into whether Facebook had failed to protect the privacy of users in those states  New Jersey s attorney general announced a similar investigation Mr  Schneiderman and Ms  Healey sent a letter to Facebook on Tuesday that demanded records of the communications between the company and Cambridge Analytica  Consumers have a right to know how their information is used   and companies like Facebook have a fundamental responsibility to protect their users  personal information   Mr  Schneiderman said   Today s demand letter is the first step in our joint investigation to get to the bottom of what happened  There have also been growing calls for the top leadership at Facebook to appear before American and British lawmakers to testify about the company and Cambridge Analytica Senators Amy Klobuchar  Democrat of Minnesota  and John Kennedy  Republican of Louisiana  have asked the chairman of the Judiciary Committee  Charles E  Grassley  Republican of Iowa  to hold a hearing  Republican leaders of the Senate Commerce Committee  organized by John Thune of South Dakota  wrote a letter on Monday to Mr  Zuckerberg demanding answers to questions about how the data had been collected and if users were able to control the misuse of data by third parties  It s time for Mr  Zuckerberg and the other C E O s to testify before Congress   Senator Mark Warner  Democrat of Virginia  said on Tuesday   The American people deserve answers about social media manipulation in the 2016 election  Facebook staff members were scheduled to brief the office of Mr  Warner  the top Democrat on the Intelligence committee  and the offices of members of other committees  including Commerce  this week  The possibility that Facebook has either not been transparent with consumers or has not been able to verify that third party app developers are transparent with consumers is troubling   Mr  Thune said in his letter On Tuesday morning  a committee within the British Parliament sent a letter to Mr  Zuckerberg that asked him to appear before the panel to answer questions on the company s connection to Cambridge Analytica  The president of the European Parliament also requested an appearance by Mr  Zuckerberg  The committee has repeatedly asked Facebook about how companies acquire and hold on to user data from their site  and in particular about whether data had been taken without their consent   wrote Damian Collins  chairman of the British committee   Your officials  answers have consistently understated this risk  and have been misleading to the committee  "
"In the wake of news that the Facebook data of 50 million people was obtained by Cambridge Analytica  a political data firm  many users are mulling whether it is time to leave the social network  Even a co founder of WhatsApp  which Facebook bought for  16 billion in 2014  declared that it was time to delete Facebook But while deleting your account is as simple as clicking on a few buttons  Facebook may be too ubiquitous to truly quit  For one  it would probably be inaccurate to say you have removed Facebook from your life just by leaving the site  Chances are you still use WhatsApp  the largest messaging app in the world  or Instagram  the most popular photo sharing app  Facebook owns both Keep in mind that Facebook isn t the only company capable of collecting your information  One big culprit  Web trackers  like cookies embedded into websites and their ads  They are everywhere  and they follow your activities from site to site You can quit Facebook if you simply find no joy in it  But if you re looking to leave for philosophical reasons concerning privacy  it s a futile effort  You may be better off tweaking your privacy settings on the site Here are some answers to questions that many people are posing to The New York Times via social media What are the alternatives to using Facebook  Instagram and WhatsApp There is no real substitute for Facebook if you re looking for a social network that includes virtually everyone you meet in real life  Social networks are all about the people on them  and Facebook has more than 2 billion monthly users  You could consider Snapchat  which has about 187 million daily users  but it s a far different experience   you primarily use it to send photos that self destruct   with an interface that many people find confusing There are plenty of alternatives to WhatsApp  But they have drawbacks and aren t as far reaching as WhatsApp  which has more than 1 5 billion monthly users Signal is a solid app for secure encrypted messaging   but it is still a young service with a relatively small number of users  You might be able to get hundreds of your friends to join Signal  But chances are you have friends or family in other countries  and WhatsApp is the go to messaging service internationally  For example  practically every smartphone user in India   more than 200 million people   uses WhatsApp Another WhatsApp alternative is WeChat  a Chinese messaging app that has about a billion monthly users  But the majority of people on that service are in China  And WeChat faces its own privacy issues because of China s notorious reputation for mass surveillance  Tencent  the company that runs WeChat  denies that it stores the chat histories of its users  But WeChat users have been arrested over conversations they have had in the app  and chat transcripts have been used as evidence in court proceedings Instagram  which has more than 800 million monthly users  is also a tough one  giving Facebook a stranglehold on photo sharing  The only real competitor to Instagram is Facebook itself  which has its own photo sharing features  Remember Flickr  The Yahoo owned site is the closest thing either has to a competitor  and it s like a graveyard of people s digital memories before they abandoned it for Facebook and Instagram Google Photos is a compelling service  but it is a photo album management tool  not so much a social network How else do you keep in touch with friends and family  How do you create and discover events  How do you market and manage customer service for your small business  How do you spark and build grass roots movements Facebook is the one stop shop to accomplish all those tasks  But if you have the patience  you can juggle multiple apps to cobble together the same experience Messaging apps are popular for keeping in touch with friends and family   a group chat between family members via text message  for example  is still an efficient way to keep in touch  And sites like MeetUp are designed for hosting and discovering events As for customer service  many companies use Twitter to engage with their customers and resolve complaints  Yelp  the reviews site for local businesses  is a common place for customers to talk about their experiences  and business owners often engage with people there For grass roots movements  a Twitter hashtag might be enough  Recent examples include  metoo  the movement for people to discuss sexual assault   deleteuber  the campaign to protest Uber last year amid political controversy  and now  there is the movement to  deletefacebook in response to the Cambridge Analytica controversy What does it mean to delete Facebook  How can you actually delete your account You can permanently delete your account by clicking a few buttons on Facebook s website  The company delays deletion for a few days  so do not log back in  Facebook also offers a tool for extracting a copy of your data before deleting your account After you delete your account  it won t be recoverable  But there are caveats Shadows of your digital self would remain on the site  For example  if people uploaded photos of you  those photos will still be there  The conversations you had with friends through Facebook won t disappear  either When you delete your account  you are only deleting the media you posted  like your status updates and photos that you uploaded  That s not going to do much for your privacy  considering that an overwhelming amount of what you do on Facebook involves engaging with other people  All of your friends  and their friends  too  would also have to delete their accounts in order to have any sort of meaningful effect What other things are you losing access to if you delete Facebook  Why do so many apps require a Facebook login One painful part of breaking up with Facebook would be potentially losing access to the many third party apps and websites that are tied to your account  Over the past decade  many shopping sites and apps teamed up with Facebook to use the company s login tool  Facebook Login Facebook Login became popular because it was a good product  By clicking a button  you could sign up for an account with an app or website just by sharing your Facebook account data  That allowed you to skip manually entering details like your name and email address   a process that is especially cumbersome on a small smartphone screen  This sped up the process of signing up for an account to buy that pair of shoes you saw go on sale If you were to delete Facebook  you would break your access to many sites and apps that you signed up for using Facebook Login  But fortunately  many sites and apps still let you sign up for accounts directly through them  and many also let you log in through your Google account It s not impossible to delete Facebook  But it would be a long and tedious process to create new accounts for all the apps and sites you use Where does Facebook really equal the internet Keep in mind that Facebook reaches well beyond the United States  As my colleague Sheera Frenkel noted on Twitter  deleting Facebook is a privilege  In some parts of the world  like Myanmar  Egypt and Indonesia  people rely on Facebook as a primary means to conduct business and stay in touch with friends and family  In Africa  Facebook has struck deals that offer basic services   centered on those provided by Facebook   to residents for free "
"LONDON    The computer expert who alleges a trove of Facebook data was improperly used to help Donald Trump s White House bid said Tuesday that he strongly believes the information was also used by the Brexit movement that persuaded Britain to quit the European Union In a 3  hour hearing  Chris Wylie told the House of Commons media committee that he believes the breach exceeded the 50 million Facebook users reported earlier   though he didn t give an exact figure  And he said the data compiled by the political consulting business Cambridge Analytica was available to other firms with links to it  All kinds of people had access to the data   said Wylie  who helped develop Cambridge Analytica s methods for using the information to target and persuade voters   It was everywhere  Among the companies that had access to the data was AggregateIQ  a Canadian political consultant that did work for Vote Leave  the official campaign backing Britain s withdrawal from the EU  Wylie said Wylie described Cambridge Analytica as just one arm of a global company  SCL Group  that gets most of its income from military contracts but is also a political gun for hire  often in countries where democratic institutions are weak  He suggested the company combines computer algorithms and dirty tricks to help candidates win regardless of the cost The 28 year old Canadian with a swath of pink hair says he helped set up Cambridge Analytica in 2013  He left the next year Wylie has previously alleged that Cambridge Analytica used personal data improperly collected from Facebook users to help Trump s 2016 presidential campaign Cambridge Analytica says none of the Facebook data was used in its work on the Trump campaign  It denies any wrongdoing Cambridge Analytica s acting CEO  Alexander Tayler  said in a statement that Wylie was a part time contractor who  has no direct knowledge of our work or practices  since he left the company Wylie said he  absolutely  believes AggregateIQ drew on Cambridge Analytica s databases for its work on the Brexit campaign  In the closely fought referendum in 2016  51 9 percent of voters backed Britain s departure from the EU  I think it is incredibly reasonable to say that AIQ played a very significant role in Leave winning   Wylie said He testified that AggregateIQ was formed when Cambridge Analytica sought to expand but Canadians he wanted to bring into the business didn t want to relocate to Britain  The two firms shared underlying technology and worked so closely together that Cambridge Analytica staff often referred to the Canadian firm as a  department   he said Because of the links between the two companies  Vote Leave got the  the next best thing  to Cambridge Analytica when it hired AggregateIQ   a company that can do virtually everything that  Cambridge Analytica  can do but with a different billing name   Wylie said AggregateIQ  based in Victoria  British Columbia  issued a statement saying it has never been part of Cambridge Analytica or SCL  AggregateIQ works in full compliance within all legal and regulatory requirements in all jurisdictions where it operates   the company said   All work AggregateIQ does for each client is kept separate from every other client  Wylie s testimony came a day after Wylie and two other former insiders presented 50 pages of documents that they said proved Vote Leave violated election finance rules during the referendum campaign They allege that Vote Leave circumvented spending limits by donating 625 000 pounds   888 000  to the pro Brexit student group BeLeave  which then sent the money directly to AggregateIQ Vote Leave denies breaking any campaign finance regulations  Dominic Cummings  the Vote Leave strategist  called Wylie a  fantasist charlatan  "

"Facebook said it would roll out a centralized system for its users to control their privacy and security settings in response to an outcry over the way it has handled personal data The system  which will be introduced to Facebook users globally over the coming weeks  will allow people to change their privacy and security settings from one place rather than having to go to roughly 20 separate sections across the social media platform From the new page  users can control the personal information the social network keeps on them  such as their political preferences or interests  and download and review a file of data Facebook has collected about them  Facebook also will clarify what types of apps people are currently using and what permissions those apps have to gather their information Facebook began developing the centralized system last year but sped it up after revelations that a British political consulting firm  Cambridge Analytica  improperly harvested the information of 50 million users of the social network  The amount of data Cambridge Analytica obtained about Facebook users reawakened fears over how much information the social network has gathered about people  leading to a  DeleteFacebook movement and other criticism  The last week showed how much more work we need to do to enforce our policies  and to help people understand how Facebook works and the choices they have over their data   Erin Egan  Facebook s chief privacy officer  and Ashlie Beringer  a Facebook deputy general counsel  said in a statement announcing the new system   We ve heard loud and clear that privacy settings and other important tools are too hard to find  and that we must do more to keep people informed  The Cambridge Analytica scandal has plunged Facebook into its worst crisis in years  with regulators and lawmakers in the United States and Britain demanding answers about how the social network deals with data privacy  Mark Zuckerberg  Facebook s chief executive  has agreed to appear in front of lawmakers on Capitol Hill next month  people familiar with the decision have said Last week  Mr  Zuckerberg said in a statement that Facebook had to do better with user data and promised to roll out products that give users more control over their information and privacy settings  One of our biggest responsibilities is to protect data   he told The New York Times last week   Whenever there s an issue where someone s data gets passed to someone who the rules of the system shouldn t have allowed it to  that s rightfully a big issue and deserves to be a big uproar Late Wednesday  Facebook also said that it was halting its practice of allowing advertisers to target ads using information from third party data brokers  These are business to business companies that can collect a vast range of details about individual consumers such as their shopping habits  health concerns  income range and preferred credit card The social network had previously allowed advertisers to use consumer details from data brokers like Experian  Acxiom and Oracle s Datalogix unit to help target ads to Facebook users  But Facebook said it was now mothballing that option  called  Partner Categories   We want to let advertisers know that we will be shutting down Partner Categories   Graham Mudd  a product marketing director at Facebook  said in a statement  This product enables third party data providers to offer their targeting directly on Facebook   he added   While this is common industry practice  we believe this step  winding down over the next six months  will help improve people s privacy on Facebook  In 2012  the Federal Trade Commission opened an inquiry into data brokers and subsequently recommended that Congress consider enacting a law  to make data broker practices more visible to consumers and to give consumers greater control over the immense amounts of personal information about them collected and shared by data brokers  How much of a difference these actions may make to Facebook s data privacy practices was unclear  Some privacy advocates noted  for instance  that the company s new centralized privacy and security settings page has been tried in the past  The platform made similar promises many times before   said Zeynep Tufekci  an associate professor at the University of North Carolina who studies how technology affects society  She pointed out that in 2010  Mr  Zuckerberg said in The Washington Post that Facebook users needed simpler controls over their privacy and had promised then that Facebook would  add privacy controls that are much simpler to use  Yet eight years later  the same concerns have resurfaced  Ms  Tufekci said  The past decade shows that user concerns over privacy appear to have little teeth on changing how the platform behaves  aside from a recycling of contrite statements and promises to do better from its C E O    she said "

"Good morning  Want to get California Today by email  Here s the sign up  Facebook has had a particularly bad few days  even for a Silicon Valley giant that has been under fire for months  The social network  which was once Silicon Valley s pride and joy  is now facing a new scandal over data privacy   and the fallout has been intense and keeps widening Let s recap how it all unfolded Over the weekend  The New York Times  along with The Observer of London and The Guardian  broke the news that a British political consulting firm  Cambridge Analytica  improperly obtained data on 50 million Facebook users and used it to target messages to potential American voters The revelations set off an immediate hue and cry  American and British lawmakers demanded that Facebook explain how the data had been harvested without people being alerted  Senator Amy Klobuchar  a Democrat from Minnesota  pressed Mark Zuckerberg  Facebook s chief executive  to appear before lawmakers in person  Others have since piled on On Monday  The Times reported that Facebook s executive in charge of information security  Alex Stamos  was planning to leave the social network by August  The move reflected heightened internal tensions at the top of the company  showing how the scrutiny has taken a toll Criticism of Facebook intensified on Tuesday  Wall Street investors sold off the company s shares  with a nearly 7 percent drop on Monday and a 2 5 percent fall on Tuesday  To top it off  the Federal Trade Commission opened an investigation into whether Facebook violated an agreement on data

Times The rain storms hitting California this week have been called many things  but two related terms keep popping up to describe this weather system   atmospheric river  and  Pineapple Express  So which one is it  Pineapple Express was a term for many years used to identify storms that came from Hawaii and hit the West Coast   said Marty Ralph  a research meteorologist affiliated with U C  San Diego s Scripps Institution of Oceanography   About 15 years ago we recognized that there s a broader definition called an atmospheric river  and those happen all over the planet  For non scientists  atmospheric rivers can be conceptualized visually  If you look from space from a satellite  it does look like a sinuous river   said Daniel Swain  a climate scientist at U C L A   It s a colorful term  and it s actually the official meteorological term to describe this process  But while all Pineapple Express storms are atmospheric rivers  not all atmospheric rivers are classified as Pineapple Express storms The source for the particular atmospheric river hitting California this week is near the Hawaiian Islands  hence the playful  Pineapple Express   Not everyone agrees  though  that this storm falls under that category  I wouldn t call this one a Pineapple Express  The storm is coming from the West  but the tail of this atmospheric river didn t come from Hawaii  it came from east of Hawaii   Mr  Ralph said   But I m not sure about arguing the jargon too much on this  The modern term is atmospheric river  Nomenclature aside  Mr  Swain urged residents in burn areas not to ignore the orders because of storm fatigue  Though the storm may not hit Los Angeles too hard  it could wallop those in Santa Barbara County  The forecast is severe  and if water falls too quickly it could lead to substantial flooding and mudslides  The forecast is for a really  really big rain   he said   Maybe half a foot or more of water is going to fall in a lot of places that have had intense fire activity  Whether all those inches of rain fall over three days or in a six hours is hard to predict  California Today goes live at 6 a m  Pacific time weekdays  Tell us what you want to see  CAtoday

"WASHINGTON   House Intelligence Committee Republicans said Thursday that opposition to Donald J  Trump by the party s national security establishment had opened the door for two foreign policy advisers whose interactions with Russian intelligence prompted F B I  scrutiny The Republicans said they had found no evidence that either man  George Papadopoulos and Carter Page  had colluded with the Russians  despite the F B I  s interest in the men  Nor did campaign advisers and aides provide evidence that any member of the Trump campaign had colluded either  according to summaries of 44 findings and more than two dozen recommendations the committee voted to release Thursday  When asked directly  none of the interviewed witnesses provided evidence of collusion  coordination or conspiracy between the Trump campaign and the Russian government   one of the findings read First previewed last week  the findings are the culmination of a year old investigation by the committee  Democrats say the Republicans hurried the investigation  ignored crucial evidence and failed to follow obvious leads in an effort to clear Mr  Trump Other findings were less controversial and reflected the consensus position of American intelligence agencies and both parties on Capitol Hill  Representative K  Michael Conaway  Republican of Texas  who led the inquiry  said that the committee had found  a pattern of Russian active measures in the United States  both through cyberattacks and their use of social media to sow discord   This poses a serious threat to future U S  elections  including the primary elections that are already underway   he said in a statement   It s critical to release this information now to protect our country and our elections from foreign interference  In addition to releasing the summary findings  the committee voted to release a Republican written 250 page report over the objections of the committee s Democrats  who offered a series of unsuccessful last ditch motions to subpoena witnesses and documents  as well as to urge the House to hold Stephen K  Bannon  Mr  Trump s former adviser  in contempt  It was a fundamentally unserious effort   said Representative Adam B  Schiff of California  the top Democrat on the panel Democrats are drafting a dissenting report based on the committee s work thus far and have pledged to push on with their investigation without Republican cooperation  They have secured the cooperation of at least one new witness  Christopher Wylie  who helped found Cambridge Analytica and develop the company s voter profiling technology The Republican report chronicles Russia s increasingly brazen efforts in the run up to the 2016 election to compromise the United States  political institutions and fan existing divisions among voters  It concludes that the response by the Obama administration had been  insufficient  and said an October 2016 public statement calling out Russia proved  ineffective  The report takes issue with the  analytical tradecraft  used by intelligence agencies that concluded that President Vladimir V  Putin of Russia had wanted to harm the candidacy of Hillary Clinton and help Mr  Trump More divisive are the findings on collusion  That subject remains an area of inquiry by the Senate Intelligence Committee and the special counsel  Robert S  Mueller III  who took over the F B I  s investigation of the Trump campaign last year The House Republicans said that they had found repeated contacts between members of the Trump campaign team and Russians  but in each case  they concluded that there was no evidence of improper collaboration  Mr  Papadopoulos s attempts to connect the Trump campaign with the Russians had been  unsuccessful  Contacts with WikiLeaks were  ill advised   but did not show evidence that Trump associates were involved in the hacking or publication of Democratic emails  Republicans said  And though the Republicans said they were  concerned  about Mr  Page s  seemingly incomplete accounts  of a summer 2016 trip to Moscow  they noted that he had not been traveling on behalf of the campaign  Possible Russian efforts to set up a  back channel  with Trump associates after the election suggest the absence of collusion during the campaign  since the communication associated with collusion would have rendered such a  back channel  unnecessary   the Republicans wrote in another finding Many of the committee s recommendations center on the securing of the United States  voting systems and echo those presented by the Senate Intelligence Committee in recent days  including steps to improve communications of threats between states and the federal government and to ensure voting systems are not hacked Others could prove more controversial  For instance  the Republicans recommend that Congress consider repealing the Logan Act  a 1799 statute that bars private citizens from interfering with American diplomatic relations  The statute has never been successfully used in court but has been discussed in connection with contacts between Michael T  Flynn  Mr  Trump s first national security adviser  and the Russian ambassador at the time during the presidential transition They also recommend that the executive branch consider mandatory polygraph tests for political appointees with top secret security clearances who are not confirmed by the Senate "
" Good Friday  Here s what we re watching   Dropbox s valuation gives investors reason for caution   Dropbox rises 45 percent in its first day of trading   President Trump signs spending bill   GlaxoSmithKline withdrew its bid for Pfizer s consumer division   Bank of America Merrill Lynch paid  42 million to settle with N Y  s attorney general over trading practices   How bad will the U S  China trade fight be Get this in your inbox each morning  Sign up here Dropbox faces fierce competition  doesn t make a profit  its user growth has slowed  and outside shareholders have negligible voting power Yet for now  at least  investors think the company has an amazing future This optimism is reflected in the price of Dropbox s shares after they traded publicly for the first time on Friday  They leaped to  29 per share from  21  giving Dropbox  which charges businesses and individuals to store files on its computers  a market value of  12 7 billion  Putting that number in context reveals the bullishness of investors  Dropbox didn t have any profits in recent years  so comparisons have to be done using revenue and cash flows At  29  Dropbox is trading at 11 5 times last year s revenue of  1 1 billion  That is far higher than the 2 6 times sales for the companies in the Nasdaq index  according to Bloomberg data Of course  Dropbox s shares have benefited from demand for initial public offerings by technology companies  The stock might give back the gains  just as Snap s did after its I P O  last year Still  Dropbox s fans believe that the company has a strong financial future  despite competition from the likes of Google and Amazon  One of their main arguments is that the company can increase its revenue faster than its costs  a dynamic that should expand profit margins over time  Rishi N  Jaluria  an analyst at D A  Davidson  zeros in on its free cash flows  the amount of cash generated by a business after subtracting spending on plants and certain lease payments  to show this His measure of free cash flows was equivalent to 16 percent of revenue last year  but  in his estimation  that margin could rise to 19 percent this year  then 22 percent in 2019 After Friday s huge pop  Dropbox s stock has arguably  priced in  the impressive future cash flows that some analysts expect  Indeed  using Mr  Jaluria s forecasts  Dropbox s shares are already trading at a far higher cash flow valuation than that of Salesforce  a software and cloud computing company with a long track record What is more  Dropbox has areas of concern that should  in theory  give investors pause  The number of paid users grew 25 percent last year  slower than the 35 percent rate in 2016  Its average revenue per paying user edged up just 1 percent last year  Facebook s shares trade at the same multiple to sales as Dropbox s  Yet its revenue per user surged 26 percent last year   Peter EavisDropbox finished at  28 48  up 36 percent from its initial public offering price The file storage company on Thursday sold 36 million shares at  21 apiece  That was above its expected range of  18 to  20 a share and valued the company  9 2 billion At Friday s close  Dropbox is valued at  12 5 billionHere are some more numbers to put the I P O  market into perspective   So far this year  38 companies have listed shares on American exchanges  raising  12 8 billion  That s up 13 percent from a year ago and the most year to date since 2011  according to Thomson Reuters   The shares of companies that have debuted on American exchanges this year are up  on average

Solid Biosciences LLC   48 percent The closer investors look at President Trump s tariffs against China  the less they seem to like them This can be seen in the way the stock market has responded to the trade restrictions  which were announced on Thursday but were flagged a few days earlier  The S  P  500 index was down 5 95 percent this week  falling every day but one  And the selling at the end of the week looked like like it was turning into a rout  with the S  P  500 skidding 2 52 percent on Thursday and 2 1 percent on Friday We know that Mr  Trump watches the stock market s response to his policies  He was reassured when the stock market rose after he announced tariffs on imported steel and aluminum  Will this week s nosedive unsettle him to the point he softens his stance on trade with China  Mr  Trump sounded unfazed on Friday   I think the stock market is going to be great   he said   Peter EavisThe president abruptly backed down from his threat to veto the  1 3 trillion spending bill and signed it into law on Friday  avoiding a government shutdown Early in the day  the president had tweeted his displeasure with the bill  citing Congress s failure to fund his long promised border wall From this morning Julie Hirschfeld and Michael D  Shear of the NYT  The backstory to the bill  Here s how Congressional leaders settled lawmakers  objections  As Facebook plunged into a crisis over how Cambridge Analytica  a political consulting firm that provided voter targeting services to the Trump campaign  improperly obtained data on 50 million Facebook users  Mark Zuckerberg came under criticism for saying nothing  Finally  on Wednesday he released a statement and sat down for interviews  We asked Paul Pendergrass  a long time corporate communication professional and formerly DealBook s  Jack Flack  columnist  to offer his insights into the situation  In most of the interviews on Wednesday  Mark Zuckerberg was asked if he would be willing to testify before Congress  a task he has previously delegated to other senior Facebook executives  I d be happy to   he told CNN s Laurie Segall  before immediately qualifying that answer with   if it s the right thing to do  He then went on to offer Facebook s standard response to questions about why it has previously chosen other executives for Congressional hearings He elaborated Mr  Zuckerberg was surely being coy  When Congress requests the presence of a C E O  embroiled in a high profile controversy  they re usually not looking for information  They want a pelt to hang on the wall  and celebrity chief executives are particularly attractive So it s definitely a media opportunity  but for members of Congress  not the C E O If Mr  Zuckerberg wants proof of that  he can ask John Stumpf  the former C E O  of Wells Fargo  and the bank s current chief executive  Tim Sloan  how much information they were asked to provide  He could ask the same of the C E O  of United Airlines  Oscar Munoz  about his trip to Capitol Hill just after a passenger was dragged off one of his airplanes  For that matter  Mr  Zuckerberg could walk down the hallway and ask Facebook s general counsel  Colin Stretch  Just last fall Mr  Stretch endured a Senate lashing over the use of Facebook by Russian operatives When Mr  Zuckerberg is brought in to testify  the committee s  goal  will be to ensure the American public understands why social media platforms can t be trusted to regulate themselves  Mr  Zuckerberg s goal will be to try to avoid acting in a way that would elevate his role as the designated villain in the story Mr  Zuckerberg seems resigned to the fact that he will likely end up testifying   I would imagine at some time there will be a topic where I will be the sole authority on  and it will make sense for me to do it   he told Ms  Segall After this past week  he will have little leeway to refuse  Having been roundly accused of hiding in the crucial early days of the Cambridge Analytica scandal  he won t want to provide further evidence that he is inaccessible when people need to see him most Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg have clashed on artificial intelligence  space travel and the direction of technology On Friday  Mr  Musk showed just how little love lost there was between the two tech titans Mr  Musk  the chief executive of SpaceX and Tesla  deleted the Facebook pages of both of his companies  the NYT s Nellie Bowles reports Mr  Musk growing chorus of tech leaders calling for people to abandon Mr  Zuckerberg s social network after it allowed a political consulting firm  Cambridge Analytica  to obtain and misuse data on 50 million users China s state backed funds have a history of stepping in to smooth out swings in the country s stock market  And so on Friday as China stocks tumbled amid fears of a trade war with the United States  those funds began buying  Bloomberg reports  citing unnamed sources They purchased large cap stocks

American regulators and the Trump administration  That included appearing in a televised speech at the White House with Mr  Trump last November  during which Mr  Tan promised to redomicile Broadcom in the United States They re here  President Trump imposed  60 billion worth of tariffs and penalties on Chinese goods  China is threatening tariffs on  3 billion worth of U S  goods like nuts  wine and

conditions could bolster the long term prospects of U S  firms  And if the U S  is able to recruit other countries to its cause  China may relent  Still  much could go wrong On the other tariffs  The

"As questions mounted last year about whether Facebook had been exploited to tilt the U S  presidential election  Mark Zuckerberg landed on a fishing trawler off Alabama s Gulf coast But the chatter surrounding the CEO s arrival in port was that it signaled something bigger than just the start of a 30 state personal tour  his designs on a job even more powerful than leading the social network that links 2 2 billion people worldwide  I asked him if he was interested in running for president of the United States   said Dominick Ficarino  who owns a shrimp business in Bayou La Batre  Alabama  and hosted Zuckerberg that afternoon   And his answer to me was   Can I answer you with a question  If you were me  would you   Thirteen months later  Zuckerberg no longer has the luxury of mulling a hypothetical next act  Instead  he is grappling with a crisis that has enveloped the company synonymous with his face and name  It does not help that the most glaring reminder of Facebook s flaws is the unabated uproar over the American presidency itself  The world feels anxious and divided  and Facebook has a lot of work to do   Zuckerberg wrote in January  laying out his annual  personal challenge  In 2017  the billionaire sought to travel to every state he d never visited  This year  Zuckerberg said his personal goal is to  fix  Facebook Yet things continue to get worse  Scrutiny of Facebook has intensified following reports that it failed to prevent the data mining firm Cambridge Analytica from amassing personal information about millions of users   possibly used to aid Donald Trump s campaign   and that the social network has been collecting Android users  phone call and text message histories without notice  That adds to criticism that Facebook manipulates its users and has allowed Russian bots to divide Americans by spreading false information On Monday  the Federal Trade Commission announced it was investigating Facebook for its privacy practices Zuckerberg preaches transparency  but flinches at questioning  He is undeniably brilliant  but stubborn about acknowledging the extent of Facebook s problems Is he prepared to do all it will take the right the ship  If he fails to do it  it may take a while but eventually people are going to rebel   said Roger McNamee  an early Facebook investor and adviser who has become a pointed critic  I thought Facebook was a force for good in the world for a really long time   McNamee said   I think it s really hard to make that case today  Days after Trump s election  Zuckerberg was pressed on the possibility that foreign agents had used his social network to divide voters  The idea that fake news on Facebook     influenced the election in any way  I think  is a pretty crazy idea   the CEO said at a technology conference  I think all of us were shocked to learn how wrong he was   said David Kirkpatrick  the author of a 2010 book about Facebook who questioned Zuckerberg that day Zuckerberg walked back the remark soon after  continuing a years long routine of self correction  But errors that reflect his stubbornness  those who know him say  are tempered by an eagerness to learn and a deep sense of reflection Naomi Gleit  Facebook s longest serving employee after the CEO  said Zuckerberg   who declined an interview request from The Associated Press   has talked about making the world a better place since he was 21  But his view of his place in that world seemed like  a burden of responsibility   she said With Zuckerberg   its experiment  learn  experiment  learn   said LinkedIn co founder Reid Hoffman  who has known him since 2004 But in the process of learning  Zuckerberg s inexperience has sometimes played out in public view  such as when he donated  100 million to Newark  New Jersey  schools in 2010 with few specifics outlining how the money should be spent  He was just a very young  naive  inexperienced guy who was brilliant     but just really didn t know much about how the world worked   said Dale Russakoff  author of  The Prize   a book chronicling the Newark experiment Zuckerberg and his wife  Priscilla Chan  have since chartered their own foundation to take on mammoth goals  like a  3 billion investment to cure  prevent or manage all diseases To free up his fortune for philanthropy  Zuckerberg last year pushed board members to restructure Facebook s stock  allowing him to sell off part of his stake while maintaining control  That prompted a suit by a group of shareholders who argued that the move would benefit only Zuckerberg while diluting the value of other investors  stakes  The company dropped the plan The gambit hints at the complexity of being Zuckerberg  who advocates for transparency and community but whose individual interests don t always align Zuckerberg  who has 105 million Facebook  friends   is compelled to share far more about himself than would be expected of another CEO  Yet he fiercely guards his privacy  Intellectually  he believes in transparency   Kirkpatrick said   But emotionally  it s very difficult for him  Shortly before the 2016 election  McNamee sent a letter to Zuckerberg and Facebook s chief operating officer  Sheryl Sandberg  warning the company was being manipulated in ways its creators never intended  It wasn t just about the U S  election  A consulting firm had collected data on people interested in the Black Lives Matter movement and sold it to police departments  and critics had detected a well organized  clandestine campaign supporting Brexit McNamee said he has been disappointed in the incremental changes announced since  but Zuckerberg s supporters say he is unfairly blamed Hoffman  the LinkedIn co founder  credits him with leading Facebook through a shift in mindset  nudging users into a more positive virtual environment   without completely shutting out inflammatory content Kirkpatrick argues  though  that Zuckerberg still must deal with existential threats to Facebook s business   its potential to negatively affect democracy and the way it hooks in users  I do not think he has yet grasped the gravity with which his service is being perceived to be a socially harmful force all around the world  And I also don t think he realizes the extent to which that really is true  McNamee  recalling Zuckerberg as a 22 year old visionary  said the CEO must be willing to rethink long held assumptions  But that does not mean he has to abandon building his global community  You ve achieved more than your wildest dreams   McNamee said he would tell Zuckerberg if asked again for his counsel   You re a billionaire  Now you have a chance to be a hero  "
" Silicon Valley  returns to HBO Sunday after a particularly terrible week for Silicon Valley  as Facebook dealt with fallout from revelations about the Cambridge Analytica data breach and Uber notched a horrific milestone  The first pedestrian killed by a driverless car  The tech world of four or five years ago is definitely different than now   said Mike Judge  the creator of the show  The public conception of Silicon Valley as a place of whiz kids in hoodies  boldly claiming all the time that they were making the world a better place  has been replaced with something darker  he said For its fifth season  TV s  Silicon Valley  has undergone changes of its own  albeit of the less tragic variety  The largely luckless Pied Piper crew finally finds itself in charge  as well as a man down  T  J  Miller  the excitable comic who played the feckless blowhard Erlich Bachman  last seen in a Tibetan opium den in Season 4  left the show  bashing colleagues in interviews on the way out   In December  after Mr  Miller had quit the series  he was the subject of sexual assault allegations involving a former college classmate  he has denied the allegations  Mr  Judge was previously best known for creating the long running  King of the Hill  as well as diverse cult favorites that have had equally lengthy afterlives  like  Beavis and Butt Head    Office Space  and  Idiocracy   The new direction of  Silicon Valley   along with the changes and struggles in the tech world  has him reassessing his original plan to end the show after six seasons   It s taken on a second wind   he said  How many seasons did  Dallas  go   he added   I think it could go that long    For the record  14  In a phone conversation  Mr  Judge discussed the new season  Mr  Miller s departure  possible reboots of  King of the Hill  and  Idiocracy  and which of his creations are his favorites  These are edited excerpts from the conversation For the first time  the Pied Piper crew is running things  Did that change how you approached the story It felt pretty natural  In a way  some of this to me is analogous to stuff that happens in Hollywood  I started out making animated shorts in my house by myself  Then when  Beavis and Butt Head  happened  I had people fighting over it   there was the stress of  am I getting screwed here  And eventually I had about as many people working for me on  Beavis and Butt Head  as Richard  Thomas Middleditch  does in Season 5  and that became just as stressful  I m not someone who enjoys telling people to do something they don t want to do  and Richard is the same way  So there s plenty of comedy that can come from stuff like that How did T  J  Miller s departure affect the show Had he left after Season 1 or 2  it would have been really rough to try to make it work  But now it s actually kind of perfect timing because we were having trouble keeping him in the story  Not because of him  just because his character is not a programmer  He s just the guy who owned the house  We had done a bunch of comedy about that  about how he s kind of marginal and trying to make himself relevant  We have a lot of really great characters and actors  and I try to service them all  So it actually freed us up in the writing   Mr  Judge declined to comment on reports that Mr  Miller had been a disruptive presence on the set  What did you make of his bomb throwing exit   Laughs   It seemed very much like T  J    I m sure he wouldn t have it any other way  He s a brilliantly funny guy  I ve seen these quotes   he s always been a good put down artist  But yeah  I don t know what to really make of it  and it s not any of my business anymore  you know Jian Yang  Jimmy O  Yang  has been the new  expletive  of the house for a while  and he becomes a bigger one  like on a grander scale  And there are a lot of other characters picking up the slack  Laurie  Suzanne Cryer   there s more of her and Monica  Amanda Crew   There s definitely a lot more Jared  Zach Woods   And we ve got a really great robot coming up The show started off making fun of the goofy grandiosity of the tech industry  but the current perception of Silicon Valley is more critical  Has the show changed as a result Because we write it several months ahead of when it airs  we were already kind of noticing  just because we talk to a lot of people  in the industry  and a lot of them are just starting to realize the lack of conscience  And if they re not realizing that  people are pointing it out to them  I noticed when I worked in the tech world that there s just this belief that every gain they make is for the good of mankind  and never really questioning it  I m not saying they re all horrible people  but they look at the task at hand and don t really consider whether it s right or wrong Or whether people want their data to be sold to political operatives Yeah  and actually we deal with that this season  with what Richard s building  It s like that quote  If you re getting the service for free  then you re the product  Those servers and all the infrastructure and engineers cost money  So  you re paying by them looking for keywords in your email and popping ads up Which is familiar to anyone who s had a sneaker ad follow them around online Yeah a friend of mine told me through text message what hotel he was going to be staying at in Nashville  and the next thing I know  there s an ad for it on my Facebook page  It s all tied together Fox has said it wants to bring back  King of the Hill   Would you be involved in that Yeah  if they did  There have been a couple discussions about it  and about how we would do it  but nothing concrete yet  I think you d have to have Bobby and all of them be older  The Simpsons are such iconic characters  Bart could be that age forever because it s a more surreal show  But with  King of the Hill  being on 13 years  I think people were really starting to wonder why Bobby s still the same age Another old film of yours   Idiocracy   from 2006  has become a common reference point for  well  many things happening right now  Do people mention this to you On Twitter  like all day long  There was at one point talk about possibly a series  an animated series  a reboot like that  There were talks of musicals  I would like to have another stab at it one way or another  It was almost like a bigger concept than it was a movie   it was difficult to make and probably should have been a TV show  But yeah  I get it all the time  which is nice  But I don t really know what to make of it  or how much of it relates to the movie when people throw around the word  idiocracy  on Twitter Well when the C E O  of Carl s Jr  gets nominated for a cabinet position  That s what was really weird for me  specific things like that  There s Carl s Jr   The company had a notably unflattering presence in the film   There was the W W E  thing   The president in the movie was a former professional wrestler  in real life  President Trump appeared in a World Wrestling Entertainment match in 2007  Even when we were shooting the movie  the wardrobe designer showed me these shoes   they weren t out in the world yet  And she said   This is a start up  they re making these shoes and they re going to look completely ridiculous   Plastic shoes with holes in them  And I said to her   The only thing I m worried about is  what if these things blow up and by the time the movie comes out  they re everywhere   And she said   Oh  that s never going to happen  No one is going to buy these things   And then  the movie comes out  and they are all wearing Crocs  and those shoes were just becoming huge  So  I think that was a sign that maybe a lot of these dumb things are going to come to pass It was the Croc in the coal mine  Laughs   Oh man You have a remarkable track record of creating things that seem to stick with people  whether it s  Idiocracy  or  Office Space  or characters like Hank and Bobby Hill  Do you have a personal favorite That s a hard one to pick  I m probably a little partial to Beavis  Beavis and Butt Head  but mostly Beavis  I d say Lumbergh  from  Office Space   is another one  I d say those two probably come to mind the most because   well  I don t know Well for Lumbergh   I m old enough to remember when an office job sounded great  I worked at Jack in the Box and worked construction  those kinds of jobs  and I remember thinking   Oh my God  you can work in an office  That would be wonderful   And then the first time I did it  I had that type of boss   that passive aggressive boss  I would rather have a guy yelling at me on a construction site  I had done an animated version but the way Gary Cole played that character  I thought that was something really great that hadn t been done yet  So  I don t know  I m pretty proud of that one "
"John R  Bolton is hardly known for sugarcoating his views  He once derided the United Nations by citing its 38 story headquarters in New York   If it lost 10 stories   he said   it wouldn t make a bit of difference  As it happened  Mr  Bolton went on to serve as the United States ambassador to the United Nations  perhaps the most undiplomatic of diplomats  But if President Trump wanted a national security adviser who would match his blunt  hard edge  confrontational approach to the world  then Mr  Bolton fits the bill With his trademark bushy gray mustache and his take no prisoners style  Mr  Bolton positioned himself to the right even of the foreign policy veterans who emerged from President George W  Bush s administration  a hawk among hawks  a hard liner who thrills conservatives and chills moderates and liberals  From his perch on Fox News  he has impressed Mr  Trump with a muscular vision of American power and a dark assessment of America s adversaries When he takes over as Mr  Trump s third national security adviser in 14 months  Mr  Bolton will almost surely encourage Mr  Trump s instincts against diplomatic agreements both consider weak and unwise  He shares the president s derisive opinion of the Iran nuclear deal and will presumably prod him to scrap it when a May deadline arrives  He likewise takes a dim view of international agreements like the Paris climate change accord  from which Mr  Trump announced last year that he would withdraw the United States  He has called the  two state solution  for Israel and the Palestinians dead But Mr  Bolton is not always in step with a president who sometimes veers back and forth between threatening  fire and fury  and eagerly seeking talks with foreign leaders  Mr  Bolton argues the virtues of pre emptive military action against North Korea and scorns diplomacy of the sort Mr  Trump has embarked on with Kim Jong un  He promotes more punitive sanctions against Russia rather than the kind of hand holding flattery of President Vladimir V  Putin that Mr  Trump practiced even this week  He supported the Iraq war  which Mr  Trump calls a catastrophic mistake In an interview on Thursday evening on Fox  Mr  Bolton said he recognized that his role would be to play the honest broker bringing different views to the president  and that it would be up to Mr  Trump to make the decisions But he made clear that he also planned to be Mr  Trump s enforcer  When the president makes a decision  he said  part of his job will be  making sure the bureaucracies get the decision and implement it  Mr  Bolton criticized the frequent leaks out of Mr  Trump s national security team  saying that a president cannot conduct diplomacy  if some munchkin in the White House  is leaking information to the news media   Leaking of that sort is simply unacceptable   he said Mr  Bolton s appointment elicited mixed reviews   Selecting John Bolton as national security adviser is good news for America s allies and bad news for America s enemies   said Senator Lindsey Graham  Republican of South Carolina   He has a firm understanding of the threats we face from North Korea  Iran and radical Islam  Critics  however  expressed concern that a bomb thrower in words could become a bomb thrower in deeds   Bolton played a key role in politicizing the intel that misled us into the Iraq War   Senator Edward J  Markey  Democrat of Massachusetts  wrote on Twitter   We cannot let this extreme war hawk blunder us into another terrible conflict  Clifford Kupchan  the chairman of the Eurasia Group  a consultant firm  sent a note to clients warning that Mr  Bolton s appointment  increases risk across the board   adding that it  makes U S  foreign policy  America First on Steroids   At one point  Mr  Bolton toyed with running for president himself  only to back off  Instead  he created an organization to support like minded candidates  His  super PAC  was one of the earliest customers of Cambridge Analytica  which has found itself confronting a deepening crisis after reports last weekend that the firm had harvested the data from more than 50 million Facebook profiles in its bid to develop techniques for predicting the behavior of individual American voters The firm was founded with a  15 million investment from Robert Mercer  the wealthy Republican donor who has backed both Mr  Bolton s PAC and Mr  Trump  Cambridge s so called psychographic modeling techniques  which were built in part with the data harvested from Facebook  underpinned its work for the Trump campaign in 2016  setting off a furious debate about the merits of the firm s methods  The same techniques were also the focus of its work for Mr  Bolton s PAC Using the psychographic models  the company designed advertisements from candidates supported by Mr  Bolton s PAC  including the 2014 campaign of Thom Tillis  the Republican senator from North Carolina  One advertisement  a video that was posted on YouTube  was aimed at fearful and neurotic voters   it emphasized security and the idea that Mr  Tillis could keep the United States safe Mr  Bolton also recorded a video used by a Russian gun rights group in 2013 to encourage Moscow to loosen gun laws  according to a report by NPR  The report said the video was part of an effort by Russian and American gun rights groups to collaborate in the years leading up to the 2016 election A native of Baltimore  Mr  Bolton  69  received undergraduate and law degrees from Yale University  In between stints in private practice  he took a series of increasingly important jobs in government  starting at the United States Agency for International Development under President Ronald Reagan and later as an assistant attorney general After the 2000 election  Mr  Bolton joined the Republican legal team in Florida during the recount battle between Mr  Bush and Vice President Al Gore  After the Supreme Court halted the recount  resulting in Mr  Bush s victory  Dick Cheney  the new vice president  persuaded the incoming secretary of state  Colin L  Powell  to make Mr  Bolton an under secretary in charge of arms control  In that role  he helped pull the United States out of the Antiballistic Missile treaty but negotiated a separate treaty with Russia paring nuclear arsenals When Condoleezza Rice succeeded Mr  Powell  she rebuffed pressure from Mr  Cheney to make Mr  Bolton her deputy  Instead  Mr  Bush nominated him for the United Nations post  but key Republicans opposed him  including a former assistant secretary of state who testified that Mr  Bolton was a  kiss up  kick down sort of guy  who abused underlings After the Senate refused to confirm Mr  Bolton  Mr  Bush gave him a recess appointment instead   a decision he would come to regret  Mr  Bolton clashed regularly with Ms  Rice and  after leaving office  broke with Mr  Bush over what he saw as weak kneed policies on North Korea and Iran He titled his memoir  Surrender Is Not an Option   and called the Foreign Service officers in the State Department s East Asian and Pacific Affairs Bureau the  EAPeasers   He even went after Mr  Bush   Nothing can erase the ineffable sadness of an American presidency  like this one  in total intellectual collapse   he wrote in The Wall Street Journal Mr  Bush bristled and  in a private meeting with a group of conservatives  said   Let me just say from the outset that I don t consider Bolton credible   Other former colleagues fought back more publicly  Christopher Hill  who negotiated with North Korea for Mr  Bush  dismissed Mr  Bolton as  Phyllis Schlafly with a mustache  After Mr  Trump s election in 2016  Ms  Rice and other Bush administration veterans like former Defense Secretary Robert M  Gates and Stephen J  Hadley  the former national security adviser  privately warned against an appointment for Mr  Bolton Mr  Trump considered Mr  Bolton for several posts but ultimately backed away each time  Unlike some of them  national security adviser does not require Senate confirmation  In the interim  Mr  Bolton has repeatedly praised Mr  Trump on television and in his Wall Street Journal columns even when the two disagreed He wrote on Twitter this month that sanctions on Mr  Putin and his inner circle needed to be tougher   If you want to punish a country for behavior you don t accept  you need punishing sanctions that are broad  not targeted  and they need to be enforced   he wrote In a Journal column  he made the case for a pre emptive military strike against North Korea   Given the gaps in U S  intelligence about North Korea  we should not wait until the very last minute   he wrote   That would risk striking after the North has deliverable nuclear weapons  a much more dangerous situation   Other options  he told a reporter  would be persuading China to topple North Korea s government or reuniting the peninsula under South Korean rule  although he acknowledged neither was likely A couple of weeks ago  he went on Fox to disdain South Korea s willingness to negotiate with North Korea   They re like putty in North Korea s hands   he said   As the great international relations theorist P  T  Barnum put it  there s a sucker born every minute   Two days later  Mr  Trump accepted an invitation to meet with North Korea s Mr  Kim As he prepared to take on his new assignment  however  Mr  Bolton was careful to minimize any differences with Mr  Trump  Asked Thursday evening on Fox about the president s decision to congratulate Mr  Putin on winning an election that most of the world considered a sham  Mr  Bolton said   I don t consider it a significant point one way or the other   adding   it s a matter of being polite  "
"As questions mounted last year about whether Facebook had been exploited to tilt the U S  presidential election  Mark Zuckerberg s to do list landed him on a fishing trawler off Alabama s Gulf coast But the chatter surrounding the CEO s arrival in port was that it signaled something bigger than just the start of a 30 state personal tour  his designs on a job even more powerful than leading the social network that links 2 2 billion people worldwide  It was one of the last things I asked him  thinking it would put a smile on his face   and it did   said Dominick Ficarino  who owns a shrimp business in Bayou La Batre  Alabama  and hosted a dockside lunch for Zuckerberg that Sunday afternoon  I asked him if he was interested in running for president of the United States  And his answer to me was   Can I answer you with a question  If you were me  would you   Thirteen months later  Zuckerberg no longer has the luxury of mulling a hypothetical next act  Instead  he is grappling with a crisis that has enveloped the company synonymous with his face and name  It does not help that the most glaring reminder of Facebook s flaws is the unabated uproar over the American presidency itself  The world feels anxious and divided  and Facebook has a lot of work to do   Zuckerberg wrote in January  laying out the  personal challenge  that he sets for himself each year In 2017  the billionaire challenged himself to travel to every state he d never visited  This year  long after critics began demanding an overhaul  Zuckerberg said his personal goal is to  fix  the platform that he has engineered to build community   but that is increasingly blamed for warping it Yet things continue to get worse  Scrutiny of Facebook has intensified following reports that it failed to prevent the data mining firm Cambridge Analytica from amassing personal information about millions of users   possibly used to aid Donald Trump s campaign   and that the social network has been collecting Android users  phone call and text message histories without notice  That adds to criticism that Facebook manipulates its users and has allowed Russian bots to divide Americans by spreading false information On Monday  the Federal Trade Commission announced it was investigating Facebook for its privacy practices Throughout the mounting crisis  Zuckerberg s response has been a study in contradictions  He crisscrossed the country  even as his company back home came under increasing fire  He preaches transparency  but flinches at questioning and craves privacy  He is undeniably brilliant  but stubborn in his reluctance to acknowledge the extent of Facebook s problems Even his critics say he is uniquely capable of righting the ship  But at 33  is he prepared to do all it will take  If he fails to do it  it may take a while but eventually people are going to rebel   said Roger McNamee  an early Facebook investor and adviser who has become one of the company s most pointed critics  I thought Facebook was a force for good in the world for a really long time   McNamee said   I think it s really hard to make that case today     Days after Trump s election  Zuckerberg was pressed on the possibility that foreign agents had used his social network to divide voters  The idea that fake news on Facebook     influenced the election in any way  I think  is a pretty crazy idea   the CEO told the audience at a California technology conference  I think all of us were shocked to learn how wrong he was   said David Kirkpatrick  the author of a 2010 book about Facebook who questioned Zuckerberg that day   You can certainly say that he was culpable  in that he was naive and inattentive to what was happening in his system  But I don t think he was lying  Zuckerberg walked back the remark soon after  continuing a years long routine of self correction  But errors that reflect his stubbornness  those who know him say  are tempered by an eagerness to learn from mistakes and a deep sense of reflection Donald Graham  the former chairman of the Washington Post Co   recalled that when he met Zuckerberg in 2005  outsiders still weren t sure what to make of Facebook  I would ask him a question and he would pause long enough   15 seconds  20 seconds   that I would think  Did I insult him  Did he not hear me    said Graham  who went on to serve on the company s board from 2008 to 2015  Since I am from Washington  I m not used to people thinking before they are answering a question      But Mark  then as now  was thinking about the right answer  Zuckerberg s boyish appearance  even today  is a reminder of just how young he was when he created what would become the world s biggest social network  back in his dorm room at Harvard  I didn t know anything about building a company or global internet service   he wrote in January   Over the years I ve made almost every mistake you can imagine  Naomi Gleit  Facebook s longest serving employee after the CEO  said Zuckerberg   who declined an interview request from The Associated Press   has been talking about making the world a better place since he was 21  But his view of that world and his place in it  seemed almost like a gravity  a burden of responsibility   she said That seriousness coincides with a sense of certainty Gleit recalled Zuckerberg s steadfast attachment to a Facebook message service similar to email  even as more people began using phones to send text messages  But co workers eventually swayed the CEO  whom she described as a  learn it all   That change of mind informed Facebook s 2014 purchase of the WhatsApp messaging service for  19 billion  I think he would even say now that he was initially wrong   Gleit said With Zuckerberg   it s experiment  learn  experiment  learn   said LinkedIn co founder Reid Hoffman  who has known him since 2004  Hoffman said that is evident in Zuckerberg s enthusiasm for software  which can be overwritten to fix problems  That facility  he said  makes Zuckerberg the equal of executives with far more experience But in the process of learning  Zuckerberg s inexperience has sometimes played out in public view    In 2010  Zuckerberg announced on Oprah Winfrey s television show that he would donate  100 million to schools in Newark  New Jersey Critics labeled it an attempt to polish his image  just as the biopic  The Social Network  was being released  Still  there was little questioning his generosity  The problem was that Zuckerberg   who knew little about education   made the gift with few specifics outlining how it should be spent  He was just a very young  naive  inexperienced guy who was brilliant at technology and computers and the internet  but just really didn t know much about how the world worked   said Dale Russakoff  author of  The Prize   a book chronicling how the money went to high priced consultants  with minimal effort by leaders to build community support By the end of the process  Zuckerberg had developed a clearer understanding of how to get things done  He and his wife  Dr  Priscilla Chan  have since chartered their own foundation and structured it to take on mammoth goals  like a  3 billion investment to cure  prevent or manage all diseases  He has pledged to donate 99 percent of his Facebook stock to philanthropy  Zuck s maturation has occurred in front of the public   said Kirkpatrick  author of  The Facebook Effect  The Inside Story of the Company that Is Connecting the World     But he also still lives with the consequences of the decisions he made when he was less mature  At Facebook  Zuckerberg has grown increasingly bold in using huge sums of money to pursue corporate goals  which includes purchasing competitors   or companies that could grow into competitors Facebook s  1 billion purchase of Instagram in 2012   then unprofitable and little known   came as a shock to Wall Street  Two years later came the multibillion dollar deal to buy WhatsApp  a company that remains unprofitable but has given Facebook a prime portal into developing countries and other regions outside the U S In 2014  soon after Facebook bought a virtual reality firm called Oculus  Zuckerberg found himself being grilled in a lawsuit brought by a competitor who accused an Oculus executive of stealing trade secrets  Under questioning  he talked about the pressure he exerted to make the Oculus deal happen  and his vision of growing it so fast  that we can get every developer and studio in the world building just for Oculus before any big competitor exists  Last year  in a bid to free up his fortune for philanthropy  Zuckerberg pushed board members to restructure Facebook s stock  allowing him to sell off part of his stake while maintaining control  That prompted a suit by a group of shareholders who argued that the move would benefit only Zuckerberg while diluting the value of other investors  stakes  Days before Zuckerberg was scheduled to testify as part of the suit  the company dropped the plan The gambit hints at the complexity of being Zuckerberg  who advocates for transparency and the interests of the community but whose individual interests don t always align The paradox is self inflicted  the trade off for creating a venture premised on users  willingness to share details of their lives  That requires Zuckerberg  who has 105 million Facebook  friends   to reveal far more about himself than would be expected of any other CEO  whether it s photos of him and Chan baking sweets for the Jewish holiday of Purim or dressing their daughters for the Chinese New Year Yet he fiercely guards his privacy When calls went out last year for Zuckerberg to testify before a Senate committee  the company sent its lawyer  And when he and Chan bought 700 acres on the Hawaiian island of Kauai last year  they quietly filed lawsuits against hundreds of Hawaiians   withdrawn after protests   that would have cut off locals  access to the land by negating their interest in small ancestral tracts within the estate s boundaries  Intellectually  he believes in transparency   Kirkpatrick said   But emotionally  it s very difficult for him      Facebook works hard to present Zuckerberg as someone deeply interested in the ordinary people whose lives are at the heart of its business Stops on last year s U S  tour  never announced  were set up by facilitators who revealed details to only a select few  But many of the visits were covered by the media and documented in professional quality photos on Zuckerberg s Facebook page soon after he d departed Ostensibly  the idea was for Zuckerberg to learn  But in their brief interactions  many people were just as interested in finding a way to connect with him In Hazard  Kentucky  educator Paul Green became custodian of the small town s biggest secret  A staffer from Zuckerberg s foundation  peppering Green with questions about the region s educational cooperative  finally admitted it was because the CEO himself wanted to visit  Green s reward for keeping it quiet was seeing the wide eyed grins when Zuckerberg pulled up and greeted local high schoolers studying robotics and programming Walking through science demonstrations  Zuckerberg spent more time trading tech tales with the teenagers than quizzing the teachers  He just lit up with those kids   Green said   The way he talked with them about some of the things he did when he was in school and his passion for technology  it really was cool  When Zuckerberg toured an oil rig near Williston  North Dakota  last July   from the minute he got out of the car to the minute he got back in the car  he was nothing but questions   said Ron Ness  president of the North Dakota Petroleum Council  which arranged the visit  I had Bakken shale  limestone  dolomite  and he was able to hold them in his hand  along with a bottle of crude oil  And I remember him asking   How do you get that oil out of that rock    geologist Kathleen Neset said In Dayton  Ohio  Zuckerberg met with officials  caregivers and families battling drug addiction  Lori Erion  the founder of the group Families of Addicts  said she told him what it was like to learn her daughter  April  had shot up heroin in their own home  It seemed to get him really emotional   Erion said  recalling how Zuckerberg stood up suddenly and told the group he needed a few minutes to steady himself  When he returned  he asked what makes an addict stay clean and how families got their loved ones into treatment  We didn t ever talk about Facebook at all   Erion said   which is really interesting because Facebook is really the main way of us getting information out  He really was just like a regular person     As Zuckerberg connected with Americans face to face  controversy over Facebook continued to spiral Shortly before the election  McNamee sent a letter to Zuckerberg and Facebook s chief operating officer  Sheryl Sandberg  warning that Facebook was being manipulated in ways its creators never intended  It wasn t just about the U S  election  A consulting firm had collected data on people interested in the Black Lives Matter movement and sold it to police departments  and critics had detected a well organized  clandestine campaign supporting Brexit All this pointed to a deep problem with Facebook   that it was simply not equipped or not willing to prevent the misuse of its platform McNamee said he has been disappointed in the incremental changes announced since Facebook has adopted this  libertarian philosophy that says  we are not responsible for anything downstream  we are allowed to disrupt media  we are allowed to addict our users and we are not responsible for any of the consequences of any of that    he said Zuckerberg could change that  But McNamee said it is not enough to hire thousands of workers to weed through fake and abusive posts if those posts keep getting through  And tweaking Facebook s newsfeed so users see more posts from families and friends does not address his certainty that the algorithms underlying Facebook make it dangerously addictive  You cannot cure addiction by doing more of the thing that got you addicted in the first place  which is what Zuck recommends   McNamee wrote in an email Critics say Facebook continues to ignore the possibility of the social network being used for dark purposes  but Zuckerberg s supporters counter that he is unfairly blamed for problems he could not have foreseen Hoffman  the LinkedIn co founder  credits Zuckerberg with leading Facebook through a shift in mindset  making changes that will nudge users into a more positive virtual environment   without completely shutting out inflammatory content  Facebook basically is saying we enable people based on the way they behave  That s a very democratic argument  If people want to live in filter bubbles  who are we to say  Don t live in filter bubbles   even though we don t want them to   Hoffman said But Kirkpatrick argued that Zuckerberg s and Sandberg s surety that Facebook has a positive impact on society has blinded them to parallel realities  The company can t be fixed  Kirkpatrick said  until Zuckerberg comes to terms with existential threats to the way the social network does business   its potential to negatively affect democracy and the way it hooks in users  There s no question in my mind that Mark Zuckerberg is an ethical and responsible human being who wants to do the right thing   he said   However  I do not think he has yet grasped the gravity with which his service is being perceived to be a socially harmful force all around the world  And I also don t think he realizes the extent to which that really is true  McNamee  recalling Zuckerberg as a 22 year old visionary  said the CEO must be willing to rethink long held assumptions  But that does not mean he has to abandon building his global community  You ve won   McNamee said he would tell Zuckerberg if asked again for his counsel  You ve achieved more than your wildest dreams  You re a billionaire  Now you have a chance to be a hero  "
"MENLO PARK  Calif    John Tenanes  Facebook s vice president for real estate  is showing off the company s plans for expansion  It will have offices for thousands of programmers to extend Facebook s fearsome reach  But that is not what Mr  Tenanes is excited about He leans over a scale model of the 59 acre site  which is named Willow Village   There will be housing there   he points   There will be a retail street along here  with a grocery store and a drugstore  That round building in the corner  Maybe a cultural center  In just a few years  Facebook built a virtual community that linked more than two billion people  an achievement with few precedents  Now the social network is building a real community  the kind you can walk around  It is a project with many precedents in American history  quite a few of them cautionary tales about what happens when a powerful corporation takes control of civic life Facebook  Mr  Tenanes says  has a dual mission   We want to balance our growth with the community s needs  Willow Village will be wedged between the Menlo Park neighborhood of Belle Haven and the city of East Palo Alto  both heavily Hispanic communities that are among Silicon Valley s poorest  Facebook is planning 1 500 apartments  and has agreed with Menlo Park to offer 225 of them at below market rates  The most likely tenants of the full price units are Facebook employees  who already receive a five figure bonus if they live near the office The community will have eight acres of parks  plazas and bike pedestrian paths open to the public  Facebook wants to revitalize the railway running alongside the property and will finish next year a pedestrian bridge over the expressway  The bridge will provide access to the trail that rings San Francisco Bay  a boon for birders and bikers Mr  Tenanes contemplates the audacity of building a city  It s a good thing  right   he says Depends how it goes  Facebook is testing the proposition  Do people love tech companies so much they will live inside of them  When the project was announced last summer  critics dubbed it Facebookville or  in tribute to company co founder Mark Zuckerberg  Zucktown The company has not warmed to these names   I owe my soul to the company store   Tennessee Ernie Ford sang  But Facebook s ambitions are now confronting a more urgent problem  an escalating crisis over the company s power to sway elections  its casual approach to data privacy and its susceptibility to Russian manipulation  If Facebook s image is permanently sullied by the furor over Cambridge Analytica  the data firm hired by President Trump s 2016 election campaign  Zucktown will falter before it is finished The social media colossus is not the only Big Tech company in the complicated position of dressing up its expansion as a gift to its neighbors A few miles down the 101 highway  another new civic corporate partnership is underway in the city of Mountain View  Google is promising to place the public  in the very heart of Google s vibrant community  The search company plans a 600 000 square foot office building with a roof that melts up into soft peaks  kind of like a meringue  It will have stores  cafes  gardens and even a space for theatrical performances  as well as a place for consumers to test drive new Google technology Google will build 5 000 homes on its property under an agreement brokered with Mountain View in December  Call it Alphabet City as a nod to Alphabet  Google s corporate parent  The company said it was still figuring out its future as a landlord  and declined further comment Zucktown and Alphabet City  as well as similar projects being contemplated across Silicon Valley  could at a minimum have consequences for the start up culture that transformed fruit orchards into the world s greatest tech hub  Silicon Valley was built by engineers jumping from company to company  That drove the innovation that sped the rise of some firms and hastened the demise of others As workers begin to literally live at the office  they will inevitably be more beholden to bosses who also collect the rent  After all  it is much harder to find a place to live in Silicon Valley than a new job  Turnover may slump  and so might the turnover in ideas The push into the physical also has implications for the 1 2 million people in Silicon Valley who are teachers  fitness instructors  clerks  baristas   all those who hold jobs that do not come with stock options  As they inch down the clogged streets and bid money they don t have on miserable houses  they will hear the siren call of Big Tech  We can fix broken communities by building new ones  Trust us  Corporations are paying for things that the city or county and state used to pay for   said Cecilia Taylor of Belle Haven Action  a community advocacy group   They have a lot of money  A lot of money  More than the city does  And a lot more power  On a wall in the Facebook division charged with the company s growth there is a poster with a classic tech admonition   Go Big or Go Home   Facebook is in essence tweaking that to  Go Big at Home   About 12 000 of its 25 000 employees work in Menlo Park  In a decade  it will have space for 35 000   slightly more than the city s current population The notion of communities run by and for companies has been a fixture in the United States almost from the beginning  Often these places were exercises in plunder In the textile town of Lowell  Mass   in 1846  the mill clock slowed down to lengthen shifts and then sped up at night when the workers were off  according to one contemporary reformer  U S  Steel built Gary  Ind   but took little responsibility for its employees  many of whom lived in substandard housing in crime ridden neighborhoods There were more benign examples too  Milton Hershey began building a chocolate factory in the middle of Pennsylvania in 1903 and then surrounded it with a community where  he pledged  there would be  no poverty  no nuisances  no evil   In return for surrendering certain rights   like local elections and privacy   workers in the town of Hershey got medical coverage  a free junior college  parks and a zoo Corporate good will  however  had a way of curdling over time In Wisconsin  the Kohler family established a plumbing fixtures factory in 1900 and then created a town around it  Kohler built houses for couples and dorms for single men  financed schools  had a pension plan and paid well  When economic conditions deteriorated during the Depression  however  the employees tried to strike  Kohler responded by arming its deputies with machine guns  In the ensuing clash  more than 40 strikers were shot and two were killed By the 1960s  the era of the company town in America was fading  even as countries like China picked up the notion  Zhengzhou is a remote Chinese city that was once impoverished  It now has 350 000 workers building iPhones Hardy Green  author of  The Company Town  The Industrial Edens and Satanic Mills That Shaped the American Economy   said that the tech companies had been reviving elements of the company town in the United States for years now The free meals  nap pods  concierge services  yoga classes  on site laundry and haircuts are a perk but also a modern way of slowing down the mill clock so the workers can spend more time working  But in a society where government is increasingly ineffective  company towns are nevertheless likely to be welcomed  or at least tolerated  It may be the best option for many  just as a benevolent dictatorship can be O K  for as long as the benevolence lasts   Mr  Green said Only seven years ago  Silicon Valley had a very different attitude about building housing for workers  much less the community  A gaunt Steve Jobs  in what would turn out to be his last public appearance  made his case before the Cupertino City Council for a new Apple headquarters Mr  Jobs told council members how great the new doughnut shaped headquarters was going to be  It would have a lot of trees  a theater  curved windows  Architecture students would come from all over to study it City Council member Kris Wang had a question  How could the 60 000 Cupertino residents benefit from this new campus  We d like to continue to stay here and pay taxes   Mr  Jobs said   If we can t  we d have to go somewhere like Mountain View  Ms  Wang  a former Cupertino mayor  persisted   Do we get free Wi Fi or something like that   I m a simpleton   Mr  Jobs replied   I always had this view that we pay taxes and the city should do those things  That s why we pay taxes  If we can get out of paying taxes I d be glad to put up a Wi Fi network  Since that June 2011 meeting  the number of hours commuters in Silicon Valley lose every day to congestion has doubled to 66 000  About 300 000 new jobs have been created  pushing the median apartment rental rate up 37 percent and the median cost of a home to  968 000 Meanwhile  the big companies   not only Apple but Amazon  which has an increasingly large presence in Silicon Valley  as well as Facebook and Google   are much wealthier Apple built a  5 billion campus that  for all its splendor  is not readily accessible by mass transit  That problem was compounded by the company s apparent lack of interest in where its new employees would live  Decisions like these are no longer acceptable from a public relations point of view  and would not be smart for the companies in any case  If Silicon Valley continues choking on its traffic  the companies will find hiring not merely difficult but impossible  Even for a tech programmer  a  2 million house is a hurdle So the virtual companies are being forced to grapple with the most intractable physical issues  I don t think Google  for instance  thought they were going to have to get into the transportation business   said Allison Arieff  editorial director of San Francisco Bay Area Planning and Urban Research Association  a research organization   But they now have a giant swath of the company devoted to getting people around  Housing seems the next step  No one bats an eye if universities build housing for students  grad students and tenured professors  When the tech companies played a much smaller role in Silicon Valley 25 years ago  even the working class could afford to live here  So could Stanford University students  Traffic flowed naturally However enticing this past might seem  efforts to put the brakes on growth have had limited success Measure M  a 2014 effort to restrict development in Menlo Park s downtown  was soundly defeated by voters  Patti Fry  a former chairwoman of the Menlo Park City Planning Commission and an architect of the measure  said she is wary of Facebook s increasing size and power  They re doing more than most companies  but most of what they do serves them   she said   I do not expect a company to have as a priority providing community services that a real community needs  They re in business to be in business  Drew Combs is a former journalist who became a member of the Menlo Park Planning Commission and then ran for City Council in 2014  He was loosely associated with Measure M and when it failed  so did his bid  He is now chairman of the planning commission  which reviews the use permits required for large projects  I don t think in a lot of cases this is a good versus evil battle   Mr  Combs said   This is a negotiation between different stakeholders  Mr  Combs has since gotten a new job  He now works at Facebook  He recuses himself when Facebook issues come up before the commission  and also recuses himself from the question of whether Facebook is turning into a one company town  Local issues here are passionately and thoroughly debated   he said   This hasn t waned during the six years I ve been involved and I don t expect that it will in the future  Facebook s move toward openness and community engagement is recent  Its current campus  which it moved into in 2011  is a ring of buildings with a  street  in the middle that has restaurants  pop up shops  a book exchange and other amenities  but only employees can go there Across the street  the company opened in 2015 an office designed by Frank Gehry  It is basically one enormous room   the largest open floor plan in the world  Facebook says  On the landscaped roof is a garden  a walking loop and many trees  The neighbors cannot see any of this In Zucktown  this notion of firmly separated insiders and outsiders will be deliberately blurred  The retail stores will not be managed by Facebook  But we have the mechanism  we are the property owner   says Mr  Tenanes  the real estate chief  adding that he doesn t know exactly how it will work in practice   It is a bit new  Menlo Science   Technology Park  a decaying office park that will be torn down for Willow Village  is not exactly a beloved part of the city  and neither are the other sites on which Facebook has been building  They were in an industrial zone  That has helped insulate the company from criticism  which nonetheless simmers beneath the surface in Belle Haven The Peery Foundation  a grantmaker based nearby in Palo Alto  made a short video two years ago documenting how the area around Facebook s headquarters was changing  It interviewed dozens of local residents  including one woman who referred to landlords who had been renting to low income families and were now selling their properties   Eventually   she said   there s going to be nobody here but Facebook  Facebook  in a comment at the end of the film  acknowledges   We still have a lot of work to do   The company has increased its efforts in the community  So has the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative  a limited liability company set up by Mr  Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan for philanthropy  At the same time  Facebook has continued to expand Ms  Taylor grew up in Belle Haven  left  came back to run for the Menlo Park City Council in 2016  narrowly lost  and last year formed Belle Haven Action  It is an organization on a shoestring  she and two colleagues do not have offices and hold meetings at the local community center  Facebook is very smart   she said   They have money in every problem  Immigration  Housing  Transportation  Education   For example  the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative gave  3 million to an East Palo Alto legal services group that helps low income residents with housing and immigration issues  It has given more than  7 million to create a primary school And it is helping fund Belle Haven Action  In January  the organization got a  75 000 grant from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative Ms  Taylor acknowledged it is awkward for an advocacy

"Over the last half decade  few stocks have been more beloved by investors and Wall Street analysts than Facebook  No wonder  After a rocky initial public offering in 2012  it has rolled over one obstacle after another  including the shift to mobile computing and the rise of photo sharing  It delivered revenue and user growth that surpassed even the most optimistic projections By the end of last year  Facebook had 2 2 billion active users  Its stock rose 53 percent last year  single handedly accounting for 3 7 percent of the 21 8 percent gain in the Standard   Poor s 500 stock index  according to S  P  Dow Jones Indices  By early February  its market capitalization had surpassed  560 billion  making it the fifth most valuable company in the index By then Facebook alone accounted for nearly 2 percent of the S  P  500 index  which means that anyone who owns a broad based stock mutual fund or index fund probably owns Facebook shares  Sophisticated investors and institutions  too  have considerable exposure  Goldman Sachs analysts reported last month that Facebook was the second most widely held stock  after Amazon  by hedge funds Over 90 percent of Wall Street analysts covering the company deemed Facebook a  buy  in early February  even though  at  195 a share  its price to earnings ratio  a common valuation measure  was a lofty 35   The average ratio now is about 24  historically  it has been about 15  It was  as Wall Street pundits like to say   priced for perfection  Whatever else can be said about Facebook s recent tribulations  this much is certain  Its situation is far from perfection After revelations that data harvested from Facebook may have been used to try to influence Britain s vote to leave the European Union and the United States presidential election  the social network giant faces multiple investigations in both Europe and the United States  along with potentially profit crimping regulations and limits to its use of data  And investor retribution has been swift Since hitting its peak on Feb  2  Facebook has lost an astonishing  100 billion in market capitalization  Its stock was trading midweek at close to  153 a share  a decline of nearly 22 percent   It rebounded by about 4 5 percent Thursday and closed at  159 79  With Facebook s plunge  investor concerns have spread to other social media and internet stocks with lofty multiples  like the so called FANG stocks   Facebook  Apple and Amazon  Netflix and Google   and Twitter  They accounted for more than 10 percent of the S  P  500 at their peak  People who own an index fund need to realize how important Facebook is  and how big a role it and the FANG stocks played in the market s rise   said Howard Silverblatt  senior industry analyst for the S  P  Dow Jones Indices  who oversees statistical analysis for the S  P  500   The FANG leadership is faltering  Social media hasn t faced much regulation  and now there s a cloud hanging over those companies  In the midst of past Facebook euphoria  few saw this coming  One that did was Aiera  a robot that uses artificial intelligence to make stock recommendations  Aiera  an acronym for artificially intelligent equity research analyst  put out a  sell  recommendation for Facebook last fall So did Brian Wieser  a senior analyst at Pivotal Research Group  who covers media and internet companies  Although he was positive about the stock for most of its long climb  he downgraded Facebook to  sell  last summer based on regulatory and advertiser concerns and what he now considers  systemic management issues  Not only was it a lonely position  but  the stock went up and up   Mr  Wieser told me this week   But I thought the market was wrong  full stop   I didn t know what the catalyst would be  but at some point revenue growth had to slow and the margins go down   he said   There are practical limits  And I felt investors were looking at Facebook in much too positive a light  They just ignored all the bad things  and there were a lot of them  Then  when the news broke this month that a British firm  Cambridge Analytica  had used Facebook data for voter profiling  Mr  Wieser said  he thought it was  the most significant thing that had happened to Facebook since it became a public company   Most people hadn t given much thought to how their data is used   he added   But this really exposed the potential abuse  This is digital advertising s original sin  and there s going to be a reckoning that even now I don t think most investors fully appreciate  The other Facebook skeptic  Aiera  can talk  but Wells Fargo   whose global internet analyst  Ken Sena  developed the robot along with Bryan Healey   wasn t making its wunderkind available for interviews  But based on Aiera s published comments  it issued its sell recommendation after analyzing the frequency of negative mentions in the media of Russia s use of Facebook to influence the presidential election  as well as fundamental valuation and technical factors   Aiera uses artificial intelligence to read and analyze a half million pieces of data per day gleaned from the internet  It currently analyzes more than 1 600 stocks  Wells Fargo has stressed that Aiera remains in experimental mode  but one potential advantage is that it removes all human emotion from its analysis  Thus  Aiera was indifferent to the fact that nearly every other analyst had a buy recommendation on Facebook That included her putative master  Mr  Sena  who was thrust into the somewhat awkward position of explaining his own buy recommendation even as Aiera said sell When I spoke to him this week  Mr  Sena stressed that Aiera was a tool that could detect patterns and eliminate bias   Aiera said election interference was a big deal  and it turned out it was a big deal   Mr  Sena said   But it s not meant to supplant human judgments  He hasn t changed his buy recommendation even though he agrees with Mr  Wieser that investors need to take threats of regulation seriously   The conventional wisdom was that people don t care that much about how their data is used   Mr  Sena said   They like the convenience of targeted advertising  But the level of public outcry over this is new    Facebook is going to have to do a lot of explaining    he added   I believe they have the capability and the technology to make the platform secure  But it s going to distract from other initiatives investors are counting on for growth  like virtual reality and video content  Even so  Facebook s decline has been so steep that even Mr  Wieser and Aiera may reassess their recommendations if they calculate that the stock has bottomed out When he last reiterated his sell recommendation  Mr  Wieser s price target was  152   I don t want to be trigger happy on this   he said   It s not clear yet what happens next  I want to fine tune my thoughts before I revisit this  Aiera canceled her sell recommendation after the stock plunged  She hasn t yet made a new recommendation  Of 45 analysts who cover Facebook  41 currently have a  buy  or  overweight  recommendation  up from 39 a month ago Mr  Sena is even more bullish on Facebook than he was before  and hasn t changed his price target of  230   People are still glued to Facebook and Instagram   he said Its price to earnings ratio is now just 28  barely above the market average  which makes it  the cheapest stock in our coverage area  and it has some of the best growth prospects   he said   There s no way mathematically to justify a loss of more than  70 billion in market cap  "

"LONDON    I m 57  with a 30 year old wife  a fairly new hot water boiler  an old style television  a petrol car and no kids Actually  none of that is true  But that is what you might believe if you purchased access to my data from the world s largest information broker by market value The recent revelation that data miner Cambridge Analytica Ltd  improperly accessed 50 million Facebook users  personal data has heightened public concern about the way companies harvest and use our personal data I asked Arkansas based Acxiom Corp   which earns over  800 million a year selling consumer profiles to the world s largest companies  what data and insights it held on me In Europe and the U S   companies like Acxiom are allowed to collect data from public and other sources about us  European privacy rules  which are due to be strengthened in coming months  require all data gatherers to disclose to any European who asks what information they hold on them  U S  law doesn t give Americans the right to this level of disclosure The result of my inquiry shows how  even with little raw data  companies attempt to build detailed pictures of individuals  finances  relationships  personal interests and purchasing tastes These profiles now power the elaborate machinery that delivers advertising across the internet  and can also be used to determine what political issues people are interested in and how they might vote The question is  How accurate are the pictures they sketch  AFFLUENT FUN SEEKER Acxiom   like its rivals   operates by gathering publicly available information from sources like the electoral roll  which gives individuals  addresses  and land registry data  which provides details on home ownership such as purchase price and if there is a mortgage on the property It also buys data from companies that conduct online surveys  as well as websites where you forgot to tick  don t share with third parties  and other sources  This data is then put into a proprietary model  which produces a list of data points and propensities  such as the likelihood a consumer might visit a betting shop Acxiom sells access to these profiles to companies that wish to target advertising at potential customers  Acxiom doesn t have a political arm like Cambridge Analytica does  but the two companies do compete for commercial customers Facebook  in the wake of the scandal over how it handles personal information  said on Wednesday it would end its partnerships with several large data brokers who help advertisers target people on the social network  Shares in Acxiom traded down more than 10 percent to  25 following Facebook s announcement The results for a single individual obviously don t tell us too much about the accuracy of a database that Acxiom says contains 47 million UK profiles and insights into 700 million consumers worldwide Also  it seems I am a bad data subject since I usually opt out when asked to give companies data sharing rights  Where we have more self reported  privacy compliant data about individuals  we can be more accurate  In your case  we held very little of this data and the majority of the variables linked to you  are modelled  based on both your postcode and the household history   Acxiom said in a statement My Acxiom profile has around 750 individual data fields under a dozen categories from  household composition  to  employment   income  and  lifestyle   interests   It categorizes me as an  affluent fun seeker    The accuracy of that description depends on your definition  I suppose  but some of the information is plain wrong To start with  I m 46 years old  not 57  I won t reveal my wife s age  but I will confirm that when I got married at age 34  it wasn t to a teenager  Two children mean we re not  empty nesters   I drive a diesel car and our boiler is more than 15 years old  not less than five years as Acxiom identifies it as That could be a disappointment for the companies including Tesco supermarket  Twitter  Ford Motor Company and Facebook to whom Acxiom said it may have provided my data in the past year  Or maybe not PROFILE ERRORSThe fact that my profile contains errors isn t necessarily a problem for marketers said Carol Hargreaves  a professor and director of the Data Analytics Consulting Center at the National University of Singapore What really matters is the predictions of one s behavior  interests and propensity to buy certain kinds of products  The things you sell to a male of 46 or a male of 57 are the same   Hargreaves said In some potentially key areas  the data is certainly better than a random guess  It predicted that I had just a 5 2 percent probability of being self employed  rather than employed  Official data shows around 17 percent of Britons are self employed Acxiom s prediction of my household income was also much closer to the actual number than the average published by the Greater London Authority for my electoral ward  or local electoral district  the narrowest official estimate But if purchase decisions are driven by lifestyle interests  the data collected on me is of little use to marketers My predicted annual car mileage was 8 000 to 10 000 miles  based on  modelled probability   This figure echoes the 8 405 miles that car breakdown group the RAC says the average London motorist drives each year  But it s over twice my annual mileage Acxiom incorrectly says I don t have a flat screen television  something it  derived through modeling   even though a UK government report from 2013 says most households do One in seven Britons is a member of a gym  according to a 2017 industry survey  Acxiom reckons there s a 47 5 percent chance that I am interested in belonging to a gym  My last subscription expired over a decade ago Acxiom also thinks I am more likely to be interested in crossword puzzles   I haven t done one since the 1980s   than in current affairs  which has been my working life for 20 years On the positive side  there are indications Acxiom doesn t engage in racial profiling  The company predicts I have a 13 6 percent probability of interest in regularly going to a bar  I asked Hargreaves  the professor  if this seemed a statistically reasonable estimate for an Irish journalist  After she stopped laughing  Hargreaves said accurate predictions hinged on the raw data on which the profile is based BAND WAGONAcxiom said individual inaccuracies didn t undermine the value of its service  We know from working with leading brands  that data helps them deliver more accurate and relevant marketing to customers at scale    The key factor here is   at scale    it said in a statement Annabel Kilner  Chief Commercial Officer at furniture retailer MADE com said consumer data helped firms deliver messages that consumers found relevant  We adopt a test and learn approach to optimizing our campaigns   Kilner said Xiaojing Dong  associate professor of marketing and business analytics at Santa Clara University in Silicon Valley  said that qualitative predictions like those produced by Acxiom gave advertisers a much better idea of who they are reaching But Hargreaves said there was concern among some advertisers that the consumer profiles they purchase from data aggregators may not always be worth the large fees involved  Hargreaves said she is about to start working with clients of companies like Acxiom to ascertain whether they were getting value for money  Some of the data vendors are just jumping on the band wagon   she said The key to accurate profiling  experts said  was good raw data  The best is held by those companies with whom we have the deepest interactions   social media giants like Facebook or Twitter and retailers like Amazon com Stephan Lewandowsky  a professor of cognitive psychology at the University of Bristol in Britain  said that explains why companies like Cambridge Analytica would be so eager to access Facebook data  The difference between using the electoral roll and Facebook is that the information we reveal on Facebook is sufficient for a computer program to infer our personality with greater accuracy than our own spouse   he

"SAN FRANCISCO   Facebook employees were in an uproar on Friday over a leaked 2016 memo from a top executive defending the social network s growth at any cost   even if it caused deaths from a terrorist attack that was organized on the platform In the memo  Andrew Bosworth  a Facebook vice president  wrote   Maybe someone dies in a terrorist attack coordinated on our tools  And still we connect people  The ugly truth is that we believe in connecting people so deeply that anything that allows us to connect more people more often is  de facto  good  Mr  Bosworth and Facebook s chief executive  Mark Zuckerberg  have since disavowed the memo  which was published on Thursday by BuzzFeed News But the fallout at the Silicon Valley company has been wide  According to two Facebook employees  workers have been calling on internal message boards for a hunt to find those who leak to the media  Some have questioned whether Facebook has been transparent enough with its users and with journalists  said the employees  who asked not to be identified for fear of retaliation  Many are also concerned over what might leak next and are deleting old comments or messages that might come across as controversial or newsworthy  they said The brouhaha follows a period of intense scrutiny for Facebook and questions over what its responsibilities are to its more than 2 2 billion users  The company has been grappling this month with revelations that a British political consulting firm  Cambridge Analytica  improperly harvested data from 50 million of the social network s users  Mr  Zuckerberg has since been on an apology tour over data privacy and is expected to testify before lawmakers in Washington Facebook did not respond to a request for comment over employees  reaction to the leaked memo In the aftermath  some Facebook executives have taken to Twitter for a public charm offensive  sending pithy phrases and emoticons to reporters who cover the company  Adam Mosseri  Facebook s head of news feed  in recent days wrote unprompted to a BuzzFeed editor and to its chief executive reminiscing and telling a story about his mother  He also wrote to a reporter from the Verge tech site about the songs played at his wedding reception In some of his tweets  Mr  Mosseri also defended Facebook  When writers from Vox and BuzzFeed tweeted that they noticed that stories critical of Facebook were receiving surprisingly low levels of traffic on Facebook  Mr  Mosseri jumped in  We 100  do not take any action on stories for being critical of us   he tweeted Mr  Bosworth  the author of the 2016 memo  also took to Twitter  Late Thursday  he said he did not agree with what he wrote in the memo  and I didn t agree with it even when I wrote it   He added that  the purpose of this post  like many others I have written internally  was to bring to the surface issues I felt deserved more discussion with the broader company  After BuzzFeed published the memo  Mr  Bosworth deleted it from an internal message board where it had originally been posted  In a statement to BuzzFeed  Mr  Zuckerberg praised Mr  Bosworth as  a talented leader who says many provocative things  and said that he and most people at Facebook did not agree with the memo and that the company had realized that it could not just be about connecting people Facebook employees said on Friday that discussions were raging across the company regarding the merits of the post  Some called for executives to aggressively pursue action against those leaking to the media  said two Facebook employees  as well as for the company to do more to screen for potential whistle blowers during the hiring process At least one former Facebook employee  Alec Muffett  wrote on Twitter that Mr  Bosworth s memo was responsible for his decision to leave the company  Between overwork and leadership direction evidenced thusly  I could never stay   wrote Mr  Muffett  who formerly worked as a Facebook engineer  There are some amazing engineers working at Facebook  folks who care deeply about user privacy  security  and how people will use the code that they write   Mr  Muffett said later in a message   Alas this episode may not help  to achieve more transparent internal product discussion  he said "
"Eric H  Holder Jr   the United States attorney general for six years under President Barack Obama  stepped away from public service in 2015 but has since emerged as a bulwark against the Trump administration  taking a leading role in challenging the president s policies in court and trying to chip away at the Republicans  grip on state governments  Mr  Holder discussed his efforts to fight Republican gerrymandering  whether Facebook should be regulated and the potential legacy of Mr  Trump s presidency in a wide ranging TimesTalks conversation with the reporter Alexander Burns on Wednesday night in New York Here are the takeaways After the Trump administration announced this week that it would add a question about citizenship to the 2020 census  Mr  Holder said he planned to sue to block the change on behalf of the National Democratic Redistricting Committee  which he chairs  The census aims to count everyone who resides in the country  whether they are citizens or not  and Mr  Holder echoed the concerns expressed by several states this week that the citizenship question could reduce the responses from noncitizens and even legal immigrants He said his lawsuit would be aided by Mr  Trump s Twitter utterances  This is one of those incidences where I think the president s tweets and public statements will become relevant   Mr  Holder  67  said   To show the true intent   that it is not as benign as they would make it out to be  Through the words of Donald Trump and through the tweets of Donald Trump  you ll see what the true intention was of the administration  Normally  he noted  it would be difficult to argue in court that the government pushed a policy with a malicious intent  But Mr  Trump s tweets provide plenty of material for lawsuits  Mr  Holder said  It is certainly the gift that keeps on giving   he said Mr  Holder conceded that he prefers Twitter to Facebook but occasionally catches a glimpse of Facebook when his wife signs on  But he said he had been following the recent news that a British political consulting firm  Cambridge Analytica  improperly harvested the information of 50 million Facebook users That security breach  along with the social network s role in spreading Russian backed propaganda during the presidential election  bolstered an argument for regulating Facebook  Mr  Holder said  There needs to be a certain degree of freedom   he said   We don t want to stifle the creativity that comes from those platforms  But he added   There is a way in which we have to think of these platforms as communication companies  What then does that mean in terms of how they should be regulated  Mr  Holder  who served as the attorney general from February 2009 to April 2015  said he was stunned by the support Mr  Trump still enjoyed in some circles after a pornographic film star and a former Playboy model claimed they had sexual relationships with him  I find it hard to believe the conversations that we have about the conduct of this president  They are mind blowing   he said   I think to myself  You gave my guy grief because he wore a tan suit  Mr  Holder said that if the same allegations of extramarital affairs had been made against Mr  Obama or President George W  Bush  their presidencies would have been over   I just don t understand how this has not had the reaction generated that would have been generated by any other president   he said Mr  Trump has nominated Mike Pompeo  the director of the C I A   to be the next secretary of state and named a veteran of the spy agency  Gina Haspel  as the next director  Both nominations require Senate confirmation  and Ms  Haspel will certainly face questions about her work as a clandestine officer in the agency s counterterrorism operations  She oversaw a secret prison in Thailand involved in the rendition  detention and interrogation of detainees In 2012  Mr  Holder effectively closed that dark chapter in the C I A  s history  announcing that a three year Justice Department investigation into brutal interrogations was ending without a prosecution  The decision outraged some liberals On Wednesday night  Mr  Holder said that Ms  Haspel would have to answer tough questions   and that the public deserved to know more about the country s enhanced interrogation program  He said that parts of the Justice Department report and a separate Senate investigation into the program should be declassified  The American people need to know exactly what happened during that time period   he said Responding to recent calls for a repeal of the Second Amendment  Mr  Holder said such an effort was impracticable but offered four suggestions to address what he called a  gun violence epidemic in the United States   His remarks came days after John Paul Stevens  a retired associate justice of the United States Supreme Court  wrote an Op Ed in The Times advocating repeal Assault weapons should be banned  as well as higher capacity magazines  Mr  Holder said  Background checks should be expanded for prospective gun buyers  and the government should reinstate the funding of studies on gun violence by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  Compare us to any other nation  and we are just off the charts when it comes to mass shootings and the number of people killed through the use of firearms   Mr  Holder said   We have to do something about it  "
"SAN FRANCISCO   Two days after Donald J  Trump won the 2016 election  executives at Google consoled their employees in an all staff meeting broadcast around the world  There is a lot of fear within Google   said Sundar Pichai  the company s chief executive  according to a video of the meeting viewed by The New York Times  When asked by an employee if there was any silver lining to Mr  Trump s election  the Google co founder Sergey Brin said   Boy  that s a really tough one right now   Ruth Porat  the finance chief  said Mr  Trump s victory felt  like a ton of bricks dropped on my chest   Then she instructed members of the audience to hug the person next to them Sixteen months later  Google s parent company  Alphabet  has most likely saved billions of dollars in taxes on its overseas cash under a new tax law signed by Mr  Trump  Alphabet also stands to benefit from the Trump administration s looser regulations for self driving cars and delivery drones  as well as from proposed changes to the trade pact with Mexico and Canada that would limit Google s liability for user content on its sites Once one of Mr  Trump s most vocal opponents  Silicon Valley s technology industry has increasingly found common ground with the White House  When Mr  Trump was elected  tech executives were largely up in arms over a leader who espoused policies on immigration and other issues that were antithetical to their companies  values  Now  many of the industry s executives are growing more comfortable with the president and how his economic agenda furthers their business interests  even as many of their employees continue to disagree with Mr  Trump on social issues The relationship remains bumpy  Mr  Trump lashed out at Amazon on Twitter on Thursday  accusing the e commerce giant of evading taxes   Amazon said it had saved  789 million under the tax law Mr  Trump signed   The president is also expected to sign legislation   passed by the Senate last week  that would strengthen policing of sex trafficking online   a bill that internet companies once opposed because they worried it would make them liable for content posted by their users Yet quietly  the tech industry has warmed to the White House  especially as companies including Alphabet  Apple and Intel have benefited from the Trump administration s policies Those include lowering corporate taxes  encouraging development of new wireless technology like 5G and  so far  ignoring calls to break up the tech giants  Mr  Trump s tougher stance on China may also help ward off industry rivals  with the president squashing a hostile bid to acquire the chip maker Qualcomm this month  And Mr  Trump let die an Obama era rule that required many tech start ups to give some workers more overtime pay Mr  Trump  has been great for business and really  really good for tech   said Gary Shapiro  who leads the Consumer Technology Association  the largest American tech trade group  with more than 2 200 members including Apple  Google  Amazon and Facebook Mr  Shapiro said that he had voted for Hillary Clinton  Mr  Trump s opponent  in 2016  but that he and many tech executives had come around on Mr  Trump  While they disagree with him on immigration and the environment  they have found areas where their interests align  like deregulation and investment in internet infrastructure  This isn t Hitler or Mussolini here   Mr  Shapiro said  And even though the president s new tariffs on steel and aluminum could hurt American businesses and consumers   disagreement in one area does not mean we cannot work together in others   Mr  Shapiro said   Everyone who is married knows that  Mr  Trump himself has taken to naming tech companies he says are on his side After Apple took advantage of the new tax law in January to bring back most of the  252 billion cash hoard that it had parked overseas  the company said it would make a  350 billion  contribution to the U S  economy  over the next five years  That prompted Mr  Trump to suggest he had made good on a campaign pledge to get Apple to bring jobs back to the United States  You know  for  350 million  you could build a beautiful plant  But for  350 billion  they re going to build a lot of plants   the president told members of Congress last month  Mr  Trump said he had called Timothy D  Cook  Apple s chief executive  to personally thank him In fact  Apple has no plans to build a plant in the United States  The company is uneasy with Mr  Trump s invoking it to signify how his policies are working  according to a person close to Apple who was not authorized to speak publicly  Apple has not  however  publicly corrected the president Mr  Trump has also stayed quiet on the controversy engulfing Facebook over user privacy  while other politicians have called for more regulations after revelations that the British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica improperly harvested the information of 50 million Facebook users  Cambridge Analytica used that data to aid Mr  Trump s campaign Michael Kratsios  the White House s deputy chief technology officer  said in an interview that while Mr  Trump and Silicon Valley had their differences   in places where we do see eye to eye  I think we re achieving extraordinary success  Dean Garfield  head of the Information Technology Industry Council  a 102 year old advocacy group that represents the biggest tech firms  said his members walked a tightrope  supporting and opposing the president on different issues  Lately  he said   we have reached balance in the tightrope  The equilibrium marks a turnabout from what had been a testy relationship between Mr  Trump and the tech sector  On the campaign trail in 2016  Mr  Trump was so critical of tech companies that Jeff Bezos  Amazon s chief executive  once joked he might send Mr  Trump to space in a rocket Some tech executives have since disagreed with Mr  Trump on social issues  Mr  Cook emailed staff last June to say he had unsuccessfully lobbied the president to remain in the Paris climate accords  In November  Microsoft sued the administration to protect a law that blocks deportation of young undocumented immigrants known as Dreamers  More than 100 companies  including Google  Facebook and Uber  filed a brief supporting California s lawsuit on that issue Even so  tech executives worked to build a relationship with the president  with some meeting him at Trump Tower before his inauguration and again at the White House in June  While in Washington for the second meeting  Mr  Cook and Satya Nadella  Microsoft s chief executive  also dined with Jared Kushner  the president s senior adviser and son in law  and Ivanka Trump at the couple s Washington home  according to a person briefed on the meeting who wasn t authorized to speak publicly about it  This month  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin visited Apple s headquarters Silicon Valley has found plenty to like about the Trump presidency  In September  tech giants including Facebook and Microsoft teamed up with the administration to pledge  500 million to computer science education  Amazon  Microsoft and Google are also eyeing the administration as a potential customer as Mr  Trump pushes to modernize the government s digital infrastructure But Silicon Valley s favorite thing about Mr  Trump is almost certainly his new tax code  Many tech companies lobbied for corporate tax reform for years before Mr  Trump signed the new tax bill Tech giants immediately reaped the benefits  Under the new rules  Apple saved  43 7 billion in taxes  according to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy  a nonpartisan research group  Apple then announced the  350 billion  contribution  to the economy over five years Most of the tally was previously planned spending with American suppliers and a  38 billion tax payment on its overseas cash  But Apple also said it planned to hire 20 000 new workers  invest in new data centers and another domestic campus  and increase a fund for innovative American manufacturers to  5 billion from  1 billion  It also gave employees  2 500 bonuses The president was quick to tweet the news The shifting relationship between Silicon Valley and Mr  Trump appears to have upset some tech employees  A Facebook page called  Angry Googler   with nearly 1 000 followers  has been dedicated to criticizing Google for any sign it was cooperating with the president  Not happy about Google pulling a 180 and jumping into bed with Trump  Same here   said the  About  section of the page  which suggests it is run by a Google employee  This month  the page posted an article about Google helping the Defense Department analyze drone footage   We ve gone from organizing the world s information to   optimizing weapons of war   the page said Messages to the account were not returned  Google declined to comment Some tech firms remain discomfited about appearing as the president s allies  Last month  Rob Goldman  Facebook s vice president of advertising  played down Russia s impact on the 2016 election after the Justice Department charged 13 Russians with trying to subvert its outcome  including by using Facebook  Mr  Trump retweeted Mr  Goldman approvingly Facebook was uncomfortable with that association with the president  said a person close to the company who was not authorized to speak publicly Two days later  Facebook s policy chief  Joel Kaplan  distanced the company from Mr  Goldman s comments  The special counsel has issued its indictments  and nothing we found contradicts their conclusions   he said in a statement   Any suggestion otherwise is wrong  "
"SAN FRANCISCO   The contemporary internet was built on a bargain  Show us who you really are and the digital world will be free to search or share People detailed their interests and obsessions on Facebook and Google  generating a river of data that could be collected and harnessed for advertising  The companies became very rich  Users seemed happy  Privacy was deemed obsolete  like bloodletting and milkmen Now  the consumer surveillance model underlying Facebook and Google s free services is under siege from users  regulators and legislators on both sides of the Atlantic  It amounts to a crisis for an internet industry that up until now had taken a reactive  whack a mole approach to problems like the spread of fraudulent news and misuse of personal data The recent revelation that Cambridge Analytica  a voter profiling company that had worked with Donald J  Trump s presidential campaign  harvested data from 50 million Facebook users  raised the current uproar  even if the origins lie as far back as the 2016 election  It has been many months of allegations and arguments that the internet in general and social media in particular are pulling society down instead of lifting it up That has inspired a good deal of debate about more restrictive futures for Facebook and Google  At the furthest extreme  some dream of the companies becoming public utilities  More benign business models that depend less on ads and more on subscriptions have been proposed  although it s unclear why either company would abandon something that has made them so prosperous Congress might pass targeted legislation to restrict consumer data use in specific sectors  such as a Senate bill that would require increased transparency in online political advertising  said Daniel J  Weitzner  director of the Internet Policy Research Initiative at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology There are other avenues still  said Jascha Kaykas Wolff  the chief marketing officer of Mozilla  the nonprofit organization behind the popular Firefox browser  including advertisers and large tech platforms collecting vastly less user data and still effectively customizing ads to consumers  They are just collecting all the data to try to find magic growth algorithms   Mr  Kaykas Wolff said of online marketers  This past week  Mozilla halted its ads on Facebook  saying the social network s default privacy settings allowed access to too much data The greatest likelihood is that the internet companies  frightened by the tumult  will accept a few more rules and work a little harder for transparency  And there will be hearings on Capitol Hill The next chapter is also set to play out not in Washington but in Europe  where regulators have already cracked down on privacy violations and are examining the role of data in online advertising The Cambridge Analytica case  said Vera Jourova  the European Union commissioner for justice  consumers and gender equality  was not just a breach of private data   This is much more serious  because here we witness the threat to democracy  to democratic plurality   she said Although many people had a general understanding that free online services used their personal details to customize the ads they saw  the latest controversy starkly exposed the machinery Consumers  seemingly benign activities   their likes   could be used to covertly categorize and influence their behavior  And not just by unknown third parties  Facebook itself has worked directly with presidential campaigns on ad targeting  describing its services in a company case study as  influencing voters   People are upset that their data may have been used to secretly influence 2016 voters   said Alessandro Acquisti  a professor of information technology and public policy at Carnegie Mellon University   If your personal information can help sway elections  which affects everyone s life and societal well being  maybe privacy does matter after all  In interviews  Mr  Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg  Facebook s chief operating officer  seemed to accept the possibility of increased privacy regulation  something that would have been unlikely only a few months ago  But some trade group executives also warned that any attempt to curb the use of consumer data would put the business model of the ad supported internet at risk  You re undermining a fundamental concept in advertising  reaching consumers who are interested in a particular product   said Dean C  Garfield  chief executive of the Information Technology Industry Council  a trade group in Washington whose members include Amazon  Facebook  Google and Twitter If suspicion of Facebook and Google is a relatively new feeling in the United States  it has been embedded in Europe for historical and cultural reasons that date back to the Nazi Gestapo  the Soviet occupation of Eastern Europe and the Cold War  We re at an inflection point  when the great wave of optimism about tech is giving way to growing alarm   said Heather Grabbe  director of the Open Society European Policy Institute   This is the moment when Europeans turn to the state for protection and answers  and are less likely than Americans to rely on the market to sort out imbalances  In May  the European Union is instituting a comprehensive new privacy law  called the General Data Protection Regulation  The new rules treat personal data as proprietary  owned by an individual  and any use of that data must be accompanied by permission   opting in rather than opting out   after receiving a request written in clear language  not legalese Mélanie Voin  a spokeswoman for the European Commission  said the protection rules will have more teeth than the current 1995 directive  For example  a company experiencing a data breach involving individuals must notify the data protection authority within 72 hours and would be subject to fines of up to 20 million euros or 4 percent of its annual revenue In a January speech in Brussels  Facebook s Ms  Sandberg said   We know we can t just meet the G D P R   but we need to do even more   Google declined to comment The United States does not have a consumer privacy law like the General Data Protection Regulation  But after years of pushing for similar legislation  privacy groups said that recent events were giving them new momentum   and they were looking to Europe for inspiration  With the new European law  regulators for the first time have real enforcement tools   said Jeffrey Chester  the executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy  a nonprofit group in Washington   We now have a way to hold these companies accountable  But any ambitions for new rules may run into the realities of the tech industry Privacy advocates and even some United States regulators have long been concerned about the ability of online services to track consumers and make inferences about their financial status  health concerns and other intimate details to show them behavior based ads  They warned that such microtargeting could unfairly categorize or exclude certain people In 2010  for instance  the Federal Trade Commission proposed a new option for consumers  called Do Not Track  Two years later  the Barack Obama administration introduced a blueprint for a Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights  intended to give Americans more control over what personal details companies collected from them and how the data was used But the Do Not Track effort and the privacy bill were both stymied Industry groups successfully argued that collecting personal details posed no harm to consumers and that efforts to hinder data collection would chill innovation  Instead  the advertising industry created a program to allow consumers to opt out of having their data used for customized ads  although it does not allow people to entirely opt out of having their data collected  If it can be shown that the current situation is actually a market failure and not an individual company failure  then there s a case to be made for federal regulation  under certain circumstances  said Randall Rothenberg  chief executive of the Interactive Advertising Bureau  a trade group The business practices of Facebook and Google were reinforced by the fact that no privacy flap lasted longer than a news cycle or two  Nor did people flee for other services  That convinced the companies that digital privacy was a dead issue If the current furor dies down without meaningful change  critics worry that the problems might become even more entrenched  When the tech industry follows its natural impulses  it becomes even less transparent That would hamper any long term understanding of the relationship between social media and political views  an urgent question in Germany  Myanmar  Sri Lanka  the United States and many other places  To know the real interaction between populism and Facebook  you need to give much more access to researchers  not less   said Paul Jasper Dittrich  a German research fellow in digital economy at the Jacques Delors Institute There s another reason Silicon Valley tends to be reluctant to share information about what it is doing  It believes so deeply in itself that it does not even think there is a need for discussion  The technology world s remedy for any problem is always more technology  If Facebook and Google were merely interested in maximizing profits  we could regulate them   said Maciej Ceglowski  who runs Tech Solidarity  a labor advocacy group   But well intentioned people can break things not easy to fix  It s like a child running a bulldozer  They don t have any sense of the damage they can do  "

which the queens cobbled together an impressive array of looks and hit the runway Before the judging  Ru announced that another queen would be returning   No  it wasn t Shangela  She s walking in the woods   The competitors visibly blanched as Ru introduced the Season 9 contestant Farrah Moan   who was quickly Ru vealed to actually be Farrah s doppelgänger  the guest judge Christina Aguilera  Ms  Aguilera did a quick bit that reminded us why  Burlesque  was her last notable acting job  then pulled out a hand held mic from seemingly nowhere and did a quick melismatic run  The queens swooned Mayhem  who crafted a cigarette girl ensemble out of latex gloves and trash bags  leaked tears when she was named the winner of the challenge  The judge and national treasure Ross Mathews soothed and encouraged her by saying   This is your time   I paid my therapist  200 an hour to tell me that when my husband left me  so  Mayhem  consider that money in your bank  Invest in Cambridge Analytica The bottom two were Kalorie  correctly called on the carpet for her  million dollar dress  of generic Monopoly money hot glued to an ill fitting bustier  a fourth removed cousin of superior cash fronted gowns of queens past   and Vanessa  spatchcocked by Michelle Visage for her definition deficient  doll festooned silk flower leotard    It s literally a head and legs  and the rest is flowers   Michelle hissed  somehow turning into an insult the exact phrase I ve always dreamed a man would use to describe my body   They were ordered to lip sync for their lives to Ms  Aguilera s  Ain t No Other Man  Kalorie described herself as  the twerking queen   and she is not wrong  In a coup de grâce  she pulled a fistful of dollar bills from her bustier and made it rain on herself Vanessa s lip sync was a bit wan in comparison  and she was  sadly  the first bat to be plucked from the renovated cave  She bravely fought back tears as she sashayed away   I hope this isn t the last we see of her Ru declared at the top of the episode that the mission of  Drag Race  is to take over the world  and 10 years in  his coup seems to be just about complete  The show s stars have millions of fans and fill performance halls in red states  with teenage girls cosplaying as their favorite queens  RuPaul has built a juggernaut on the wigs of queens old enough not just to be this season s drag mothers  but their birth mothers But with great power comes great Ru sponsibility  Drag is currently a cultural Bitcoin  and it seems that in its peaking moment  it will either permanently tuck itself into the mainstream or pop back into the bubbles  Heavy will be the head that eventually wears this season s crown  But this crop of girls seems especially fun and smart  with good wigs on their padded shoulders  and I trust that one of them will responsibly lead us to the midterms  I look forward to spending my spring in their company Will Eureka make it through this season on both feet  Will The Vixen collude with a group of Russian drag queens and take the crown in an upset  Will a remake of  Burlesque  starring Farrah Moan and Cher alike All Star Chad Michaels finally be greenlit See you next week "
"Good Thursday  Here s what we re watching   Why Trump might have trouble reining in Amazon   Public pension fund wants changes to Facebook s board   Trump tweets Amazon does not pay enough taxes   Another FANG stock took a tumble   The Trump administration wants to further thwart sensitive Chinese investments The DealBook newsletter is taking a break for Good Friday  We ll be back with you on Monday  Sign up for it here Amazon hasn t responded to President Trump s latest tweet about the company  and most likely won t Mr  Trump s criticisms  though  are largely mistaken  For a long time  Amazon did not pay state sales tax  but it does so now when it sells its own goods in states that collect it  It is the case  however  that in most states Amazon does not collect sales taxes on goods sold by third parties through its platform  As for the United States Postal Service  Amazon s business appears to be giving a welcome lift to its package shipping revenue Still  Amazon cannot quietly hope that such criticism just fades away  Amazon s rapid growth  immense bargaining power  eye catching initiatives and estimated 44 percent share of U S  e commerce sales make the company vulnerable to accusations that it is too powerful But if the Trump administration pursues ways to curtail the company  it would meet sizable obstacles Amazon accounts for only 4 percent of all retail sales in the United States  a recent survey estimated  Its revenue is a third of Walmart s and  even after its acquisition of Whole Foods  Amazon s footing in the grocery business is still small All in all  it would be hard to show that Amazon is pushing prices higher for consumers Amazon also has a loyal customer base   it has an estimated 90 million Prime members   and the public views it relatively favorably  When the Department of Justice s antitrust lawyers went after the proposed merger of Time Warner and AT T  it was not targeting companies that were particularly popular with the public Still  some Amazon critics see a possible  though small  opening  In theory  an antitrust case could focus on the firms that supply Amazon with goods  according to Christopher L  Sagers  a law professor at Cleveland State University  If a company consistently uses its power to demand a good from suppliers at too low a price  the public could still get hurt  That s because the supply of the good could decline  its quality degrade  and there may be less innovation in the sector that produces the good  Mr  Sagers said But anyone bringing that against Amazon would have to explain why Walmart would not be a target  too   Peter EavisThe investment adviser to New York City s pension funds is calling for changes to Facebook s board to address the fallout from Cambridge Analytica s improper harvesting of information from 50 million users of the social network New York City s comptroller  Scott M  Stringer  wrote in a letter addressed to Dr  Susan Desmond Hellmann  an independent director at Facebook and the chief executive of the Bill   Melinda Gates Foundation New York City s pension funds  which have more than  193 billion in assets under management  own  895 million of Facebook s shares  according to the letter  Even with the recent tumble in its shares  Facebook is valued at more than  450 billion In his letter  Mr  Stringer calls on Facebook s independent directors to take four steps to help restore investor confidence Here are the proposed changes 1  Add at least three new independent directors to improve the board s ability to oversee the evolving risks Facebook faces 2  Name an independent director as chairman  allowing Mark Zuckerberg  Facebook s chief executive and chairman  to focus on running the company 3  Create a committee of independent directors to oversee the company s data privacy policies and risks 4  Institute a clawback policy so that the board can  recoup executive pay in the event of violations of law  regulation or company policy  President Trump spoke out against Amazon on Thursday  saying that the online behemoth does not pay enough taxes and uses the United States postal system  as their Delivery Boy  The president s commentary  made in a Twitter post  comes amid reports that Mr  Trump has expressed an interest in reining in the e commerce business Amazon and the company s founder  Jeff Bezos  are among Mr  Trump s regular Twitter targets  In December  Mr  Trump questioned whether the United States Post Office charges Amazon enough for package deliveries  And in August  Mr  Trump said Amazon hurts taxpaying businesses Amazon  however  does pay taxes    412 million in 2016  for instance  according to the company s report to the Securities and Exchange Commission Axios reported on Wednesday that Mr  Trump has wondered aloud whether Amazon could be vulnerable to antitrust or competition laws Amazon shares fell more than 7 percent following that Axios article but recovered some of those losses after a White House official told Reuters that the company faced no particular policy changes  But the administration is always looking at its options  the official added  The stock closed down 4 4 percent Wednesday Shares were down nearly 2 percent in early trading Should shareholders worry  The GBH Insights analyst Daniel Ives told Bloomberg that this regulatory threat was unlikely to change Amazon s business model  but it was still  the last thing nervous tech investors wanted to see today  Retailers  at least  already have some reason to be cheerful And Amazon has another target market for expansion  housekeeping Corporate American will start reporting first quarter results in less than two weeks  and earnings are expected to be big Analysts estimate that profits at companies in the S  P  500 grew 17 3 percent this quarter  according to FactSet  If the forecasts prove accurate that would be highest earnings growth rate since the first quarter of 2011 Perhaps most surprising  is that analysts have grown more optimistic on corporate earnings as the quarter progressed  The earnings forecast for the index rose 5 4 percent from the start of the quarter to the end  Typically  analysts lower their expectations as the quarter progresses  On average  the profit estimates for the index fall 3 7 percent from the start of the quarter to the end But there are reasons for investors to temper their enthusiasm  Analysts have not been as optimistic about the abilities of companies to increase sales  Revenue is expected to have grown 7 3 percent in the first quarter  up from a 7 percent rate at the start of the quarter That suggests analysts are not raising estimates because of increased sales  So why are they  Taxes  And the impact tax reform will have on bottom lines should moderate in the coming quarters That may already be happening  BofA Merrill Lynch s earnings revision ratio for the S  P  500 fell in March for the first time in three months  Of course  the pullback comes after the ratio hits the highest level on record in February  but it does suggest that earnings lift from tax reform has begun to wane Investors  always willing to believe in technology companies  spent the last three years piling into their shares with abandon  Now the intellectual underpinnings of that rally are being tested Exhibit A  Facebook  down 20 percent from its recent high Exhibit B  Nvidia  off 12 percent from its recent high Exhibit C  Tesla  not a tech stock but in the FANG  index Concerns about Tesla s ability to fund itself can also be seen in the trading of its debt The WSJ s Charley Grant explains Peter Eavis notes that the latest problems for tech giants have raised deeper doubts Barclays said on Thursday that it agreed to pay  2 billion to settle a lawsuit by United States authorities that accused the British bank of fraudulently misleading the public in the sale of tens of billions of dollars in securities backed by home mortgages The Justice Department sued the bank in December 2016 after the two sides failed to reach a settlement despite months of talks  The settlement is the latest by a European lender related to residential mortgage backed securities sold ahead of the financial crisis and follows agreements reached by Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank in late 2016  I am pleased that we have been able to reach a fair and proportionate settlement with the Department of Justice   James E  Staley  the Barclays chief executive  said in a news release   It has been a priority for this management team from the start to resolve these historic issues in a timely and appropriate manner wherever possible  Two former Barclays executives who were sued along with the bank also have reached settlements  agreeing to pay a combined  2 million  the Justice Department said in a news release Their lawyers separately said the government s claims were baseless and each agreed to settle the case without admitting wrongdoing

"BEVERLY HILLS  Calif    Barry Diller knows your weaknesses He knows how to intimidate you  if he wants to  or charm you  if he chooses  Because he is a taskmaster and a visionary and a billionaire  people in Hollywood and Silicon Valley pay close attention when he speaks He has so many vests from Herb Allen s Sun Valley retreats for global elites that they re taking over his closets  There is so much fleece   says the chairman of IAC  laughing   I ve been going for 30 years  On this rainy afternoon  by the fireplace in the Frank Lloyd Wright inspired stone and wood living room of his dreamy mansion  Mr  Diller is all charm  with a healthy dose of self deprecation  He s dressed in a red checked flannel shirt  a burgundy Hermès hoodie  baggy jeans and black Tod s loafers We are eating cold salads and drinking hot tea  served by the butler  Victor  And we are hopscotching topics  from Silicon Valley taking over Hollywood to Jared   Ivanka   Josh   Karlie to pornography to his company s dating websites to the time Harvey Weinstein tried to throw Mr  Diller off a balcony in Cannes to how his friend Hillary Clinton is faring to the mogul s dismissal of Donald Trump  whose Secret Service code name is Mogul  as  a joke  and  evil  I tell him that a friend of mine  an executive in network television  fretfully asked her Hollywood psychic how long Mr  Trump would last as president and the psychic asserted that it wouldn t be more than two years and that the president would be felled by a three page email   The only problem with this prediction being  I don t think Mr  Trump emails   I would so love it if he were being blackmailed by Putin   Mr  Diller says with a sly smile   That would make me very happy  This was a man of bad character from the moment he entered adulthood  if not before  Pure  bad character  Ugh  Trump  He shrugs off what he calls Trump s  normal  vicious Twitter attacks  on him  After Mr  Diller mocked Trump s campaign in 2015  Trump tweeted   Little Barry Diller  who lost a fortune on Newsweek and Daily Beast  only writes badly about me  He is a sad and pathetic figure  Lives lie  Mr  Diller waves off talk of Mr  Trump opening the door to more celebrity presidents  saying   I want this to be a moment in time where you go in and pick out this period with pincers and go on with life as we knew it before  Has the media gone overboard in criticizing Mr  Trump  Are you kidding   he replies Mr  Diller says that he and his wife  Diane von Furstenberg  are friends with Josh Kushner and his supermodel girlfriend  Karlie Kloss  but do not hang out with Jared and Ivanka He has put Chelsea Clinton on the boards of two of his companies  but that is not likely to happen with this first daughter  I mean  we were friendly   he says of Ivanka  in the time before Mr  Trump became president   I would sit next to her every once in a while at a dinner  And I  as everyone did  was like   Oh  my God  how could this evil character have spawned such a polite  gracious person   I don t think we feel that way now  At 76  having seen around the corner to tech and pulled together the ragtag group of internet ventures at IAC into a thriving whole  Mr  Diller has  mellowed beautifully   as one producer here who has known him for many years puts it His dogs are jumping up on our chairs  He has three Jack Russell terriers cloned from his late  beloved dog Shannon  a Gaelic orphan he found wandering many years ago on a back road in Ireland For about  100 000  a South Korean firm  reincarnated  Shannon in three pups  Tess  short for  test tube   and DiNA  a play on DNA  who live in Beverly Hills  and Evita  who lives in Cloudwalk  the Connecticut home of Mr  Diller and Ms  von Furstenberg  These dogs  they re the soul of Shannon   he says   Diane was horrified that I was doing this but she s switched now to say   Thank God you did   Mr  Diller has started a trend in Hollywood  inspiring his friend Barbra Streisand  desolate over the loss of her Coton de Tulear  Samantha  to clone her Doesn t he want to clone himself into a  Killer Diller   as his protégés  including Jeffrey Katzenberg  Michael Eisner and Uber s Dara Khosrowshahi  are known  God forbid   he says with a grimace I ask Mr  Diller what he thought of Sacha Baron Cohen s joke at David Geffen s recent birthday party at Jimmy Iovine s house in Los Angeles that Mr  Geffen  Mr  Diller and the other starry billionaires and millionaires there represented  the world s third largest economy   It is a funny joke   he says   It s close to true  Is it a cool club to be in  I wonder  or a back stabbing one  For me  it s stimulating   he says   Diane hates it  So I am both in it  because I like it  and ripped out of it  because Diane says   Too much money  too many rich people  let s go   I ve got a good personal boomerang process  He says he met Mr  Geffen  whom he considers  family   when the two were teenagers in the William Morris mailroom in Los Angeles  It s Christmastime and this scrawny person comes into the mailroom and he said   I m in the mailroom at William Morris in New York  I had a week off for the holiday so I wanted to come and work here   And I thought  Oh  my God  on your vacation   Because for me  vacation was Hawaii  We talk about how Hollywood has changed  and I ask how the  MeToo era will affect the content of movies   Red Sparrow  has some of the most violent and extreme sexual messiness that you could imagine   he says   O K   it was made a year and a half ago  Would it be made today in the same way  Probably so  So I don t think it affects content  I mean  if you take the effect of pornography on young people today  Pornography until recently was fairly staid  Today  online  pornography is so extreme and so varied  with such expressions of fetishism and other things that boys are seeing  The idea of normal sex and normal romance has to be adversely affected by that  Once  Hollywood taught us about desire and sex and romance  giving us a vocabulary for these experiences  But no more  I wonder what will happen as girls emboldened by the fall of male predators collide with boys indoctrinated by pornography  I see it in our companies  where the relationships between people are changing   Mr  Diller says   We recently had a formal complaint made by a woman who said that she was at a convention with her colleagues and she was asked to have a drink with her boss  Period  That was the complaint  And we said   Here s the thing  Anybody can ask you anything  other than let s presume something illegal  and you have the right to say  Yes  or  No   If it s  Yes   go in good health and if it s  No   then it s full stop   But the end result of that is a guy  let s presume he is heterosexual  and his boss  heterosexual  and guy asks guy for a drink and they go have a drink and they talk about career opportunities  And the boss says   Oh  this is a smart guy  I m promoting him   A woman now cannot be in that position  So all these things are a changin   God knows  I m hardly a sociologist  But I hope in the future for some form of reconciliation  Because I think all men are guilty  I m not talking about rape and pillage  I m not talking about Harveyesque  I m talking about all of the spectrum  From an aggressive flirt  Or even just a flirty flirt that has one sour note in it  Or what I think every man was guilty of  some form of omission in attitude  in his views  Are we really going to have only capital punishment  Because right now  that s what we have  You get accused  you re obliterated  Charlie Rose ceases to exist  Mr  Diller is the chairman of the board of Expedia  and his IAC owns a gaggle of internet properties  including Vimeo  Dictionary com  Investopedia  Tinder  Match and OkCupid  I wonder how he thinks online dating is reshaping the culture  It s just like the princess phone evolved to the internet   he says   Match com has caused God knows how many more marriages than bars ever did  And now I m starting to hear that out of Tinder  It s funny  though  on Bumble  the women get to choose first and they don t want to  I liked the sheer adventure of romance before online dating  which is less appealing to me  I ask Mr  Diller  a Los Angeles native  about a comment made to me by the playwright and TV writer Jon Robin Baitz  another Los Angeles native  that Hollywood is no longer relevant politically and culturally  Does Hollywood reflect in any possible sense what is happening in the world   Mr  Baitz asked   Hollywood abdicated films and became an empty exercise in male capes and superheroes  Can you imagine anyone now making  Norma Rae    Silkwood    Five Easy Pieces    Reds   Since Mr  Diller was running Paramount in 1981 when Warren Beatty and Diane Keaton made Mr  Beatty s epic  Reds   he should know  What an undertaking   Mr  Diller says   But isn t it amazing how it holds  Calling  Red Sparrow   awful  and  The Shape of Water   beautiful but silly   he says he wouldn t want to run a movie studio now   It would be like saying  do I want to own a horse and buggy company  The idea of a movie is losing its meaning  Of the Academy Awards nominees this year  he said   essentially  no one went to see them  Growing up in Beverly Hills with a father in the construction business   he says there are still streets out here named  Dillerdale  and  Barrydale    Mr  Diller was able to see the twilight of the men who invented Hollywood  They were real characters   overblown  exuberant  nasty  but each of them in their own way were genuinely interesting people   he says   The only thing that I ve learned  that I think I ve had some instinct for  is instinct  And these people operated completely out of instinct  As against today  when people operate out of research and marketing  He says that Netflix and Amazon have blasted Hollywood into  a completely different universe   It s something that s never happened in media before  when Netflix got a lot of subscribers early on and made the brilliant decision to pour it into original production  like spending more than  100 million dollars to make  House of Cards   instead of buying old stuff   he says   It blows my mind  It s like a giant vacuum cleaner came and pushed all the other vacuum cleaners aside  And they cannot be outbid  No one can compete with them  He calls Reed Hastings  the C E O  of Netflix  the most remarkable person in the media business   He has so much original thinking in so many different areas  he s really impressive  I ask how the tech community s noxious bro culture will affect the business here  given that Hollywood already has such entrenched sexism  They re tech people   he says with a shrug   They don t have a lot of romance in them  They don t have a lot of nuance in them  Their lives are ones and zeros   But they can grow  he says   When I met Bill Gates  I would say he had the emotional quotient of a snail  And now you can see him cry  He corrects me when I call the tech titans our overlords   Our overlords are not them   he says   Our overlords are artificial intelligence  At several points during our three hour interview  Mr  Diller stops to ask me if this is any fun  When I assure him it s fascinating  he looks skeptical  Yeah  right   he says   Don t seduce me  I m a very seducible person   He also says he s a  jinxable  person Ms  von Furstenberg says that when she met Mr  Diller 43 years ago   What I found so incredibly appealing is that behind the very forceful  determined and engaged human being  there was shyness and reservation  He s not a pig  I mean  in no way  He impressed her immediately on a trip to Vegas by driving his banana yellow Jaguar E Type sports car barefoot and talking a policeman out of giving him a speeding ticket On another occasion  driving back into Manhattan fast from her Connecticut house   Mr  Diller likes to drive fast   they saw an octogenarian couple crossing the street slowly  holding on to each other  Both of us at the same time thought exactly the same thing   One day  we will be that couple    she recalls   The only thing we disagree on is  he thinks it was Madison Avenue and I say it was Lexington  The other quality his friends talk about is his voracious curiosity  When he knows about something  he knows more about it than anyone else  and when he doesn t know something  he wants to know more about it than anybody else   says Scott Rudin  who has produced movies  plays and television with Mr  Diller  including  Lady Bird  for the screen and  Betrayal    The Humans    A Doll s House  Part 2    Three Tall Women  and  Carousel  for Broadway   Mr  Rudin is also helping his friend develop the so called Diller Island  an undulating pier floating on piles in the Hudson River adjacent to the meatpacking district Given that Mr  Diller helped create the Fox Broadcasting Company with Rupert Murdoch   and blessedly greenlighted  The Simpsons    I wonder if he feels like Dr  Frankenstein  I left Fox before Fox News came into being   he says  About the sale of Fox to Disney  he notes that his former boss  played a bad hand very well  I observe that he called Harvey Weinstein out publicly as a bully early on Mr  Diller recalls that once in Cannes  when he was the chief executive of Universal  Stacey Snider  the head of the movie division  told him that  Harvey had treated her terribly and made her cry  So the next day I saw Harvey on the terrace at Hotel du Cap and I said   Harvey  don t ever treat an executive at my company that way  Don t you ever talk to anyone in that manner   And Harvey  about six feet away  said   I m going to throw you off the terrace   And this gorilla  because he looks like a gorilla  starts walking towards me  right  And truly  I was scared  I thought  how  without cutting and running like a chicken  do I stop him  And somehow a bear came into my mind   He says he pulled himself up into a menacing stance  as you re supposed to do if you have to confront a bear  And it so surprised him that he stopped and I got out with a small amount of honor   he says  Ms  Snider told Kim Masters in a 2007 Esquire article that Mr  Diller was such a tough boss that she teared up with him  after she made a blunder at a meeting  Mr  Diller apologized to her afterward  He adds   Other than psychopaths  I think all of this bad behavior is finished  Speaking of bad behavior  I ask if he knew Mr  Trump back in the day in Manhattan He said that when he was in his mid 30s  running Paramount  Mr  Trump invited him to lunch  And you know when people compliment you without foundation   Mr  Diller says   And they do it too much  It s really irritating  It s kind of offensive  And he spent the entire time saying how great I was  He didn t know me  And afterward  I walked around the corner and I thought   I never want to see that man again   Decades passed and we would run into each other  but I literally never spoke to him again  He says he has gone to a couple of Broadway shows recently with Hillary Clinton and that  she s well with herself again and she has a role to play  After the interview  when the Cambridge Analytica scandal breaks  I call him to see what he makes of Facebook s role  Since the beginning of media and advertising  the holy grail has

"WASHINGTON   Sitting in a hotel bar  Alexander Nix  who runs the political data firm Cambridge Analytica  had a few ideas for a prospective client looking for help in a foreign election  The firm could send an attractive woman to seduce a rival candidate and secretly videotape the encounter  Mr  Nix said  or send someone posing as a wealthy land developer to pass a bribe  We have a long history of working behind the scenes   Mr  Nix said The prospective client  though  was actually a reporter from Channel 4 News in Britain  and the encounter was secretly filmed as part of a monthslong investigation into Cambridge Analytica  the data firm with ties to President Trump s 2016 campaign The results of Channel 4 s work were broadcast in Britain on Monday  days after reports in The New York Times and The Observer of London that the firm had harvested the data from more than 50 million Facebook profiles in its bid to develop techniques for predicting the behavior of individual American voters The weekend s reports about the data misuse have prompted calls from lawmakers in Britain and the United States for renewed scrutiny of Facebook  and at least two American state prosecutors have said they are looking into the misuse of data by Cambridge Analytica Now  the Channel 4 broadcast appears likely to cast an even harsher spotlight on the company  which was founded by Stephen K  Bannon and Robert Mercer  a wealthy Republican donor who has put at least  15 million into Cambridge Analytica The firm s so called psychographic modeling techniques  which were built in part with the data harvested from Facebook  underpinned its work for the Trump campaign in 2016  though many have questioned their effectiveness Less noticed has been the work that Cambridge Analytica and its parent company  the SCL Group  have done outside the United States  The operations of the two companies were set up with a convoluted corporate structure and are deeply intertwined Mr  Nix  for instance  holds dual appointments at the two companies  Cambridge Analytica is registered in Delaware and almost wholly owned by the Mercer family  but it is effectively a shell   it holds intellectual property rights to its so called psychographic modeling tools  yet its clients are served by the staff at London based SCL and overseen by Mr  Nix  who is a British citizen SCL Elections has clients around the world  and it has experimented with data driven microtargeting techniques in the Caribbean and Africa  where privacy rules are lax or nonexistent and politicians employing SCL have been happy to provide government held data  according to former employees  ALSO READ  How Cambridge Analytica Harvested Facebook Data  Triggering a New Outcry But in the footage broadcast by Channel 4  Mr  Nix offered services that go far beyond data harvesting  The Times did not work with Channel 4 on its report about Cambridge Analytica  Many of our clients don t want to be seen to be working with a foreign company   he told the Channel 4 reporter  who was not identified   We can set up fake IDs and websites  we can be students doing research projects attached to a university  we can be tourists  There s so many options we can look at  The Channel 4 reporter posed as a  fixer  for a wealthy Sri Lankan family that wanted to help politicians they favored  In a series of meetings at London hotels between November and January  all of which were secretly filmed  Mr  Nix and other executives boasted that Cambridge Analytica employs front companies and former spies on behalf of political clients The information that is uncovered through such clandestine work is then put  into the bloodstream to the internet   said Mark Turnbull  another Cambridge executive  in an encounter in December 2017 at the Berkeley hotel in London  Then watch it grow  give it a little push every now and again  over time  to watch it take shape   he added   It has to happen without anyone thinking   That s propaganda   Because the moment you think  that s propaganda   the next question is   Who s put that out   The most damning footage  though  was of Mr  Nix s suggestion that the company could entrap political rivals through seduction or bribery At a meeting in January  also at the Berkeley hotel  Mr  Nix was direct about the techniques SCL could use to aid a client  I mean  deep digging is interesting   he said   But you know equally effective can be just to go and speak to the incumbents and to offer them a deal that s too good to be true  and make sure that that s video recorded  you know  These sorts of tactics are very effective  instantly having video evidence of corruption  putting it on the internet  these sorts of things  Mr  Nix then suggested they could have someone pose as a wealthy developer   They will offer a large amount of money to the candidate  to finance his campaign in exchange for land for instance   he said   We ll have the whole thing recorded on cameras  Or  Mr  Nix said  they could  send some girls around to the candidate s house   we have lots of history of things  The reporter asked what kind of girls  and Mr  Nix said they could find some Ukrainian women   I m just saying  we could bring some Ukrainians in on holiday with us you know   Mr  Nix replied   You know what I m saying   They are very beautiful   he said   I find that works very well  To be sure  though  Mr  Nix said that he was speaking only in hypotheticals   Please don t pay too much attention to what I m saying because I m just giving you examples of what can be done and what  what has been done   he said Cambridge Analytica  in a statement issued after the Channel 4 broadcast  said the report was  edited and scripted to grossly misrepresent the nature of those conversations and how the company conducts its business  The company said that it was the undercover reporter who had raised the idea of entrapping politicians  and that the executives had been trying to assess his intent  Mr  Nix and Mr  Turnbull  humored these questions and actively encouraged the prospective client to disclose his intentions   it said  They left with grave concerns and did not meet with him again   the company said For Mr  Nix  the footage comes at an already perilous moment  Earlier this month  he told a parliamentary inquiry into fake news and Russian interference in Britain s referendum to exit the European Union that Cambridge Analytica never used or possessed Facebook data But following the reports in The Times and Observer on Saturday  Damian Collins  the Conservative lawmaker leading the inquiry  said he planned to call Mr  Nix back to testify  It seems clear that he has deliberately misled the committee and Parliament   Mr  Collins said in a statement this weekend Elizabeth Denham  the British information commissioner  told Channel 4 News that on March 7 she asked for access to Cambridge Analytica  setting a deadline of 6 p m  Monday  Ms  Denham said she did not accept the response as satisfactory and so would be applying in court on Tuesday for a warrant  We need to look at the databases  we need to look at the servers and understand how the data was processed   she said In a statement  Facebook said that it had  hired a digital forensics firm  Stroz Friedberg  to conduct a comprehensive audit of Cambridge Analytica  But Mr  Collins  who is chairman of the House of Commons digital  culture  media and sport committee  said he was concerned that Facebook might gain access to data before the information commissioner did  What are they doing   Mr  Collins asked on Channel 4 News   Are they going in to physically recover data  to disturb the files  This investigation should be for the authorities  Mr  Collins said that the former Cambridge Analytica employee who came forward to disclose his company s actions  Christopher Wylie  would be giving evidence to his committee  He said he wanted Mark Zuckerberg  or another senior executive from Facebook  to do the same "
"As a start up called Cambridge Analytica sought to harvest the Facebook data of tens of millions of Americans in summer 2014  the company received help from at least one employee at Palantir Technologies  a top Silicon Valley contractor to American spy agencies and the Pentagon It was a Palantir employee in London  working closely with the data scientists building Cambridge s psychological profiling technology  who suggested the scientists create their own app   a mobile phone based personality quiz   to gain access to Facebook users  friend networks  according to documents obtained by The New York Times Cambridge ultimately took a similar approach  By early summer  the company found a university researcher to harvest data using a personality questionnaire and Facebook app  The researcher scraped private data from over 50 million Facebook users   and Cambridge Analytica went into business selling so called psychometric profiles of American voters  setting itself on a collision course with regulators and lawmakers in the United States and Britain  Read more about the Cambridge Analytica whistle blower contending that data mining swung the Brexit referendum  The revelations pulled Palantir   co founded by the wealthy libertarian Peter Thiel   into the furor surrounding Cambridge  which improperly obtained Facebook data to build analytical tools it deployed on behalf of Donald J  Trump and other Republican candidates in 2016  Mr  Thiel  a supporter of President Trump  serves on the board at Facebook  There were senior Palantir employees that were also working on the Facebook data   said Christopher Wylie  a data expert and Cambridge Analytica co founder  in testimony before British lawmakers on Tuesday Cambridge Analytica has found itself confronting a deepening crisis since reports about the firm s data harvesting were published this month in The New York Times  The Observer of London and The Guardian The connections between Palantir and Cambridge Analytica were thrust into the spotlight by Mr  Wylie s testimony on Tuesday  Both companies are linked to tech driven billionaires who backed Mr  Trump s campaign  Cambridge is chiefly owned by Robert Mercer  the computer scientist and hedge fund magnate  while Palantir was co founded in 2003 by Mr  Thiel  who was an initial investor in Facebook The Palantir employee  Alfredas Chmieliauskas  works on business development for the company  according to his LinkedIn page  In an initial statement  Palantir said it had  never had a relationship with Cambridge Analytica  nor have we ever worked on any Cambridge Analytica data   Later on Tuesday  Palantir revised its account  saying that Mr  Chmieliauskas was not acting on the company s behalf when he advised Mr  Wylie on the Facebook data  We learned today that an employee  in 2013 2014  engaged in an entirely personal capacity with people associated with Cambridge Analytica   the company said   We are looking into this and will take the appropriate action  The company said it was continuing to investigate but knew of no other employees who took part in the effort  Mr  Wylie told lawmakers that multiple Palantir employees played a role Documents and interviews indicate that starting in 2013  Mr  Chmieliauskas began corresponding with Mr  Wylie and a colleague from his Gmail account  At the time  Mr  Wylie and the colleague worked for the British defense and intelligence contractor SCL Group  which formed Cambridge Analytica with Mr  Mercer the next year  The three shared Google documents to brainstorm ideas about using big data to create sophisticated behavioral profiles  a product code named  Big Daddy  A former intern at SCL   Sophie Schmidt  the daughter of Eric Schmidt  then Google s executive chairman   urged the company to link up with Palantir  according to Mr  Wylie s testimony and a June 2013 email viewed by The Times  Ever come across Palantir  Amusingly Eric Schmidt s daughter was an intern with us and is trying to push us towards them   one SCL employee wrote to a colleague in the email Ms  Schmidt did not respond to requests for comment  nor did a spokesman for Cambridge Analytica In early 2013  Alexander Nix  an SCL director who became chief executive of Cambridge Analytica  and a Palantir executive discussed working together on election campaigns A Palantir spokeswoman acknowledged that the companies had briefly considered working together but said that Palantir declined a partnership  in part because executives there wanted to steer clear of election work  Emails reviewed by The Times indicate that Mr  Nix and Mr  Chmieliauskas sought to revive talks about a formal partnership through early 2014  but Palantir executives again declined In his testimony  Mr  Wylie acknowledged that Palantir and Cambridge Analytica never signed a contract or entered into a formal business relationship  But he said some Palantir employees helped engineer Cambridge s psychographic models  There were Palantir staff who would come into the office and work on the data   Mr  Wylie told lawmakers   And we would go and meet with Palantir staff at Palantir   He did not provide an exact number for the employees or identify them Palantir employees were impressed with Cambridge s backing from Mr  Mercer  one of the world s richest men  according to messages viewed by The Times  And Cambridge Analytica viewed Palantir s Silicon Valley ties as a valuable resource for launching and expanding its own business In an interview this month with The Times  Mr  Wylie said that Palantir employees were eager to learn more about using Facebook data and psychographics  Those discussions continued through spring 2014  according to Mr  Wylie Mr  Wylie said that he and Mr  Nix visited Palantir s London office on Soho Square  One side was set up like a high security office  Mr  Wylie said  with separate rooms that could be entered only with particular codes  The other side  he said  was like a tech start up    weird inspirational quotes and stuff on the wall and free beer  and there s a Ping Pong table  Mr  Chmieliauskas continued to communicate with Mr  Wylie s team in 2014  as the Cambridge employees were locked in protracted negotiations with a researcher at Cambridge University  Michal Kosinski  to obtain Facebook data through an app Mr  Kosinski had built  The data was crucial to efficiently scale up Cambridge s psychometrics products so they could be used in elections and for corporate clients  I had left field idea   Mr  Chmieliauskas wrote in May 2014   What about replicating the work of the cambridge prof as a mobile app that connects to facebook   Reproducing the app  Mr  Chmieliauskas wrote   could be a valuable leverage negotiating with the guy  Those negotiations failed  But Mr  Wylie struck gold with another Cambridge researcher  the Russian American psychologist Aleksandr Kogan  who built his own personality quiz app for Facebook  Over subsequent months  Dr  Kogan s work helped Cambridge develop psychological profiles of millions of American voters "

"If there was one broad takeaway from the data leak involving Cambridge Analytica  the voter profiling firm that obtained private information from up to 87 million Facebook accounts  it s that you should hesitate before sharing your data with an unknown brand This lesson applies to just about everything that touches your personal technology  including the apps that you download to your phone or computer and the free online services that you use  And  yes  it also includes those seemingly harmless personality tests run by some unfamiliar organization on Facebook   the kind that helped Cambridge Analytica get the data on users To make matters worse  the information that can be stolen from you is becoming increasingly personal  Smartphones  for one  are embedded with microphones  motion sensors and cameras that can spy on your every move if corrupted by a bad actor  Home gadgets like internet connected thermostats  power outlets and audio speakers are capable of collecting information about what you are doing at home  including listening to your conversations  and knowing when you are away from home It s time to stop using technology and the internet as though you were shopping at a supermarket  In a grocery store  you can reasonably assume that the food labels are accurate and the products safe to eat  because the food industry is heavily regulated  The handling of personal digital information  in contrast  is  loosely regulated  There have been scores of obscure companies baiting you with products that purport to improve your life   but actually capitalize on your data  We don t really know why we re trusting that a particular company with access to our data won t do something like sell it or rent it or share it without our consent   said Lee Tien  a lawyer for the Electronic Frontier Foundation  a nonprofit that focuses on digital rights That s not to say the tech behemoths are innocent  The data leak to Cambridge Analytica was ultimately Facebook s fault because its app platform allowed data to be harvested from people s friends lists in the first place  About five years ago  Google had to pay a  7 million fine after acknowledging that it had scooped up passwords  email and other personal data with its Street View mapping project Yet I am recommending taking extra caution with obscure tech brands because it is something under your control  You can take a pause  Don t immediately download every app you see in an app store or on the web just because it looks fun  Don t take every quiz you see on Facebook  even if you are dying to know which  Game of Thrones  character identifies with you   Don t impulse buy internet connected devices from unfamiliar brands  Don t do any of this without first doing some research on the reputations of these vendors and their business models Here are some examples of when unknown brands did us wrong   and the lessons we can learn Last year  The New York Times revealed that Uber bought information about Lyft  its main ride hailing competitor in the United States  from Unroll me  a free email service that offered to unsubscribe people from marketing emails How did Unroll me get data about Lyft  Unroll me scanned users  inboxes for information and sold it to other businesses  and Uber paid it for data it found about Lyft receipts  Many consumers found it misleading that a company that promised to rid you of spam from marketers made money by selling your information to marketers and other companies Here s the kicker  The truth was always laid out in the privacy policy  which said that  we may collect  use  transfer  sell and disclose nonpersonal information for any purpose  and that data could be used  to build anonymous market research products and services  In response to the backlash  Unroll me said it was  heartbreaking  to see that people were upset and pledged to be more transparent about its use of data  The app continues to operate The lessons  Whenever you have the time  read privacy policies before opting to share your data with a brand  This is a daunting task but a healthy exercise  especially when you are unfamiliar and feeling distrustful toward an obscure company  And do the best you can to research a company s business model  When a service or product is free  assume that your personal information is being monetized  We all need to know that whenever you re not paying for the thing  then you re paying for the thing in a nonmonetary way   Mr  Tien said Last year  an app called Soniac was available for Android phones on the Google Play app store  Soniac marketed itself as a messaging app   and indeed  it included features for sending text messages  The less obvious features  The app was also capable of silently recording audio  taking photos with the camera  placing phone calls and downloading call logs among other features Lookout  a security firm that follows malicious software for Android devices  alerted Google about Soniac s hidden abilities last year  and the app was quickly removed from the Play app store Yet Lookout said its researchers had identified over 1 000 spyware apps with many of the same characteristics that Soniac had  Many of those spyware apps were served in third party app stores that are not authorized by Google The company that offered Soniac  Iraqwebservice  had published other spyware apps on the Play store  All of its apps have been removed from Play  but Lookout warned that the spyware would probably resurface in the future The lessons  For one  before you install an app from a company you ve never heard of  look at its user reviews and do a web search on the company to see if its services are legitimate  You can also check reputable web publications that review apps  like TouchArcade  CNET and Tom s Guide For another  when installing an app  take a close look at what data it is accessing  Smartphone apps will ask for permission for access to certain data and sensors  If an app is asking for data that is unrelated to the product  don t install it  For example  you can reasonably expect a mapping app to ask for your location data  but it shouldn t need access to your camera  If something seems outside of the scope  like if a calculator app tells you it needs to use your webcam  say   What  why    said Adam Kujawa  the head of malware intelligence at Malwarebytes  a security firm Third  avoid downloading apps from unofficial app stores and sites that are not affiliated with large brands  And keep in mind that alternative app stores are particularly ripe for malware  because just about anything can be distributed there  similar to a flea market Parents  beware  A number of internet products have specifically collected data about children  EchoMetrix is a notorious example  In 2009  the company issued a news release bragging that it had predicted the winner of that year s  American Idol  singing competition How did it do that  By looking at children s private information  The company started in 2004 with the name SearchHelp  offering a parental control app called FamilySafe for parents to monitor their children s online activities  Five years later  it rebranded itself as EchoMetrix and released Pulse  a tool for providing insight to third party marketers on youths  by aggregating data from millions of teenagers  chat transcripts and blog posts  among other sources EchoMetrix s practices attracted the attention of the Electronic Privacy Information Center  a privacy rights group  which filed a complaint about the company to the Federal Trade Commission  The group accused EchoMetrix of violating the Children s Online Privacy Protection Act by collecting information on minors without parental consent  In 2010  EchoMetrix reached settlements with the commission and the New York attorney general s office in which it agreed not to analyze or share information about children s private communications or online activities  EchoMetrix has since rebranded itself as Protext Mobility  a biotech company The lessons  Be judicious when choosing tech products for your children  Increasingly  toys are beginning to include internet connections   before buying a  smart  toy  do your homework on what the companies are doing with the data  Common Sense Media  a nonprofit that evaluates content and products for families  is a good place to start your research Perhaps the most important lesson is to acknowledge that you don t know anything about the vast majority of brands you engage with on the internet  So tread carefully  These threats aren t going away   Mr  Tien said   With the expansion of data collection and the expansion of what s possible to collect  it s just going to continue to proliferate  "
" One of our biggest responsibilities is to protect data  That s what Mark Zuckerberg  Facebook s chief executive and co founder  said just over a week ago after revelations that the data research firm Cambridge Analytica had gained access to the profiles of 50 million Facebook users Over the past year  the downside of social media companies   Facebook foremost among them   has become glaringly apparent  They have been platforms for information campaigns that influenced elections and endangered lives  They have failed to keep users  personal information private  And the carefully targeted ads that appear on them can be  well  creepy Now the drumbeat for regulation of social media on both sides of the aisle   and from many in Silicon Valley   is getting louder by the day   I think that this certain situation is so dire and has become so large that probably some well crafted regulation is necessary   Tim Cook  Apple s chief executive  said recently Mr  Zuckerberg may be getting tired of other executives sniping at his company  but he needs to come up with a solution   fast  For several weeks  I ve been canvassing various technology executives  privacy advocates  academics and others to come up with some ideas about exactly what Facebook could do to fix itself It is not clear that Facebook will be able to stave off regulators  but Mr  Zuckerberg and his colleagues might want to consider this  a  Why Me   button   Google  Amazon and others might want to take note  too  Facebook suffers from a lack of trust because of the asymmetrical nature of the relationship users have with it  We provide it all sorts of information  But we have no idea how the information is being used  how our data is being harvested  how that data is being commingled and cross referenced with other data sets and ultimately sold to advertisers   Facebook already has a button  relatively buried in a list of other items  that it calls  Why Am I Seeing This Ad   It is  to some degree  a crippled version of what I m suggesting should be introduced on all of Facebook s properties  To his credit  Mr  Zuckerberg does appear to recognize the problem that his company faces over privacy concerns  After acknowledging that protecting users  data is one of the company s biggest responsibilities  he went on to say   If you think about what our services are  at their most basic level  you put some content into a service  whether it s a photo or a video or a text message   whether it s Facebook or WhatsApp or Instagram   and you re trusting that that content is going to be shared with the people you want to share it with  But the solution Facebook offered last week   putting all of your privacy settings on one screen and blocking some third parties from access to data   is just a Band Aid  It s a start  but it doesn t provide a road map for how your information is being used That s where the  Why Me   button could help  This button would sit next to every advertisement and piece of content that appears before you on all of Facebook s properties  including Instagram and WhatsApp If you saw an ad or an article pop up on your screen  you could click the  Why Me   button  Then you would see a full explanation of why that item was pushed to you The  Why Me   explanation would not just include the name of the advertiser  but what keywords  demographics or other information the advertiser specifically targeted  It would also offer a full rundown of how your information fit into the parameters of the advertiser s request and where that information came from Maybe Facebook saw that you had clicked on a pair of sneakers on a different service that shares information with Facebook  The  Why Me   section would show you when and where that information was collected  Did Facebook notice you searched for a new cellphone plan  Facebook would tell how it knew that  too Did Facebook use artificial intelligence to find your face in an image without you or anyone else labeling it  The  Why Me   section would show you the images that the artificial intelligence system cross referenced to identify you  Did Facebook scrape another site or buy information about you that it commingled with the data that you had provided  It would tell you that  too Most important  at every point in the  explanation tree   the user would have the option to turn off or disable that specific piece of data  Facebook  of course  could   and probably should   explain the trade offs of such decisions The  Why Me   button could also be extended to content  When a friend or company shares a post  Facebook doesn t just display it to everyone listed as the poster s friend or follower  Facebook s algorithms choose which friends and followers see it based on all sorts of parameters  usually related to the kind of content or how you ve interacted with the friend in the past The  Why Me   button should explain all the data points that are used in the calculation and how they are weighted The current  Why Am I Seeing This Ad   often says something like   Company A wants to reach people ages 18 and older who live or were recently in the United States  This is information based on your Facebook profile and where you ve connected to the internet  But it hardly tells you the whole story  Facebook doesn t say so explicitly  but it allows companies to upload their own databases  cross reference them with Facebook s data and use that information to serve ads to users  It also doesn t say how that other site originally got that information about who you are In fairness  the  Why Me   button might create all sorts of problems for Facebook  and its advertisers  too  It would allow users   and rivals   to reverse engineer much of the way the system works  And advertisers would probably object to the idea of making their targeting plans public  But that would be the cost of using such large public platforms with such exact targeting It has become something of a cliché  but in 1913  before he became a Supreme Court justice  Louis D  Brandeis said   Sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants  It could well be applied today at Facebook   and its peer companies   if it wants to avoid a governmental crackdown "

"WASHINGTON    The leading U S  consumer protection regulator and attorneys representing 37 states stepped up pressure on Facebook Inc on Monday to explain how the social network allowed data of 50 million users get into the hands of a political consultancy The U S  Federal Trade Commission took the unusual step of announcing that it had opened an investigation into the company   which it generally only does in cases of great public interest   citing media reports that raise what it called  substantial concerns about the privacy practices of Facebook  On the same day  a bipartisan coalition of 37 state attorneys wrote to Facebook  demanding to know more about the company s role in the manipulation of users  data by the consultancy  Cambridge Analytica  which used it to target U S  and British voters in close run elections  These revelations raise many serious questions concerning Facebook s policies and practices  and the processes in place to ensure they are followed   the letter said   We need to know that users can trust Facebook  With the information we have now  our trust has been broken  Facebook shares fell as much as 6 5 percent  briefly dipping below  150 for the first time since July 2017  before recovering the day s losses to close up 0 4 percent at  160 06 The shares are still down 13 percent since March 16  when Facebook first acknowledged that user data had been improperly channelled to Cambridge Analytica  The company has lost more than  70 billion   49 1 billion  in market value since then The recovery in Facebook s stock on Monday may have been due to investors taking advantage of the lower stock price and the belief that the latest regulatory scrutiny may not ultimately hurt the company s relative long term growth prospects  Wall Street analysts said The FTC investigation is looking at more than whether Facebook violated a 2011 consent order it reached with the FTC over its privacy practices  a person briefed on the matter told Reuters If the FTC finds Facebook violated terms of the consent decree  it has the power to fine it thousands of dollars a day per violation  which could add up to billions of dollars  We remain strongly committed to protecting people s information   Facebook Deputy Chief Privacy Officer Rob Sherman said in a statement on Monday   We appreciate the opportunity to answer questions the FTC may have  ALL APOLOGIESLawmakers in the United States and Europe continue to pressure Facebook and Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg to explain the company s privacy practices The U S  Senate Judiciary Committee said on Monday it had invited Zuckerberg and the CEOs of Alphabet Inc and Twitter Inc to testify at an April 10 hearing on data privacy The U S  House Energy and Commerce Committee and U S  Senate Commerce Committee have already formally asked Zuckerberg to appear at a congressional hearing  Facebook s failure to protect confidential user information likely violated specific legally binding commitments  but also basic norms and standards   said U S  Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal  a member of the Senate Commerce  Science  and Transportation Committee In Europe  the European Union Justice Commissioner asked  Facebook if the company is  absolutely certain  that the Cambridge Analytica incident could not be repeated Zuckerberg apologised last week for the mistakes the company had made and he promised to restrict developers  access to user information as part of a plan to protect privacy  He also said sorry in full page advertisements in British and U S  newspapers  The was a breach of trust  and I m sorry we didn t do more at the time   Zuckerberg said in the ads   We are now taking steps to make sure this doesn t happen again   FUTURE REGULATION His apologies have failed to quell discontent  Germany s justice minister said Facebook s promises were not enough  In future we will have to regulate companies like Facebook much more strictly   Katarina Barley said after talks to which she summoned Facebook executives including European public affairs chief Richard Allan Advertisers and users are also unhappy U S  auto parts retailer Pep Boys suspended all advertising on Facebook on Monday while wireless speaker maker Sonos said in a blog post it will remove advertising from Facebook  Instagram  Twitter and Alphabet s YouTube for one week Internet company Mozilla Corp  Germany s second largest bank Commerzbank AG and British advertising group ISBA all suspended advertising on Facebook last week Opinion polls published on Sunday in the United States and Germany cast doubt over the trust people have in Facebook Fewer than half of Americans trust Facebook to obey U S  privacy laws  according to a Reuters Ipsos poll released on Sunday

"NEW YORK    Facebook revealed Wednesday that tens of millions more people might have been exposed in the Cambridge Analytica privacy scandal than previously thought and said it will restrict the user data that outsiders can access Those developments came as congressional officials said CEO Mark Zuckerberg will testify next week  while Facebook unveiled a new privacy policy that aims to explain the data it gathers on users more clearly   but doesn t actually change what it collects and shares In a call with reporters Wednesday  Zuckerberg acknowledged he made a  huge mistake  in failing to take a broad enough view of what Facebook s responsibility is in the world  He said it isn t enough for Facebook to believe app developers when they say they follow the rules  He says Facebook has to ensure they do Facebook is facing its worst privacy scandal in years following allegations that Cambridge Analytica  a Trump affiliated data mining firm  used ill gotten data from millions of users through an app to try to influence elections Facebook said Wednesday that as many as 87 million people might have had their data accessed   an increase from the 50 million disclosed in published reports  Facebook is basing the estimate in part on the number of friends each user might have had  Cambridge Analytica said in a statement that it had data for only 30 million people On Monday all Facebook users will receive a notice on their Facebook feeds with a link to see what apps they use and what information they have shared with those apps  They ll have a chance to delete apps they no longer want  Users who might have had their data shared with Cambridge Analytica will be told of that  Facebook says most of the affected users are in the U S Zuckerberg said fixing the company s problems will take years Besides the privacy scandal  Facebook also has been dealing with fake news  the use of Facebook to spread hate and discord and concerns about social media s effect on people s mental well being These are  big issues  and a big shift for Facebook as it broadens its responsibility  Zuckerberg said  He added that he does think that by the end of this year the company will have  turned a corner  on a lot of the issues  Zuckerberg has made fixing the company his personal challenge for 2018 As part of the steps it s taking to address scrutiny about outsiders  access to user data  Facebook outlined several changes to further tighten its policies  For one  it is restricting access that apps can have to data about users  events  as well as information about groups such as member lists and content In addition  the company is also removing the option to search for users by entering a phone number or an email address  While this helped individuals find friends  Facebook says businesses that had phone or email information on customers were able to collect profile information this way  Facebook says it believes most of its 2 2 billion users had their public profile information scraped by businesses or various malicious actors through this technique at some point  Posts and other content set to be visible only to friends weren t collected This comes on top of changes announced a few weeks ago  For example  Facebook has said it will remove developers  access to people s data if the person has not used the app in three months Earlier Wednesday  Facebook unveiled a new privacy policy that seeks to clarify its data collection and use Although Facebook says the policy changes aren t prompted by recent events or tighter privacy rules coming from the EU  it s an opportune time  Zuckerberg is set to testify April 10 before a joint hearing of the Senate Commerce and Judiciary Committees  and a day later before the House Energy and Commerce Committee   The two sessions will be his first testimony before Congress  Separately  the U S  Federal Trade Commission and various authorities in Europe are investigating As Facebook evolved from a closed  Harvard only network with no ads to a giant corporation with  40 billion in advertising revenue and huge subsidiaries like Instagram and WhatsApp  its privacy policy has also shifted   over and over Almost always  critics say  the changes meant a move away from protecting user privacy toward pushing openness and more sharing  On the other hand  regulatory and user pressure has sometimes led Facebook to pull back on its data collection and use and to explain things in plainer language   in contrast to dense legalese from many other internet companies The policy changes come a week after Facebook gave its privacy settings a makeover  The company tried to make it easier to navigate its complex and often confusing privacy and security settings  though the makeover didn t change what Facebook collects and shares either Facebook s new privacy policy has a new section explaining that it collects people s contact information if they choose to  upload  sync or import  this to the service  This may include users  address books on their phones  as well as their call logs and text histories  The new policy says Facebook may use this data to help  you and others find people you may know  Several users were surprised to learn recently that Facebook had been collecting information about whom they texted or called and for how long  though not the actual contents of text messages  It seemed to have been done without explicit consent  though Facebook says it collected such data only from Android users who specifically allowed it to do so   for instance  by agreeing to permissions when installing Facebook On Wednesday  Facebook said will delete all logs after a year and in the future  the only information this tool will collect from now on is the data that it needs to operate and  not broader data such as the time of calls  The new policy also makes it clear that WhatsApp and Instagram are part of Facebook and that the companies share information about users  WhatsApp will still have a separate policy as well  while Facebook and Instagram share one    This story has been corrected to reflect that WhatsApp has its own privacy policy  while Facebook and Instagram share the same one "
"WASHINGTON    Facebook isn t just a company  It s a behemoth  with 2 1 billion monthly users   40 billion in revenue and more than 25 000 employees worldwide And that leaves Washington with a daunting task  How do you tame a corporate giant  Or do you even try  It s tricky and it s going to be hard  but there are ways it can be dealt with   says Virginia Sen  Mark Warner  a former tech executive who has led investigations into Russian interference on social media over the last year as the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee   The idea that we re going to keep the wild  wild West   I don t think it s sustainable  The picture will begin to come into focus next week  Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is scheduled to testify April 10 and 11 before Senate and House committees as his company grapples with the privacy scandal involving Cambridge Analytica  a political consulting firm linked to President Donald Trump Facebook s reckoning in Washington comes on multiple fronts  Russia s use of the platform to meddle in U S  elections  a regulatory investigation that could result in fines of hundreds of millions of dollars against the company for privacy violations  and the Cambridge Analytica episode are all topmost concerns But in the capital s pro business  anti regulatory climate  it s questionable whether the Republican led Congress or Trump regulators have the appetite to rein it in Facebook is spending millions on lobbying to try to ward off regulations  even seeking to narrow a Senate bill that lawmakers call  the lightest touch possible   It would require more transparency in online political ads  something Facebook says it is providing on its own But the stakes grew Wednesday when Facebook revealed that information belonging to as many as 87 million of its users may have been improperly shared with Cambridge Analytica  which gathered the data with the intent of swaying elections  That number was far higher than originally known Congress  response to the myriad issues dogging Facebook could depend on Zuckerberg himself  He has apologized for a  major breach of trust  in the Cambridge Analytica episode and Facebook has announced it would stop working with third party data collectors Privacy advocates and legal experts say that s not enough  It strikes me as a company that is trying to weather a PR storm and then get back to business as usual and hoping their users forget this ever happened   said Nate Cardozo  a senior staff attorney for Electronic Frontier Foundation  a privacy group based in San Francisco Facebook and other social media companies have faced bipartisan criticism over both privacy issues and the Russian intervention  But Trump and his pro business GOP allies on Capitol Hill have made rolling back Obama era regulations a priority  which makes any new federal rules for protecting data and privacy unlikely in the immediate future Republicans last year struck down online privacy regulations issued during President Barack Obama s final months in office that would have given consumers more control over how companies like Comcast  AT T and Verizon share information  Critics complained that the rule would have increased costs  stifled innovation and picked winners and losers among internet companies And Congress elected to do nothing after Equifax disclosed in September that hackers exploited a software flaw that the credit monitoring company failed to fix  exposing Social Security numbers  birthdates and other personal data belonging to nearly 148 million Americans Lawmakers have yet to come up with a fix for the patchwork of conflicting state laws that govern how companies shield personal data and notify consumers when breaches occur  Mike Litt  consumer campaign director at U S  PIRG  a public interest group  said Congress instead is considering legislation that would exempt credit bureaus from data break notifications and make it harder for states to hold them accountable  After the Equifax data breach  we saw Congress talk a good game but fail to follow through on helping consumers   Litt said   To prevent Congress from letting Facebook off the hook  outraged Americans need to keep up the heat  To defend its interests in Washington  Facebook has filled its executive ranks with former senior government officials from both political parties  Nathaniel Gleicher  its director of cybersecurity policy  was in charge of cybersecurity policy at the National Security Council during the Obama administration  Joel Kaplan  Facebook s vice president for global public policy  served as a senior aide to President George W  Bush The company spent just over  13 million on lobbying in 2017  according to disclosure records filed with Congress  One of the lobbying team s newer members  Sandra Luff  was Attorney General Jeff Sessions  national security adviser when he served in the Senate Zuckerberg suggested during a CNN interview last month that he s open to regulation  But he quickly qualified that commitment  saying he d get behind the  right  kind of rules  such as the bill that requires online political ads to disclose who paid for them  But the company is seeking to weaken even that bill Warner acknowledged that even minor regulation of Facebook and other technology companies will be difficult  But he s encouraging them to work with Washington now  before a  catastrophic event  that could shift the landscape or if Democrats win back seats in November s elections He suggests several possibilities  requiring Facebook and other companies to disclose the country of origin of ads  creating a self regulatory body  or even allowing users to move their data from one platform to another More drastic measures could be to allow users to own their own data or to hold social media companies more responsible for what is posted on their platforms In Europe  Facebook and other tech giants like Google are bracing for tough new data privacy rules that take effect May 25 and will apply to any company that collects data on EU residents  no matter where it is based  The rules will make it easier for consumers to give and withdraw consent for the use of their data In the U S   Facebook s biggest challenge may come from the Federal Trade Commission  which is investigating whether the company violated the terms of a 2011 settlement that made privacy assurances Facebook agreed then to settle the commission s charges that it deceived users by assuring them their information would remain private  then repeatedly allowing it to be shared and made public  Each violation of the agreement could carry a penalty of up to  40 000  according to settlement terms  meaning potential fines in the hundreds of millions Frank Pasquale  a University of Maryland law professor who s written extensively about how corporations use personal data  said the federal government s antitrust enforcers should be more vigilant with Facebook Facebook has completed dozens of mergers and acquisitions since it was founded in 2004  Pasquale said the Obama administration failed to realize the significance of two of Facebook s largest purchases  the photo sharing app Instagram for  1 billion in 2012 and WhatsApp two years later for nearly  22 billion  This is clearly a monopolistic company that is trying to eliminate even the smallest challenge to its domination of the social media market   he said The privacy scandal has taken a heavy financial toll on Zuckerberg and Facebook  Forbes Magazine estimated that Zuckerberg s net worth dropped over the last month from  71 billion to  61 7 billion  Facebook s market value has fallen by more than  88 billion in less than three weeks since the scandal broke  from nearly  538 billion in mid March to about  449 5 billion    Associated Press writer Marley Jay in New York contributed to this report "

"SAN FRANCISCO   Worried about someone hacking the next election  Bothered by the way Facebook and Equifax coughed up your personal information The technology industry has an answer called the blockchain   even for the problems the industry helped to create The first blockchain was created in 2009 as a new kind of database for the virtual currency Bitcoin  where all transactions could be stored without any banks or governments involved Now  countless entrepreneurs  companies and governments are looking to use similar databases   often independent of Bitcoin   to solve some of the most intractable issues facing society  People feel the need to move away from something like Facebook and toward something that allows them to have ownership of their own data   said Ryan Shea  a co founder of Blockstack  a New York company working with blockchain technology The creator of the World Wide Web  Tim Berners Lee  has said the blockchain could help reduce the big internet companies  influence and return the web to his original vision  But he has also warned that it could come with some of the same problems as the web Blockchain allows information to be stored and exchanged by a network of computers without any central authority  In theory  this egalitarian arrangement also makes it harder for data to be altered or hacked Investors  for one  see potential  While the price of Bitcoin and other virtual currencies have plummeted this year  investment in other blockchain projects has remained strong  In the first three months of 2018  venture capitalists put half a billion dollars into 75 blockchain projects  more than double what they raised in the last quarter of 2017  according to data from Pitchbook Most of the projects have not gotten beyond pilot testing  and many are aimed at transforming mundane corporate tasks like financial trading and accounting  But some experiments promise to transform fundamental things  like the way we vote and the way we interact online  There is just so much it can do   said Bradley Tusk  a former campaign manager for Michael R  Bloomberg  the former mayor of New York  who has recently thrown his weight behind several blockchain projects   I love the fact that you can transmit data  information and choices in a way that is really hard to hack   really hard to disrupt and that can be really efficient  Mr  Tusk  the founder of Tusk Strategies  is an investor in some large virtual currency companies  He has also supported efforts aimed at getting governments to move voting online to blockchain based systems  Mr  Tusk argues that blockchains could make reliable online voting possible because the votes could be recorded in a tamper proof way  Everything is moving toward people saying   I want all the benefits of the internet  but I want to protect my privacy and my security    he said   The only thing I know that can reconcile those things is the blockchain  Blockchains assemble data into so called blocks that are chained together using complicated math  Since each block is built off the last one and includes information like time stamps  any attempt to go back and alter existing data would be highly complicated  In the original Bitcoin blockchain  the data in the blocks is information about Bitcoin wallets and transactions  The blocks of data in the Bitcoin blockchain   and most of its imitators   are kept by a peer to peer computer network The novel structure allows people to set up online accounts that can securely hold valuable personal information without having to trust a single entity that can hoard  abuse or lose control of the data  as happened with Facebook and the consumer credit reporting agency Equifax A range of corporations and governments are trying to apply the blockchain model   for projects from the prosaic to the radical  Various departments of the United Nations now have blockchain experiments looking to tackle climate change  the delivery of humanitarian aid and the identity challenges faced by stateless people  Coca Cola and the State Department recently announced a project to register foreign employees on a blockchain in an attempt to eliminate forced labor These experiments have drawn skepticism from Bitcoin aficionados  who say blockchains are being applied to problems that could be more easily solved with old fashioned databases Other critics say the rapid pace of blockchain development could lead to the same problem facing the broader tech industry  a willingness to disrupt and overthrow old systems before the replacement has been thoroughly tested  The blockchain industry is ready and waiting to say   Yes  we are the solution   and they have every incentive to do so   said Angela Walch  a research fellow at the Center for Blockchain Technologies at University College London   But somebody needs to ask the question   Is it actually better  Is it measurably better   Many blockchain projects opened themselves to criticism and regulatory scrutiny by raising money through so called initial coin offerings last year  These fund raising campaigns often brought in tens of millions of dollars in minutes with little regulatory oversight But new blockchain efforts continue apace  motivated in no small part by concerns about the emergence of internet giants like Facebook and YouTube Most of the biggest internet companies make their money from collecting personal information and using it to sell targeted advertisements  This kind of massive data collection makes them vulnerable to hackers and outsiders who want to leverage the data   as was evident when Cambridge Analytica improperly gained access to 50 million Facebook profiles  And start ups are using the blockchain in an attempt to pry control of all that data out of their hands Blockstack has built a way to record the basic details about your identity on a blockchain database and then use that identity to set up accounts with other online projects that are built on top of it The animating force behind the project is that users   rather than Blockstack or any other company   would end up in control of all the data they generate with any online service Blockstack is one of several blockchain based projects hoping to create a new generation of online services that don t rely on having unfettered access to our personal information The idea has gained enough steam that in the days after news of Facebook s relationship with Cambridge Analytica broke  Twitter was filled with people calling for blockchain based alternatives  As Facebook is collapsing we need to replace it with a blockchain based  decentralized platform   one user   GerdMoeBehrens  wrote   blockchain WE NEED U NOW     wrote another   andymartin46 But Mr  Berners Lee has warned that the development of the blockchain could come with unintended consequences  like more activity from criminals operating outside the oversight of governments Even blockchain advocates say the hype has conditioned people to think that good answers are close at hand  when it could take five or 10 years for the technology to properly develop In fact  most blockchain projects are still plagued by concerns about privacy  For example  the widely used Bitcoin blockchain allows certain data   details of the transactions between users   to be seen by anyone  even if other data   the users  identities   remains obscured  Voting start ups have solved this by encrypting the data before putting it on a blockchain  but there are questions about whether this will solve other privacy concerns Blockchain based accounts also rely on users keeping their own passwords or private keys  which people are famously bad at doing  With Bitcoin  when people lose their private key they lose access to the money in their account   if someone lost the private key to a blockchain based online account  they could lose access to their identity  We re not saying that tomorrow you can flip the switch and a blockchain is going to solve these problems   said Michael Casey  a co author of  The Truth Machine   a new book on the blockchain   What s important is how it opens the door to a new way of thinking about the problems we face  "

morning  Sign up here Britain s decision to leave the European Union provides pointers for investors as President Trump ratchets up trade tensions with China In the weeks following Britain s vote in 2016 for  Brexit   fears grew that the post war economic order was under serious threat  But European stock markets recovered  including Britain s  Investors came to see that the European Union was not going to break up  and Britain was not going to erect tall walls around its economy  Looking back  the panicky early reaction to Brexit seems to have sprung more from a fear of the unknown than any big threats to the global trading system  Investors took a deep breath and gained some perspective Movements in the United States stock market suggests the same thing is happening in response to President Trump s trade policies  China on Tuesday evening announced the tariffs it plans in retaliation against those President Trump is threatening  Reacting to China s announcement  the S  P  500 index plunged early on Wednesday but recovered strongly to close up 1 2 percent Investors may believe China s move will lead to drawn out negotiations  Here  Brexit is again illustrative  As the back and forth between the European Union and Britain has gone on  investors have gained more clarity and confidence  If talks between the U S  and China gain steam  the uncertainty now clouding relations between the two countries may gradually clear But the standoff between the U S  and China differs in important ways from the Brexit tensions  The U S   for instance  is in a much stronger position than Britain  China exports far more to the U S  than the U S  does to China  Limiting access to the U S  economy could hurt China s growth at a time when it is trying to overhaul important economic sectors  If investors believe that the U S  can successfully exploit its advantages to make China more friendly to foreign businesses  they may even see the trade skirmish as positive for the global economy But Brexit also flashes a warning to those expecting a big win for Mr  Trump  One of the reasons that the European Union has presented a united front is that it sees Brexit as a threat to its values and goals  Similarly  China may believe that Mr  Trump s trade attack puts some of its most deeply held aspirations under threat   and will fight back hard   Peter EavisAfter Citigroup announced plans to limit firearms sales by business customers  the question was which lenders would be the next to make a move on guns  The latest  Amalgamated Bank  the union owned bank known for its socially minded policies The firm said on Wednesday that it would adopt guidelines for lenders laid out by Everytown for Gun Safety  an advocacy group backed by Mike Bloomberg Among those recommendations   Require gun dealers to protect merchandise from burglary and theft and refuse sales to people who appear in distress or intoxicated  Require retailers to stop selling high capacity magazines and bump stocks  Require gun makers to  commit to developing innovations in firearms that will allow law enforcement to more easily solve gun crimes Amalgamated said that it would not only require all business customers to adhere to those guidelines but added that it won t invest any of its own money in gun manufacturers or distributors Here s what Amalgamated s C E O  Keith Mestrich  said in a news release   Michael J  de la MercedFacebook on Wednesday said the personal information of up to 87 million people  most of them Americans  may have been improperly shared during the 2016 election with Cambridge Analytica  a political consulting firm connected to President Trump The new figure sharply increased the company s previous estimate of how many users  information was harvested by Cambridge Analytica  The number had been put at more than 50 million users The sharing of the user data has unleashed a torrent of criticism at Facebook  the world s largest social network  The company s stock is down sharply since The New York Times and The Observer of London reported on how Cambridge Analytica improperly acquired users  data The company released the revised estimate of affected users in an extended statement on Wednesday about its plans for handling personal data  The company said it will start alerting users on April 9 about whether their information may have been shared with Cambridge Analytica In related Facebook news  Earlier on Wednesday  lawmakers in Washington had said Facebook s chief executive  Mark Zuckerberg  would testify before the

"SAN FRANCISCO   Ryan Knight  a Democratic activist in Los Angeles  called for a boycott of Apple in February because it hadn t responded to calls to delete a channel from the National Rifle Association from its streaming video service after the Parkland  Fla   school shooting  Dear  Apple   Mr  Knight wrote on Twitter   Your silence is deafening   BoycottApple   More than 330 accounts retweeted the message How did Mr  Knight post the message  He used an iPhone As the reach and influence of Silicon Valley s tech giants have increased  so have the calls to boycott their products and services  The problem is that pulling off a boycott is not exactly easy  The tech companies  products are so pervasive that they are difficult to avoid That issue was crystallized in recent weeks with Facebook  Hundreds of people deleted their accounts after revelations that the political data firm Cambridge Analytica had improperly harvested the information of 50 million Facebook users  Yet many of those same people promptly instructed their friends to find them on Instagram  which is owned by   you guessed it   Facebook  It s exactly the same company  I realize it s ridiculous   said Sachi Cunningham  a documentary filmmaker in San Francisco who deactivated her Facebook last week and shifted her attention to Instagram  where  she said  the conversation is less toxic Ms  Cunningham  who has freelanced for The New York Times  added that she had immediately begun missing Facebook as a research tool for her documentaries   I don t know if I can get out of the ecosystem   she said People looking to punish major tech companies by abstaining from their products have been bedeviled time and again by the difficulty in escaping them  After Google fired an engineer  James Damore  for criticizing the company s diversity efforts last year  hundreds of people on social media called for a boycott of the company  But an analysis of nearly 7 000 tweets using the hashtag  BoycottGoogle since August showed that 26 percent of the tweets came from devices using Google s Android software  according to Keyhole  a social media research firm One Twitter account named Milton Prescott tweeted on Aug  8   Google s firing of James Damore proves his point completely  I will no longer be using Google for any services   BoycottGoogle   The tweet came from an Android device  A message to the account went unreturned Even Breitbart is running into the same dilemma  The conservative website is planning to host a panel on how tech platforms like Facebook suppress conservative voices   and it said it would livestream the discussion on Facebook  Breitbart didn t respond to a request for comment Marisa Richardson  a program manager at a life sciences company  said she began boycotting Amazon recently after learning that it offered the NRA channel on its streaming video service  So when she needed laundry detergent  she avoided the e commerce site and instead braved the crowds and traffic   and spent a few dollars more   at a nearby Target But a few days later she shopped at the Whole Foods near her home in Oakland  Calif   I completely forgot that they re owned by Amazon   she said After the shooting in Parkland in February  gun control activists called for a boycott of certain Apple and Amazon services because they hosted the NRA channel People used the hashtag  March1NRABoycott to spread the message on social media  An analysis of about 58 500 tweets with the hashtag showed that nearly half came from an iPhone or an iPad  according to Keyhole  Those included popular tweets using the  March1NRABoycott hashtag from the actress Alyssa Milano  Had I sent the same tweets from an Android phone  the same issue would apply  There is an NRATV app for Android phones   Ms  Milano said through a spokeswoman   We are only just beginning to understand how these companies have infiltrated not only our ideologies  but also our lives in the most in depth way imaginable  Nearly a third of the 4 700 tweets using the  BoycottApple hashtag since August came from iPhones  according to Keyhole  I do have an iPhone  but as a customer of Apple s  am I not allowed to hold them accountable   Mr  Knight  the activist who used an iPhone to call for an Apple boycott  said in an interview Eddy Cue  a senior executive at Apple  recently said that the NRA channel didn t violate the company s policies  Facebook  Google and Amazon didn t respond to requests for comment Many of those who recently abandoned their Facebook accounts are still in the company s orbit  not only with Instagram but also with the company s popular messaging apps WhatsApp and Messenger When Cher recently deleted her Facebook page  she said on Twitter   2day I did something VERY HARD 4 me   But her Instagram account  with 768 000 followers  was still active Likewise  Elon Musk  chief executive of SpaceX and Tesla  deleted the Facebook pages of both companies   but left their pages and his personal account active on Instagram  The photo sharing platform  he said on Twitter  is fine  so long as it stays fairly independent  Stephen Cox  39  a woodworker in Los Angeles  recently posted on Facebook that he was deactivating his account in favor of Instagram  When someone commented that the two sites were owned by the same company  he replied   It s a double edged sword  but for me one edge is slightly more blunt than the other  Instagram has proved an effective hedge for Facebook against people losing interest or trust in its main site  While the percentage of American adults who use Facebook has remained flat at 68 percent since 2016  according to a January survey of 2 002 American adults by the Pew Research Center  Instagram use rose to 35 percent from 28 percent over that period  Instagram is also more popular with younger people than older people  according to the survey Rayven Bruzzese  26  a sign language student in Philadelphia  said she had been a frequent user of Facebook for years but deleted her account in March because she found it upsetting and a drain on her time  Now she spends her time on Instagram While she acknowledged the irony of moving to another Facebook owned service  she said her options were limited  Few of her friends are on Twitter  and many have stopped using Snapchat  Where am I supposed to go   she said   I wish there was something else  "
"Amazon ran a commercial on this year s Super Bowl that pretended its digital assistant Alexa had temporarily lost her voice  It featured celebrities like Rebel Wilson  Cardi B and even the company s chief executive  Jeff Bezos While the ad riffed on what Alexa can say to users  the more intriguing question may be what she and other digital assistants can hear   especially as more people bring smart speakers into their homes Amazon and Google  the leading sellers of such devices  say the assistants record and process audio only after users trigger them by pushing a button or uttering a phrase like  Hey  Alexa  or  O K   Google   But each company has filed patent applications  many of them still under consideration  that outline an array of possibilities for how devices like these could monitor more of what users say and do  That information could then be used to identify a person s desires or interests  which could be mined for ads and product recommendations In one set of patent applications  Amazon describes how a  voice sniffer algorithm  could be used on an array of devices  like tablets and e book readers  to analyze audio almost in real time when it hears words like  love   bought  or  dislike   A diagram included with the application illustrated how a phone call between two friends could result in one receiving an offer for the San Diego Zoo and the other seeing an ad for a Wine of the Month Club membership Some patent applications from Google  which also owns the smart home product maker Nest Labs  describe how audio and visual signals could be used in the context of elaborate smart home setups One application details how audio monitoring could help detect that a child is engaging in  mischief  at home by first using speech patterns and pitch to identify a child s presence  one filing said  A device could then try to sense movement while listening for whispers or silence  and even program a smart speaker to  provide a verbal warning  A separate application regarding personalizing content for people while respecting their privacy noted that voices could be used to determine a speaker s mood using the  volume of the user s voice  detected breathing rate  crying and so forth   and medical condition  based on detected coughing  sneezing and so forth  The same application outlines how a device could  recognize a T shirt on a floor of the user s closet  bearing Will Smith s face and combine that with a browser history that shows searches for Mr  Smith  to provide a movie recommendation that displays   You seem to like Will Smith  His new movie is playing in a theater near you   In a statement  Amazon said the company took  privacy seriously  and did  not use customers  voice recordings for targeted advertising   Amazon said that it filed  a number of forward looking patent applications that explore the full possibilities of new technology   and that they  take multiple years to receive and do not necessarily reflect current developments to products and services  Google said it did not  use raw audio to extrapolate moods  medical conditions or demographic information   The company added   All devices that come with the Google Assistant  including Google Home  are designed with user privacy in mind  Tech companies apply for a dizzying number of patents every year  many of which are never used and are years from even being possible Still  Jamie Court  the president of Consumer Watchdog  a nonprofit advocacy group in Santa Monica  Calif   which published a study of some of the patent applications in December  said   When you read parts of the applications  it s really clear that this is spyware and a surveillance system meant to serve you up to advertisers  The companies  Mr  Court added  are  basically going to be finding out what our home life is like in qualitative ways  Google called Consumer Watchdog s claims  unfounded   and said   Prospective product announcements should not necessarily be inferred from our patent applications  A recent Gallup poll found that 22 percent of Americans used devices like Google Home or Amazon Echo  The growing adoption of smart speakers means that gadgets  some of which contain up to eight microphones and a camera  are being placed in kitchens and bedrooms and used to answer questions  control appliances and make phone calls  Apple recently introduced its own version  called the HomePod But many consumers are also becoming increasingly nervous that tech companies are eavesdropping on them in order to serve them targeted ads  no matter how often the companies deny it  The recent revelations that a British political data firm  Cambridge Analytica  improperly harvested the information of 50 million Facebook users has only added to the public s wariness over the collection and use of personal information Facebook  in fact  had planned to unveil its new internet connected home products at a developer conference in May  according to Bloomberg News  which reported that the company had scuttled that idea partly in response to the recent fallout Both Amazon and Google have emphasized that devices with Alexa and Google Assistant store voice recordings from users only after they are intentionally triggered  Amazon s Echo and its newer smart speakers with screens use lights to show when they are streaming audio to the cloud  and consumers can view and delete their recordings on the Alexa smartphone app or on Amazon s website  though they are warned online that  may degrade  their experience   Google Home also has a light that indicates when it is recording  and users can similarly see and delete that audio online Amazon says voice recordings may help fulfill requests and improve its services  while Google says the data helps it learn over time to provide better  more personalized responses But the ecosystem around voice data is still evolving Take the thousands of third party apps developed for Alexa called  skills   which can be used to play games  dim lights or provide cleaning advice  While Amazon said it didn t share users  actual recordings with third parties  its terms of use for Alexa say it may share the content of their requests or information like their ZIP codes  Google says  it will  generally  not provide audio recordings to third party service providers  but may send transcriptions of what people say And some devices have already shown that they are capable of recording more than what users expect  Google faced some embarrassment last fall when a batch of Google Home Minis that it distributed at company events and to journalists were almost constantly recording In a starker example  detectives investigating a death at an Arkansas home sought access to audio on an Echo device in 2016  Amazon resisted  but the recordings were ultimately shared with the permission of the defendant  James Bates   A judge later dismissed Mr  Bates s first degree murder charge based on separate evidence  Kathleen Zellner  his lawyer  said in an interview that the Echo had been recording more than it was supposed to  Mr  Bates told her that it had been regularly lighting up without being prompted  and had logged conversations that were unrelated to Alexa commands  including a conversation about football in a separate room  she said  It was just extremely sloppy the way the activation occurred   Ms  Zellner said The Electronic Privacy Information Center has recommended more robust disclosure rules for internet connected devices  including an  algorithmic transparency requirement  that would help people understand how their data was being used and what automated decisions were then being made about them Sam Lester  the center s consumer privacy fellow  said he believed that the abilities of new smart home devices highlighted the need for United States regulators to get more involved with how consumer data was collected and used  A lot of these technological innovations can be very good for consumers   he said   But it s not the responsibility of consumers to protect themselves from these products any more than it s their responsibility to protect themselves from the safety risks in food and drugs  It s why we established a Food and Drug Administration years ago  "
" Good Monday  Here s what we re watching   Elon Musk finally responded to last week s bad news about Tesla   Trump continues to go after Amazon   China retaliated to President Trump s steel and aluminum tariffs   Tech leaders have been keeping mum on Facebook Get this in your inbox each morning  Sign up here For months  the stock market rally seemed to have the strength to plow through the obstacles that the Trump administration threw in its way But now  the S  P  500 index is down more than 10 percent from its all time high President Donald Trump s actions seem to be increasingly taking their toll  When the Trump administration first pushed for steel and aluminum tariffs in February  investors weren t happy  but the market soon rebounded  Now investors seem to be growing more nervous as the United States  biggest trading partners show signs that they are ready to fight back  China s retaliatory tariffs  which appear to be more stringent than expected  suggest the country will take a hard stance Early in his presidency  investors quickly learned to shrug off  Mr  Trump s criticism of companies  In recent days  though  Mr  Trump has targeted Amazon in tweets  asserting that the company has an unfair advantage  It s not clear what he could do to hurt Amazon s business  but the company s stock has plunged  Amazon s shares may well bounce back  but the criticism has added to investors  concerns about the outlook for large technology companies  whose soaring stock prices spearheaded the rally that took to the S  P  500 to its all time high in January Too much blame can be placed on the White House  however Before investors began fretting about tech and trade  the underpinnings of the stock market s ascent were perhaps not as robust as they looked  Wall Street analysts expect earnings for the companies in the S  P  500 to increase 25 percent this year  according to data compiled by Standard   Poor s  an unusually large jump that was reflected in the stock market valuations  Much of that projected earnings increase is coming from tax cuts and some from expectations that companies  revenue would grow at a nice clip as global growth stayed strong The tax cuts are certainly going to improve profits  But rising interest rates around the world could weigh somewhat on companies  revenue growth  And if wages and other costs come in higher than expected   a significant possibility when the economy is suffering a shortage of some workers   profit margins could get squeezed   I don t think either of those are in the numbers   said Jim Paulsen  chief market strategist at the Leuthold Group   Peter EavisA little humor has not cleared the clouds over Tesla Shares in the company were once again sliding on Monday after the company s C E O   Elon Musk  joked on April 1 that Tesla had gone bankrupt  an apparent attempt to make light of concerns that the electric car maker is straining under its debt load Tesla s stock is now down 35 percent from its high of last year  A major reason for the slide is the company s struggles to meet production targets for its lower priced Model 3 car  Delays  of course  raise questions about Tesla s ability to become an efficient mass producer of autos  The company needs to sell a significantly higher number of cars to generate the cash to finance its business and meet debt payments  Tesla is expected early this week to release its first quarter production and delivery numbers Electrek  a publication that covers electric vehicles  reported late Monday morning that Mr  Musk had sent out an email to employees saying that the company was producing more than 2 000 Model 3s a week  Tesla s stock bounced after the report Tesla s technology is also facing intense scrutiny after one of its Model X cars crashed on March 23  killing the driver  Tesla said late Friday that its assisted driving system  called Autopilot  was engaged in the car before its collision with a concrete divider  As our colleague Neal E  Boudette wrote Tesla s website says one of Autopilot s safety features is  Automatic Emergency Braking   But a Tesla owner s manual warns riders that this feature  is not designed to avoid a collision   Wired recently reported that systems like Autopilot are not necessarily designed to detect static obstacles  In the words of one expert Doubts about the fundamental capabilities of Tesla s Autopilot could crimp demand for its cars among a customer base that is often seeking the best technology Questions are also swirling around the timing of Tesla s announcement about the crash  In its first communication about the accident  the company said The investigation is not over  Yet Tesla went ahead and provided its update on Friday  The motive for doing so is not clear  The United States National Transportation Safety Board on Sunday said it was  unhappy  that Tesla had released information about the crash   Peter EavisTech companies are again dragging down

3 percent Over that period the business models of those companies have come under increased scrutiny  News that Cambridge Analytica  a political data firm hired by President Trump s 2016 election campaign  gained access to private information on more than 50 million Facebook users has weighed not only on the shares of Facebook but on Alphabet as well  Amazon  meanwhile  has come under attack from President Trump In all  those companies have lost more than  300 billion in market value the past two weeks President Trump attacked the e commerce again on Monday morning Monday s tweet is the latest over the past five days from Mr  Trump criticizing Amazon  Over that period  Mr  Trump has accused Amazon of not paying enough taxes  of putting thousands of local retailers out of business and of using the United States Postal Service as its  Delivery Boy  Mr  Trump s willingness to again single out Amazon and characterize it as a tax cheat and a job killer is a remarkable use of the presidential bully pulpit that could have serious implications for the company even without any formal moves by the federal government Amazon s shares are down 4 percent and are off nearly 11 percent since Axios reported on Wednesday about Mr  Trump s anger toward the company Context  Amazon has said that the Postal Regulatory Commission  which oversees the service  has consistently found that its

 SAC Capital Advisors  and most recently served as head of global trading at Point72 The timing of Mr  Villhauer s departure came just months before Mr  Cohen was to begin managing money for outside investors In January  Mr  Cohen reconfigured Point72 as a hedge fund after establishing it as a family office in 2014 to manage  11 billion of his personal wealth  Point72 has said it has raised between  2 billion and  4 billion in outside money Mr  Villhauer had been with Mr  Cohen through both the good days and bad days  He was there when SAC turned into a powerhouse hedge fund  and he was there when the fund pleaded guilty to insider trading charges in 2013  The guilty plea required the firm to stop managing money for outside investors When Mr  Villhauer left Point72  Mr  Cohen  in a letter to employees  called the departure a  retirement  and said he was sad to see Mr  Villhauer go Now Mr  Villhauer will start a new chapter in his career at another well known hedge fund firm

turmoil continued this weekend after a 2016 memo was leaked in which Andrew Bosworth  a vice president  wrote   Maybe someone dies in a terrorist attack coordinated on our tools  And still we connect people  The ugly truth is that we believe in connecting people so deeply that anything that allows us to connect more people more often is  de factor  good  Mr  Bosworth and Mark Zuckerberg disavowed the memo  but the fallout has been wide  with employees calling for a hunt to find leakers Critic s corner  Mr  Zuckerberg s comments suggest he still doesn t get it  What matters is not whether
